Favorite flavors: caramel macchiato and the au lait.We had one of Dolce Gusto machines since 2012, nothing happened it still works perfectly. We go this one, which is an upgraded version - less bulky, controlled volume of liquid, and still simple to use.PROS\\n- Doesn\\'t take up much space\\n- Easy to use machine.\\n- Easy to use pods (follow the top instructions on the pod).\\n- It\\'s quick! You flip that switch and the coffee comes out instantly hot.\\n- Aside from the start up issue, I use it once daily without issue (so far). I\\'ve been using it about 9 months. I will update if I run into problems.\\n- This machine is causing me to drink less coffee because small amounts come out.\\n- Note that the regular coffees and espressos have intensity levels and come stronger or weaker. There is a number given on the front of the box. Goes up to 10, I believe (never seen a flavor above 9 though). My favorite is the Americano Veranda from Starbucks, which is a 6 level. The 5 level Medium Roast tastes watery and is a bit too weak for me, so I never put the higher water level for that flavor.... but not bad on the rare occasion that I want a second cup or when I just want weak coffee on some days.\\n- If you have/buy a glass mug, your coffee really will look as tasty as the product photo!\\n- Easy to make tea, just turn it on without the coffee pod for hot water-- nice since I go through tea-only phases\\n\\nCONS\\n- The machine didn\\'t work when I first bought it. We did an Internet search for reasons why, and in our case, it was related to the water tank/line. We had to fill it with water and put it in place. Then lift it out of place. Then put it back. Then lift it out of place. Then put it back. We had to do this pull it off and on thing maybe 15-20 times (you might have to do more). Apparently the issue had something to do with air pockets in the line and you have to force the water through manually. Who knows. But eventually it started working. After 9 months of use, that was the only time I had to do that. But an instant 3 stars for this first impression alone and the lack of warning.\\n- Limited choice of pods. You can\\'t use the K-cups in this machine. You have to buy the Dolce Gusto pods. I did find one or two obscure brands that can be used with this machine but they are just as pricey and one choked up my machine so I threw it out.\\n- Pods are becoming less and less available. I don\\'t know if it\\'s related to the pandemic or what but many flavors are no longer available since I got the machine. And you won\\'t find these offline.\\n- Pods are ridiculously expensive. Pretty much the same price (OFTEN MORE) as going to one of the big chains.\\n- Not bad tasting coffee tbh, but not as flavorful as the big chains. I have become a bigger shopper of creamers as a result. Sweet cream with no flavors is the best (personally I love Fairlife Sweet Cream Creamer... less sugar and no weird aftertaste).\\n- Use a SMALL coffee cup so you won\\'t be disappointed. Most of these pods won\\'t give you the big cup of coffee you may be used to. I had to measure them in a measuring cup because I was so shocked at the small amount it made in my big cup. It was about a cup. The regular coffees like Medium Roast (non-milky) will make more.\\n- A number of these flavors require TWO PODS. Each will be a different color. But this also means that if you get a box of 16 pods, you\\'re really only getting 8 cups.\\n- The red cord is an eye sore.\\n- I have found exactly one DECAF option... and it\\'s double the price of other flavors!\\n- Check the expiration dates on the pods. One flavor expired after just 2 months of purchase. All the others will expire within a year of purchase (spectrum of 2-11 months for mine-- most 4-6 months).\\n- AVOID the GRANA CAFE pods which claim to be Nescafe Dolce Gusto Compatible. Read the reviews!! They will damage your machine!! Mine coughed and sputtered and didn\\'t seem to have the pressure needed for the pod. I threw them out as reviewers stated repeated use can damage your machine.\\n\\nI\\'ve decided to use it up until my coffee stash runs out. Then it\\'s going in the garage and I will explore something new. After close to a year with the machine, the pod issues are the biggest negatives at this point.I already have an espresso machine, but bought this one to make cappuccinos and macchiatos quickly. The machine is priced fairly, compact, not very fancy (plastic), easy to operate and clean, and makes good coffee. The temp of the coffee is perfect for me. I have to wait a bit to drink it. Some reviews claim the coffee doesn\\'t come out hot enough. That may be the case for those who drink their coffee as soon as it\\'s brewed. I can\\'t handle that level of heat. It burns my tongue. I\\'m not so sure about the design... You have to slide and hold the knob on the back to one side for a couple of seconds after the coffee starts brewing. If you let go too soon the machine stops and you have to slide it to one side again. Not a deal breaker, but an odd design. To brew cold you slide to one side and hot to the other. I haven\\'t had other people try the cream/coffee pods, but I personally like the flavor of Nescafe blends. My husband likes the medium roast (no cream for him). The cream has a hint a sweetness, but not sweet. I like that. The hot chocolate is okay. So far, very happy and already bought over 100 pods. I haven\\'t tried the cold brews yet. Availability of pods may be an issue since this machine is more popular in Europe and South America. I had to buy 3 to 4 boxes of each, and one mixed pack. If you wanna try one box first, that may be a problem. I have only used the Nescafe pods. I read that you can buy stainless steel pods for this machine but I already have an espresso machine so this one is for convenience and speed.Trying desperately to ween myself off of expensive Starbucks habit during Covid, but have no attention span or patience to tamp my own espresso. So many machines on Amazon that I was unable to make a decision and I\\'m cheap at heart even though I will pay extra for quality when justified. So I decided to give this machine a whirl since the price can\\'t be beaten. Having travelled outside of the US quite extensively, I was aware that Nescafe has more coffee options internationally. The machine is ridiculously easy to use, looks very European and the thick, red cord does not bother me, but totally understand why others may find it a turnoff. All of the coffees and espressos I have tried so far are quite tasty and I find I prefer the Nescafe brands over the Starbucks pods offered. I tried the Nescafe Cappuccino first and the espresso by itself is amazing with hints of dark chocolate. The milk pods are surprisingly good, but I do not like sugar in any coffee drinks period so I would only use the milk pods as a treat rather than everyday use. I rely on my Nespresso Aeroccino3 - highly recommend! - that allows me to steam and froth any milk I desire (mostly lactaid-free non-fat). I do agree with other reviewers that you should stick to the number of bars recommended for the water level/cup size and then add hot water separately if you find the coffee to be too strong. That is the only thing I found frustrating - I want a 12 oz cup every time so you may have to use several pods combined with the desired amount of frothed milk to get to 12 oz. But it\\'s probably no different in the end than having to pay extra for a triple shot in a venti at Starbucks. For sure it is cheaper than having your Starbucks delivered by Uber Eats or - god forbid - having to leave the house to pick up your mobile order, especially when you have no time during the work week. I found some \"Italian Coffee\" brand pods on Amazon that are made in Italy that combine the milk/espresso in a single pod that are very good and by using 1 of those pods + 2 other espresso/coffee pods + adding my own frothed milk, I can create my own delicious lattes and macchiatos. I rated 4 stars for Blending Power based on above, but don\\'t really understand what \"Blending Power\" means otherwise. I totally understand other reviewers\\' frustration with availability of pods and price increase, but for me since I just got this machine, it\\'s still cheaper and more convenient than Starbucks. My ONLY true complaint is that the pods are NOT recyclable, which sickens me. But I\\'ll stick with this for now and when I need to upgrade/replace will switch to brand that is fully recyclable. Hopefully Nescafe will have this covered by then!I bought one for my mother, took it to her in my recent trip to Brazil. We all loved it! So easy to use and the coffee is so good. Yes, the pods are a little expensive, but I got also some compatible silicone pods that can be filled with coffee and used over and over again. When I came back home my Keurig coffeemaker broke and made me very happy, as I went ahead and bought a Dolce Gusto for myself! Cappuccino is my favorite, and I like also the intense espresso.Hasta que funciono bien que fue el dia de hoy todo fue muy bueno y perfecto, es facil de usar y muy practica, hoy comence a ver un salidero de agua por la parte de abajo de la cafetera, estoy necesitando saber de la garantia porque todavia no tiene un ano, como me puedo contactar con el vendedor...Easy to use and variety of coffee flavors is wonderfulI\\'m originally from the UK and pretty much everyone has one of these (at a much reduced price I might add). I really like the taste of the coffee that has the foamy milk such as the Latte and Cappuccino so I bought one in the US. My main problem is that the price of the pods in the US is twice the price in the UK. That\\'s all !Not sure why those machine costs Doo much better in the States. I bought the exact one while ion Germany for less than half. .. But I digress. This is a great lil machine. No need to spend hundreds one others, especially if your like those Italian inspired coffees! Be careful, however, when picking reusable pods. I\\'ve bought some duds already. Works excellent with the pre-packaged pods tho!Purchased the machine to replace my German Bought Krups - Nescafé Dolce Gusto Piccolo. Having lived in Germany, I enjoyed the convenience of the machine and the absolutely great coffee it made. Having moved back the USA, I could not find that machine for sale.\\n\\nI discovered that this machine \" the NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto Coffee Machine, Genio 2, Espresso, Cappuccino and Latte Pod Machine\" was available here in the USA.\\n\\n-Coffee Maker-\\nA few remarks. This is a \"commercial coffee maker\". That is made for the \"hospitality industry\" as it says.\\nIt is about the same size as my home machine the \"Krups - Nescafé Dolce Gusto Piccolo\". It is about twice as expensive, but also, it appears, a bit more heavy duty.\\n\\nIt also has more \"bells and whistles\". One nice feature is the ability to adjust the coffee size. That is 12 oz, 10 oz, 8 Oz and all the way down to Espresso size. Lights and a toggle switch show the size of the coffee.\\n\\n-Automatic-\\nWith this machine, you can pop in your coffee capsule and set the machine and walk away. It will stop automatically.\\n\\nThis being a commercial model, it has a larger water tank. Which means less trips to the faucet to refill.\\n\\n-Taste-\\nAs far as taste, I just got it and have made 3 cups on two days, so far. Too me, it tastes just like the coffee in Germany that I made on the other Dolce Gusto machine.\\n\\nUnlike the K-cup machines, this produces a real \"Crema\". The coffee is made at 15 Bar of pressure. Like an Espresso machine. It produces a really nice Crema on the coffee and has a real good taste.\\n\\nFor the price that I paid, around $100 bucks, I think it is a great deal, especially compared to the K-cup machines.\\n\\n--Suggestion--\\nSome people apparently complain that they want it the coffee more hot. It seems hot enough to me. I do pre-heat my coffee cups to maintain the warmth and taste.\\n\\n--Closing Remarks--\\nThis Coffee/Espresso maker is made for the USA with 120 Volts.\\n\\nThe only inconvenient thing, is you can not run to the store and pick up capsules. But Amazon and other major online vendors sell them. If you shop well, you can get the capsules at a cheap price.\\n\\nThe Coffee Machine looks well made, and heavy duty. It is cheaper than the Nespresso machine and most of the Keurig Coffee makers.\\n\\nThis combo Coffee maker and Espresso maker looks to be a great deal. I wish Nestle would focus again on home use. Having said that, if you like European Style coffee with ease of making and great taste, this is the machine.Facil de usarI\\'m on my third Genio (which doesn\\'t look like the one shown...mine has two extra 10/12 oz. options above the usual 7 intensity settings) and I like it in spite of the flaky behavior when trying to use those other seven settings. E.g., when I set mine to, say, five bars for cafe con leche, the last one at the bottom doesn\\'t cycle through, but for the 10/12 oz. choice, it works fine. The coffee gurus at Illy say that a cup should take approx. 30 seconds to brew properly, and so the Genio does pretty well. My \"price-per-cup\" benchmark for even going with Dolce Gusto was once .50$Am. Those days are clearly gone but I shop around for as close to that as I can get for the three-pak pod boxes. My experience with also-rans like Metasa has been that they\\'re poor quality to use and maybe even dangerous (leaky). In ten years of using my Genios I\\'ve never had a bonafide Dolce Gusto capsule fail. YGWYPF.... .\\n\\nAn 11/26/21 follow-up: Amazon\\'s got a 40% coupon thing going on the Genio -- but it\\'s not the same model as I bought a year ago with 9 brew settings. It seems to be a throw-back to the original Genio/Piccolo setup with seven settings. So a caveat is in order here. But if you go for it and don\\'t heed the Dolce capsules that call for 9 settings, then no big deal.\\n\\nIf you\\'re replacing an older Genio, keep the water reservoir for the new machine if it doesn\\'t leak. This is my second machine in few months. Breaks or stop working easily. I received the second one on Tuesday, and look at the results! I only reordered it because I like the coffee flavor!My wife and I love this machine. Now, when we originally bought this machine, we were thinking it could replace our regular coffee maker as well. That didn\\'t work out so well. The coffee pods are generally more expensive and from what we found, only available online. We bought some of the reusable pods for traditional coffee. But we had a few problems with those. One, sometimes, even if they are aligned correctly, they can get stuck and you have to really finagle the tray to get it out. Two, sometimes they stream will spray in a skewed direction and miss your coffee cup and make a mess. Three, I found I needed to use two pods to get one cup of coffee to the strength and amount I like.\\n\\nNow, all that being said, for speciality drinks, we love this machine! Espressos, macchiatos, etc are delicious. We enjoy those on a regular basis. We did finally break down and get a Keurig though for regular coffee drinking.\\n\\nFinally... the orange cord for the plug is incredibly stupid. It looks like we are doing construction in our kitchen with that thing. Why they couldn\\'t just make it black is beyond me.Originally, I didn’t want the product because it wasn’t what I thought I ordered. I looked at many different items, I guess this is the one I choose. However, turns out it is awesome; very easy to use. I just have to order the right pods!!We love the flavor and how easy to clean this coffee machine is. But unfortunately the pods are very expensive if you compare whit other brands like Keurig or even Nespresso pods.\\nAlso they claim to have a recycle program so they will send you a box to send back the used pods. But we have been waiting since December for the first box! You can imagine the amount of pods that we collected in this 3 months (approx 4 pods per day is something close to 300 pods). We had submitted two requests trough the website and we also called them to ask for the box. But we have received none. We finally gave up and had to throw them to the trash (what make me sick) but after having keeping them for more than two months they started smelling horrible.\\nSadly I’m just switching to another coffee machine brand. I was so excited about this one but unfortunately my first experience with a pod’s one wasn’t a successThis coffee maker is amazing! I finally upgraded from my old 12 cupper that I’ve had since college despite seeing most of the bad reviews. I decided why not since it was a good deal. It arrived with the box a little damaged but I did buy one that had been sent back and it said the box would be damaged. I pulled out the machine and there wasn’t a scratch on it anywhere! We plugged it in and got it set up and it worked beautifully! One of my favorite parts about this machine is that it can do hot or cold coffee!! I much prefer iced coffee but it makes great hot coffee too. I ordered a set of pods that was all in Italian, the Nescafé pods and the Starbucks pods. The Italian ones are ok but are mostly smaller cups or espresso shots. The Starbucks ones are definitely worth it, They taste great! I haven’t got the Nescafé ones yet so I’m not sure how they taste. Yes the power cord is bright red but I don’t mind it. I also love how compact it is! We have a small galley kitchen in our townhouse so there’s not a ton of counter space and this doesn’t take up much at all!! Overall very satisfied with my purchase. Just take the chance! Worst that happens is you don’t like it and send it back!I\\'ve had this coffee maker for five years now and it is one of the best decision take ever. I thought es use it for a while and then archive it as usually happens, but we use it every single day several times. I can\\'t rate \\'Flavor\\' here because it only depends on your selection, not in the coffee maker. We love Italian-style coffee and we tried several home coffee makers, but none of them was even close to real espresso or cappuccino. It was a hidden treasure discovering this coffee maker!!! On regards to is size, even that the first impression is it is a toy, it is perfect. It doesn\\'t take significant room in your kitchen and the quality of the coffees is awesome.Had one of the originals. And replaced after 4 years with this, slightly cheaper version. Original eventually leaked and couldn’t trace the problem. I think it was the pump. This one has lasted 1 1/2 years. For some reason doesn’t want to pump, not sure why. I opened it up and the tubing and components inside look as if they’re new, no corrosion, no damage, so no idea, maybe pump internals? We have quite a few pods left, so I’ll probably end up getting another to finish them off. Ours is a hard water area, so wondered if this is the root cause, not sure…. Coffees ok, but pods are scarce in some flavors and prices fluctuate widely…. Ce la vie huh?I’ve had this for 6 months now. We use is almost daily. We use the pods that are recommended for it and we buy them off of Amazon. It’s makes great hot coffee, macchiatos, lattes etc. Perfect for our tastes and needs. When we first got it, I couldn’t figure out how to use it. But quickly realized that some people are having issues because they aren’t following the steps in the “right order”. Step 1) push the on button to preheat the machine. This should take all but 30 seconds. Step 2) lift the handle to unlock the pod holder and pull it out. 3) Put the pod in, push it back. 4) use the toggle to set the bars as indicated on the pod itself (push the toggle up and down to set the bars). 5) now push the handle down to lock into place. 6) Push the SAME toggle LEFT for cold and RIGHT for hot.\\nYou’ll hear the machine make noises as it begins to dispense.\\n7) Repeat with the second pod.\\n8) remove used pod after done.\\n\\nPoint to note: We only use this for hot beverages. We tried cold and they weren’t cold enough and tasted a bit watered down. So if you’re buying this mainly for cold beverages, try it for yourself before you decide since taste preferences are so varied.Need missing part but can’t get just the part from the manufacturer or from AmazonI like that’s easy to use and clean… I don’t like that i I drink to much coffee now but i love itI don’t know how to make the top layer.The coffee pods that you put your own coffee in gets struck and I cannot remove it. It is stuck. I need to return it to have the pod removed or the machine does not work. and it does not come our hot.I likeEl precio no es cómodoThis was a purchase which was expected to produce a mediocre cup of coffee. It produced a surprisingly consistent fine treat, and we look forward to every cup without the rigamarole of a more elaborate system. The separately purchased cups to use our own grinds work well too. What a surprise!i tried k cup and espresso machines in past. espresso machines are expensive and hard to maintain. but this dolce gusto coffee machine is really perfect for some one who does not want to spend too much money on coffee machines and it tastes much better than K cup machine. I tried all kinds on this dolceo gusto machine and i loved it. My favorite flaors are Machat Latte import from Japan and starbucks Latte Macciato. Starbucks lattes were so idential to actual lattes in starbucks coffee shop. and i am gold memeber who spends at least 500 usd per month for ice tea and lattes on starbucks coffee store. and now i rarely go to starbucks coffee because of this machine. and it is very reasonable price and easy to handle. not so hard to wash and clean either. I love it. Para Benz!Me agrado todo.muy fácil de usarIt’s hard to find capsules and when you find is super expensive, besides when they have in stock are expired. I loved this machine when I was in Brazil because there they have the Nescafé website where you can buy many options. Here in the US you just have Amazon as store and very few sellers have in stock. I wasted my money on this purchaseI used a machine like this at a B&B I stayed at recently, and the coffee was frickin\\' fantastic! Better than my own french press! Trouble is, you have to order the pods online as they\\'re not sold in stores. Another issue is that it really makes tiny cups of coffee if you match the bars on the pod with the bars on the machine. So I actually dial in more bars on the machine, and it does make the coffee a little weaker, but at least I get more of it. I can\\'t say whether I\\'d buy it again because it\\'s a pretty expensive endeavor for a cup of coffee (and more expensive if you drink lots of coffee!). I am considering purchasing one of those reusable pods and using my own coffee, but the reviews didn\\'t look to promising. I wouldn\\'t recommend it for someone on a fixed budget.I purchased this for personal use, not commercial. The machine is easy to use, makes a steaming cup and looked nice on the counter. However, the coffee pods tasted like plastic to me. It had an odd taste, and I tried 2 different products and made multiple cups but it still tasted off to me. It could be my taste buds, but I didn\\'t love the product so I returned it.Great espresso pod machine. Lots of great flavors. Only negative is you can\\'t buy the pods in a lot of places. Either Walmart or online only. I just ordered the cafe au lait, let\\'s see if it\\'s a cafe au lait or a latte like most American coffee shops serve.I was a little hesitant to buy this for Christmas present from my husband but it ended up being a great machine we love to have cappuccino but don’t always get out of the house to get it in the evening and it does end up getting a little pricey the only downside is you have to buy the prepackaged cups online and it does get expensive but overall very happyEstá muy bien mi esposa le súper encantoThis is the 3rd Nescafé Dolce that I have purchased. Wouldn’t have any other. I just wish you could purchase capsules that provided more coffee so you could make a 10 or 12 oz cup. Currently you have to use 4 capsules to get a full flavor…I was using this for 2 months and it was fine. One morning the water would not come out and I tried to descale it as recommended. Unfortunately I couldn\\'t because the water needle was bent. I carefully unbent it, and then it broke off. I can\\'t find replacement part or find the model on the app. To request a repair. Very sad.Nothing to complain so far on the machine. Just received the new one. Already had one that lasted 6 years. The new version looks a bit cheap but does the job. My main complain is the red cable. It looks totally ugly, like a mistake.I love this little machine. It doesn\\'t take up much room on my countertop. The red cord is different but who cares when you can make coffee better than the shops in your own home. Even more so because I have so many sugar free syrup options at home when my favorite coffee shop only has SF vanilla.Great for busy mornings, quick and easy.This easy-to-use coffee maker. When U visited Italy a few years ago, I stated in a hotel that served breakfast. They had a cappuccino maker that I fell in love with. This item is a smaller version, but the result is the same. Experiment with the foam versus coffee ratio. I didn’t care for the Caramel macchiato one, myself. It is an inexpensive indulgence!Love the product .. only used a few times , but went to clean dripping tray this time after my cappuccino & it was full of mold ;(. I’ve had a kuerig for years and haven’t cleaned the tray after each use and never had an issue with it . This is truly disgusting and I can’t seem to get anyone on phone to speak with . Again I’ve only made about 4 cups with it since I’ve had it for about 2 monthsI have owned Dolce Gusto coffee machines for about 10 years. It seemed that there alway a newer better machine available. I like the Genio 2, but it has taken one tiny step down from the original Genio. Now, unlike the original Genio, you can\\'t set up the machine and push the button for start so that it will begin automatically once the water is hot. Now you have to wait for the water to get hot and then start the machine. You can\\'t walk away and know your coffee will be ready when you walk back.We bought it at the end of 2021, just getting around to using it now, April 2022. We rinsed the water reserve one time and it cracked.The only thing that I do not like is the power cord is red.I like this very much is very easy to handleGreat tasteI went back and forth on ordering this unit since it’s not eco friendly, but took the plunge. I had a tassimo in the past and assumed it would be similar and have more flavor than kcup machines. In my opinion, k cups taste great the first month and then quickly go down hill.\\n\\nIn any case, I bought 3 different types of coffee capsules: flat white, Starbucks americano and Nestles Americano.\\n\\nTurns out the flat white is instant. It’s ok, but instant coffee always tastes like instant coffee. Both Americanos, are pretty tasteless. Surprisingly, the Starbucks brand is much weaker than the Nestles. The Nestles is “fine” at 5 (don’t waste a capsule trying at the recommended 6). I didn’t buy this thing to have “fine” or “ok” coffee. So disappointing, as it’s very easy to use as is a decent temperature.\\n\\nMaybe it’s just the coffee capsules I bought and I’ll find others with flavor, but Americano should have body and there is no body so I’m not hopeful.I love Cafe Au Lait, which is the only reason I purchased another Dolce Gusto coffee machine when my first one stopped working. It’s inconvenient that I can’t find capsules anywhere except online (except in Cozumel while on vacation).I was nervous to buy this machine because I already have a $500 barista express by Breville, Which is much more maintenance and time consuming so I decided to go for a change. This NesCafe Machine is AMAZING. Quality coffee done in a flash. The pods make it so you don\\'t have to sit there and steam milk (which has always required more cleanup in my case.) and the coffee pods come in a variety of flavors. Café style coffee right at home for what equals about $1 a cup instead of $5, Sometimes even $7 at your local Starbucks. I will be using this every day and if you are considering ordering this, do yourself a favor and go for it!I love it!!!El único problema que le veo es que en l foto se ve mejor el café hecho que en la vida real, ya que las mezclas de las fotos que muestra en la página, no dan el tamaño real de cómo se ve en l fotoMade my first latte and came out perfect.\\nI was skeptical for its price but since I’m the only who drinks coffee this small machine is perfect! Just to update this review… a few weeks after the hot option stopped working so I’m only able to brew my coffee with the cold option and have to heat it up in the microwave… I wish I trusted the other reviewers… DO NOT purchase this machine if you don’t have a microwave!What were they thinking ?? Had to replace my original Nescafe Dolce coffee maker which was very well designed. Ordered this new version.....what a MISTAKE. They redesigned the entire thing. The water reservoir is much deeper pushing unit too far out on the counter and does NOT pull out easily. The on/off button is now in the back out of reach. Most offensive redesign is the BRIGHT RED power cord which looks like it should hook up to a generator. Looks ridiculous on the kitchen counter. If I keep it I will be hiding it in a cabinet. Had this been shown on the website I would NEVER have purchased it. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!! My original maker was very well designed. SO DISAPPOINTEDI am not that picky of a coffee drinker. I\\'m curious how others are saying the coffee is good. I purchased two Nescafee brand capsules and one starbucks brand. Starbucks is good. The nescafee cappuccino and cafe au lait are definitely NOT good. I would not have purchased this if I had known my decent flavor options were limited. Maybe I got unlucky with those.\\n\\nOn the plus side, it does make hot drinks fairly quickly and is easy to use. It might become an expensive hot water dispenser in my office though.Coffee isn’t very hot. Would get the next model up next time.Good jobI really love this machine. I can control how much coffee I want in my drink since I’m not supposed to have coffee because of my arthritis. This allows me to put very little coffee syrup and not overdue it. I’m a happy camper!I bought it 2 years ago and I didn’t use it everyday. Today when I wanted to drink coffee it did not work. Very disappointed!!! It turns on but the water does not go through.I had the older version and this one is even better. Coffees are great. I couldn’t figure out the water adjustment switch at first because instructions are pictures. Finally in my old age saw the arrow on the on/off switch that you toggle it forward or back to adjust the amount of water per your pod.The machine looks lovely. I really liked the design.\\nBut it was producing inconsistent expresso quality and does not extract well in the few days that I used it. It is not a sturdy machine and although nothing has broken and it looks perfect, the green bar light started blinking up and down and then the on button turned red. It had completely stopped powering on by the end of the first week.it leaks even after repeating cleaning process. Probably because I can\\'t get them to send me the rinsing toolI was looking for a low budget coffee latte machine and found this one. It was a good choice I love it you and using it every day!Muy satisfecha con esta compra, superó mis espectativas. Café muy rico y espumoso. Muy práctica porque ocupa muy poco espacio. 100% recomendable.I hate red electrical cord! Why? It doesn’t match anything and is so visible. The design is rounded and therefore it takes more space on the counter. Hot or cold start lever is a bit confusing and could be more user friendly. The taste of the coffee is really good and the possibilities to adjust the size and strength is great.Hate Enormous power tool-like RED cord on a black and stainless small appliance - SO WEIRD\\nI have tried but cannot hide it! Not only is it red and ugly, it is long too........... what in the heck is the reason for this cord?Why why why would any manufacturer put a bright red cord on a silver/black machine??!! This is too much of an eye sore, returned machine.This is the most versatile coffee/espresso machine we have ever used. We replaced separate coffee maker and espresso/latte\\' machines that were getting old and, even after cleaning just didn\\'t produce the flavorful drinks my wife and I enjoy.\\nWe both love the Genio 2. The coffee provided by Nescafe is flavorful and aromatic and, the selections are varied enough for our tastes. Another benefit is the small footprint. This little machine freed up counter space. But, its size may be an issue for some as the water container is also on the small side requiring more frequent fill ups.\\nLastly, since the capsules are not widely available you must get them online. This too may be an issue for some.\\nWe\\'ve had it for 4 months so, would we buy it again? In a heartbeat!I will reach out to Nescafé now, but ours stopped working after 9 mos. we used it to make 2-3 coffees per day. It fails to power on now, simply flickers. Such a shame because we loved it!Estoy muy disgustado compré la cafetera nueva y mira como venía toda sucia, nunca imaginé que recibiría una cafetera en este estado, está llena de café en polvo dentro del empaque, aparte de lo que cayó sobre la mesa. y el piso, pedí una devolución y otra en su lugar espero que mi cafetera salga impecable como tiene que ser.\\nla cafetera se cambió y está funcionando bien y vino en perfectas condiciones, graciasexcellent, prepares a cup of coffee in a matter of secondsPurchased the Genio 2. Very easy to use and the coffee is delicious. Does not take up much space on the counter. I\\'ve only used the Cappuccino pods and yum, love it. I really like the milk pods and don\\'t have to mess with real milk. In fact, I make a cup of regular coffee on my other machine and use the milk pod on the Genio 2 for my husband. He\\'s impressed. At this stage in life, I want the coffee how I want and this is it.Machine showed up today. We made some great coffee this afternoon. Works as advertised. BUT the bright red cord..... a blinking red light would have been less noticeable. Hence the lacking 5th star.My son enjoyed using it as well as his fellow officersDoesn’t work half the timeMuy buen producto pero los Pods son dificil de consequirI love the little room this takes in my NYC apartment. The taste is the delicious as well. Only reason I gave it 4 starts is because the cord is a bright red! So, if you have it on your kitchen counter and your kitchen is any other color than red, it will look out of place. We\\'ve manged to hide the cord behind our kitchen knife set, but still pretty annoying. Besides that, everything\\'s good!I bought this as a gift for my wife and I’m glad I did. I also ordered Cafe Au Lait and Cappuccino both are quite tasty. The machine was easy to use right out of the box.Muy rápida, y fácil de usar,Very easy and straightforward to use, makes a lovely mug of latte.Siempre podes contar con un café profesional hecho en casaMy fiancé’s old one broke and I upgraded her to the this model. It’s awesome for her she brewed a cup and no issue. However, the cord is bright red. That’s the only thing I must complain about this machine, it’s eye soar in the kitchen.Started leaking and now it leaves a big water puddle everytime we make some coffee. Substandard quality!Loved the product but didnt get any samples.The machine is quite straight forward to use. The usage guide provides all the details for first time users. I had one of this before when I used to live over sea so already familiar with it. It is great 👍I love all the ways to make the coffee it’s an adorable sturdy wonderfully cute machine it makes all kinds of different drinks it’s so much fun and everything taste great and get my coffee really quick in the morningGreat coffee machine!I love it. I wanted a smaller coffee \"maker\" but still wanted the espresso/cap capabilities. I got it in this machine. I love the simplicity (a long time ago I had a full-on espresso machine with a milk frother that I couldn\\'t get to work), and I love the ability to change the settings if I choose. I just wish there was a recycling option for the pods. I am purchasing a reusable pod kit, which isn\\'t cheap, to use after I go through the capsules I purchased. I am quite happy with this purchase.excellent I recommend itI bought this machine since I bought it I cannot make it work I already buy two different kinds of coffee and Nancy Nurse to work with that espresso and it was kind of expensive also coffee help me out please it’s not fair\\nCan you refund my money\\nGood morning;\\nI\\'m so surprised that you have not received it yet. I have sent it back to you already. I\\'m going to look for the receipt because I sent it long time ago.\\nWith the original box.\\n\\nMs. VazquezThis is nice. Not sure if it should be the price but overall it\\'s worth it. Just wish you can get more coffee out of the cups you buy. But it\\'s better then having expersso grind everywhere. It\\'s very classy looking to. Every now in then the thing won\\'t come out but I think it gets stick or something. But I do like thisA couple of minutes and you get a nice great cup of coffeeWorks great at blending froth for macchiato\\'s.CoffeeFacilidad de usoI was looking for a quick and inexpensive espresso machine and I found this one. I love how small and space saver it is, it does the job and I didn’t have to break the bank on a high end espresso machine. I’m very happy with this itemGood blend but with the prices you would need to take couple of risk buys i wish the have variant bundleLove the machine. No problems at all. I use distilled water, works best. Would recommend to anyone!I bought this brand because I saw it from a friend. It is excellent if you read the easy to use instructions. I have had no complications with the machine. The drawer that you see at the bottom I bought it separately to put the capsules.Very cute and convenient! I brought two for each of my small offices.The machine is easy enough to use and the coffees taste fine. Unfortunately, I can only find the coffee pods that work with this machine on Amazon. No grocer near me carries these. Also, the capsules make tiny (teeny tiny) cups of coffee. If you want the full flavor you end up with about a 4oz cup of coffee.\\n\\nIf I were a 16 year old kid this would be great. It’s just not the “daily” coffee pot I was hoping for. Wouldn’t buy again.Some people said the coffee was not as hot as they expected. So my first cup I took a big gulp and let\\'s just say it is very, very hot. So easy to use. If you had a professional cappuccino maker you would have to do things perfectly to get as good a cup as this makes. From start to finish, including turning the machine on and heating up, you can make a cappuccino in less than a minute. Love it so far.Easy to use...but espresso not strong enough for the milk\\nIf I want 12oz of coffee then the drink will be weak.Love this compact machine for my office. It’s easy to use!This machine is heaven send!!! One of my happiest purchase for myself ever!! Bringing crabby ole me to sweet and pleasant and tolerable adult haha. The Dulce cappuccino and the latte are incredible!! I\\'m so glad this machine is this affordable to make a cappucino and latte so EASILY!! And lets not forget that it gets delivered right to my doorstep in TWO days!!! Perfection!!The first one we got was delivered with a broken toggle switch. It was replaced with a brand new machine the next day. This machine is easy to use and creates a wonderful drink. We\\'ve had espresso, cappuccino, coffee, and macchiato... all have been great.It\\'s a great productSo good I love this product have them for giftsI just received the coffee machine and have spent 3 hours trying to make a cup of coffee. There\\'s no number to call and I am returning the thing now. I wish I cold throw it out the window.Best coffee maker ever, easy to use and the coffee ☕️ taste is amazing! Highly recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Great single serverwe had a piclolo for years, When it finally broke we got this one. doesn\\'t take up much more space but the water vessel holds more water and was an automatic shut off. Nice upgrades for such a tiny machine, Love the coffee tooMuy buen producto. Hay que saber regular el aguan para el cafe, a veces si sigues las instrucciones de las medidas del agua, puede quedar muy suave el cafe y con poco sabor. Solo hay que ir probando la medidas del aguaI just wish there were more pod options. Honestly, if I had known my pod options were so limited, I would have bought a keurig!I had this when living in England - am happy to find it here in the US>Waiting for the coffee pods looks good.\\nAfter first using, the coffee is wonderful and this machine could be used for hot water~~The cord is red it really stands out should have been blackWish i had brought one that fits the regular size kcups.Me encantoI\\'m satisfied with the coffee machine.\\nI am drinking coffee with my husband every day.\\nIt works well and is easy.\\nand ~ I got a register my machine on the Nescafé website and receive a gift.I purchased the Nescafe Dolce Gusto about 1 1/2 months ago and it is leaking out of the bottom. I have to put a stack of paper towels under it. Where do I get replacement “0” rings?I got this product primarily for lattes and such because I am, frankly, a spoiled brat who refuses to drink utilitarian work coffee, but wanted to cut back on the Starbucks trips. It puts out a decent (though a bit small) product for hot drinks, but I can\\'t seem to get it quite right for iced drinks and I\\'m not sure why. This is a real bummer for summer in Texas.Bought this for my mom after owning the same model for several years. Took a second to learn how to use it, and makes really great quality specialty espresso drinks such as cappuccinos. Great for regular coffee too.This was easy to use and the flavor was wonderful, but it leaked so bad I had to return it, which made me very sad.easy to use, travels beautifully to horse shows. early morning I want my good coffee. This makes each day a joy. won\\'t be with out it!So, I got this coffee maker for my mom who wanted this late last year. My mom fell in love with it. She enjoyed the quality of the coffee. Everything was working fine until the other day. It just died. She was unable to turn it on. She tried plugging it somewhere else and still nothing. It’s unfortunate because it was good, but if their coffee machines are defective something needs to be done.It worked on occassion. Will not buy again! need to returnEasy to use! Can make complex drinks, like latte Macchiatos (in photo). Also works with 3rd party refillable capsules for custom blending !I new that this was an \"open box\" when I purchased it but the listing didn\\'t state that there was a missing item.\\nI had to purchase the rinsing tool from an on-line company that ended costing me $12.00. I could have purchased a new unused machine for that extra price.I\\'ve had 3 pf these machines,different models. The first one stopped working shortly after I received it. The next 2 leaked from day one. I\\'m still waiting to receive the return label and box to teturn it from manufacturer. Guess I have to call again. Will NEVER buy another product of theirs.I love my Nescafé Dolce Gusto. It’s so easy to use and makes amazing espresso drinks at home.I\\'ve bought this item and it is not working. Plugged in, tried to turn it on and literary nothing happened. From outside, it looks brand new and not damaged, but it is not working AT ALL. Very disappointed.\\nI hope this review will not be deleted, since people have to know all odds, before spending this amount of money on non-working coffee machine.No lo he podido probar pq pensé que venia con varios pods de muestra y no fue así, eso lo decía en la reseña del artículo cuando lo compré me decepciono.This little coffee maker works like a big coffee maker. Was in London the beginning of September at my sister inlaws and she had the same coffee maker. That\\'s all they use for making coffee and we were very surprised at how well it worked. Very good coffee. When we got back to the states we ordered one, we are very happy with it. Way better than a Kureg.The various coffee pods available are absolutely delicious! I\\'ve loved my coffee maker since it 1st came out! It\\'s so,so easy to use! Makes amazing different coffees of your choosing! LOVE!Cool product but the fact that you can\\'t buy the pods in stores means I won\\'t be keeping it. Decided to get a Nespresso.Me gusta pero ya paro de trabajarEl producto es excelente y llegó en perfectas condiciones.\\nNo es muy ruidosa lo que hace que sea aún mejor. Es muuuuuy fácil de usar!This coffee maker is amazing. I purchased this for my work office because I was making daily trips to Starbucks. I’m not lazy, I just hate the way K-cups taste and I love my lattes so I will walk right pass our Keurig every morning. Now I am planning on replacing our Keurig for my weekend coffee experience!This coffee maker is what I was looking for. Affordable, good tasting coffee, easy to use and maintain.Great little machine. Had a Keurig and put it away after using this machine. Only machine to get Latte coffee without the hassle of steaming or a separate machine for frothing the milk. Highly recommendIt is easy to use, warmth is good & the variety of coffees to use is great! You can choose how strong your coffee should be or how much milk you want in your latte. Love it!I bought it less than 2months ago. I used it max 20times and it has stopped working. Very disappointed for this price.. and what can i do now out of the return window…FIRST, WHO PUTS A BRIGHT RED CORD ON A MACHINE, WHEN NO ONE WANTS TO HIGHLIGHT A CORD! SECOND, MY OLD MACHINE WAS EASIER TO ADD WATER. THE CONTAINER STOOD UP AND I COULD FILL FROM THE TOP. THE TRAY IS VERY SMALL. I HAD TO SWITCH TRAYS FROM MY OLD MACHINE.File in returnUnit stop working after purchasing item less then 5 months old, unit stop working, no reset option available. unable to reach manufacture for product support or product replacement, Amazon rep is now involved.Very goodPros: This a great coffee maker. It delivers great flavor coffee\\nIt takes up less room in my counter than my other machine\\nCon: this is my 2nd machine in two weeks\\nThe first machine leaked water from day one out of the bottom of the machine\\nAmazon sent a replacement and it works great No LeaksMuy practica. Tiene sabores exquisitos. Pero trae un cordón a la corriente rojo que hay que esconderla.This product does what it says it’s going to do I am in espresso maniac in this stuff comes out in one minute and the milk pods make great froth it is perfect!Leaking after only a few usesGreat! The pods can get stuck, so be sure to leave the pod holder removed after use. Otherwise, perfect.La compre\\nCon mucha ilusión pero llego que no funcionaba y lo peor es que, por un retraso en la entrega me llegó fuera de l devolución y perdí mi dinero. Ya probaremos con otra.\\nEsta no sirvióLike how easy isThis is my second Genio. An easy 2 step process makes great cappuccino, lattes, chai tea, even hot chocolate. Also 1 step basic coffee in many types. Quick and easy with excellent results.It’s a good coffee makerafter a few uses it already has problems, it doesn\\'t always work to make hot coffee, it only starts with the cold one, sometimes I put the milk capsules and the water flows from the top of the machineThis is is awesome. I’ve made cappuccino and espresso and so so easy and simple to use !!!\\nHighly recommend it if u like this...perfect size and water chamber is fairly sized. Real Cool looking too 😎.Item as described & fast shippingLove the machine… but a fire engine red cord????I just love this coffee machine especially if u use the original pods ohh my no more Starbucks for me ❤️Was excited about this from other reviews but the coffee has a taste that takes some getting used to and other ones taste watery. I’ve tried the espresso, the cappuccino and the Starbucks americano. I go through too many pods and have had much better cups of coffee.Play VideoThe product is great, easy to use, the water deposit it is a little uncomfortable to fill, but you get use to it.Easy to used and the brew is surprisingly good. Enjoying it a lot.I\\'ve had several different types of coffee makers and this is the best of all. Very easy to use, doesn\\'t take up a lot of space on the counter, fast to heat-up and very very easy to keep clean and refill. love it.So the product was great work fine but it didn’t come with any other pods as advertised we were expecting to get everything in one but overall great productFast and easy!Muy bueno al principio al mes ya no quería encender no se por que pero muy bueno muestras funcionoNo funciona, el vendedor no responde, no recomiendo el producto, para tener 5 meses debería funcionar, he tratado de ponerme en contacto con el vendedor y no he podido 😞Optimo producto vale la pena. Solo que el cesto para cápsulas usadas debiera estar inserido en la máquina no afuera, sería mas cómodo todo colegado automático y mas estetico. Gracias.I am sure it is not a reflection on the product when it works, but the item I received did not work. The water did not heat and ran all over the place but in the cup.Easy to use, it\\'s small, but, it\\'s hard to find the coffee. The coffee with flavors don\\'t have much flavor and again they are hard to find!I love this Coffee Machine and the Nescafe customer service is the best customer service that I have been in touch with all my life. I am Brazilian by birth and coffee in one of our traditions. This machine makes the best coffee ever. I will never try a different one!!!!This coffee machine is wonderful and makes my life so much easier in the mornings. It takes 3 mins max to make a coffee. Perfect temperatureI have already known the machine but the one that I received has a pump damage and if I do not take off the water reserve after each use, water goes everywhere in the countertop. There is such a lickingIt has been approx a month and i am happy to say its working wonderfully and tried two flavours so far and love themIt’s great everything it shows is really true. I really liked the productEasy to make and it is a small coffee makerMakes great espresso and cappuccino but these machines do not last long. One lasted just a year, others 2 or 3.Wonderful...we use is a few times a week....fits right on my small counterI had tasted a friends Nescafe pod coffee (with a more expensive espresso/coffee machine) and had great expectations for this machine. The machine works well, however, I found that it took 2 coffee pods to make a single cup of coffee which makes this quite a bit more expensive per cup. I was also disappointed in the taste of the coffee (I tried about 12 different Dulce Gusto pods). So, this maker has been put in storage and I am back using my machine that grinds means fresh and makes drip coffee.I’m glad I decided to purchase the Doluce Gusto!La\\nMejor inversión lo recomiendoLove itI\\'ve had it for almost exactly 1 year and it has stopped working. Really disappointing. Good luck with the warranty as well. Their \"24/7 phone support\" sends you straight to voicemail.Great machine amazing coffee will buy againWe use it for cappuccino and lattes, tasted just like the ones from Starbucks.Very nice coffe machine!\\nNescafe need only to improve the coffe flavor ...Very easy to follow instructions, fresh cup every time.I’m not even using it. It’s not even what I thought!!Does what it says. Easy and great taste.Me gusta muchoThis machine is so easy to use and keep clean. I love it!An amazing machine effortless cleaningNice in between while looking for a traditional machine.\\nVery easy to use...Available coffee products are goodVery easy to use but the coffee cups are hard to findI purchased this in March and now it\\'s leaking water and coffee on the side of the machine . I can\\'t even make a coffee .I try to return it but I guess it\\'s too late? Since it\\'s been over a month.This Genio 2 replaced a Genio 1 that died after a long life ... this one has a fancier switch at the top (rubber pad, electronic) that has, I suspect, died. Anyway, the coffee machine, which is great when working, is no longer working after 6 months, which isn\\'t good enough for something that cost over $100. In general, the 2 does seem a bit tackier and less solidly made than the 1 verison.It is my first time using Nescafe coffee maker and it is extraordinary!Works great!\\nLove it and the pods are less expensive.Play Video\\n Se le escapa el agua por el reservorio, parece desperfecto de fabrica.GreatLove the updated product!Recipient was excited to get the machine and loves it!Good productNoThis coffee maker is amazing.Play Video\\n My machine was used. Now what?Pods produce small cups, and if you try to make a grande with just one pod it will be very diluted. It might take 3-4 pods for a grande, depending on flavor.Great espresso and coffeeEasy to useDisappointed. Lasted 10 months under minimum use. First unit lasted 2 years.This is my favorite Coffee machine to use. The coffees are delicious. The pods are a little hard to find but Amazon usually has them.\\n\\n.Love this! Look forward to having my coffee every morning!!This machine is ok I should order a better one.It was delicious!!Ease in using the machine...Works great coffee is awesomeI like it its goodThe coffee maker has become dysfunctional because the coffee pod bursts as soon as you put it inside the maker. It broke in less than a year and there is no way that one can contact the seller and try to fix the problem even though I have been trying for the last two months.Just received my replacement and guess what? It has dirt and sand and scratches all over. It\\'s clearly used. And it doesn\\'t even turn on. How are you people in business? 4th unit I have purchased because I love them. Of you want a coffee maker that\\'s amazing but literally will not last more than a year buy their products. I have owned the most expensive and the cheapest and every one like clock work die within a year. Currently my machine is doing everything except sucking up the water, which is what my last one did also. .makes all the noises but doesn\\'t make the coffee. It\\'s so Incredibly frustrating.Best machine and coffee ever!!! And easy to useThis puts out more frothy milk than my last one!I like too much the flavor, love itBest coffee machine ever!I love it!Love having the different choices of espresso.I have had a couple different versions of this model over the past 10+ years. These used to make the best coffee. However, I just ordered a new one, and it is not the same. The machine is no longer pressurized and the coffee is weak and terrible! It was so bad that assumed I received a defective machine, so I ordered a replacement. The replacement is the same - no pressure! Sadly, I will be looking for a new coffee machine.Love it.Best product everLove the flavor of the coffee and easy to use.n/aAmazingGood product but difficult to get the pods. When they do come in they are great tasting!So much better tasting and flavorful than Keurig machine coffee. Highly recommend!Loved the product for making coffee. The on off switch quit working after about 10 months. NO response from the company to my written and telephone messages requesting warranty service.ColorcoffeeI love how it looks and the coffee flavor. But the quality of the product is not great. They don’t last much. I bought two Of them last year, for two different houses, and I need to replace them both now.Works greatAfter less than 5 months this low quality piece of garbage made in CHINA leaked all over my wooden table and ruined it!!! Definitely do not purchase!!!Great tasting coffee! Was hesitant but glad I did. Best home brew.ExelenteDe lo mejor fácil de usar encantada con la compra que hiceLove it!Súper fácil de usar. Varios sabores disponibles, incluso de chocolates.First machine I ordered wouldn’t dispense coffee. After going through every possible solution with customer service, they advised me to exchange the machine. Amazon wouldn’t exchange it at first, giving me a hard time about it even though it was clearly a defective machine bought from them. Once I was finally able to get the replacement (weeks later), went to try this one out, put water in the tank, only to have it leak directly out of the seams in the bottom and all over the counter. Too many issues with this machine for the price. I returned the second one and will be sticking with my Keurig.Lo fácil de operarI loved my coffe machine, the coffe is really good, so creamy and smooth and make a lot of foam. It’s nice machineI love this coffee express machine! Easy to use and clean. Makes express or up to 12 oz coffee with foam!The product never worked. The water would not pump through the tube. I called the 800 number for Nescafé and was told to go to Website and receive assistance because a lot of people are having the same issue. I still have not heard back from them. Plus…the red cord is hideous. I just threw it in the trash!!!!Excellent coffee machine!!\\nThis is my third one, but I love the newest version the most.\\nVery easy to make tasteful coffee.Delicious European coffee taste such as Latte, Capuccino, and \\'cafe au lait\\' (from my youth)easy to use. We love itEl equipo es de color silver y negro y el cable de alimentación eléctrico es de color rojo tomate.\\nDesafortunadamente en las fotos que tienen puesta no se ve el cable de la cafetera, de haberla visto con el cable de color rojo tomate no la hubiese comprado.\\nPues nada tiene que ver el equipo con ese cable de alimentación eléctrico rojo.\\nOtra opinión cuando tienes el equipo en las no se ve nada fuerte y duradero, el depósito del agua no encaja bien y el soporte donde se pone la jarra a la hora de hacer el café queda flojo.\\nEstas son mis razones por la que estoy devolviendo mi pedido.\\nA mi gusto se ve horrible en ni cocina, parece algo de juguete.\\nDe cualquier manera siempre agradezco a Amazon su formalidad, su eficiencia y su garantía de entrega!La cafetera ha dejado de funcionar con tan sólo 2 semanas de uso.Fue un regalo en Enero de 2022 y el día 6 de febrero dejo de funcionar, ni tan siquiera enciende. Muy mala opinión de su calidadIt is not hot that muchI love the cappuccinos and this machine makes the best!!.... I really like all their coffees....I’ve had two of these, and both encountered a problem where it just quits turning on. I bought the second one here on Amazon and it worked great for about two months and then quit turning on. The machine Makes coffee way better than a Keurig as far as taste goes, but definitely does not have the lasting power of one. And the dolce gusto pods are expensive. I won’t be buying another one.Dislike red power cordThis machine does not functionMakes very good coffee. Coffee comes out at perfect drinking temperature. Flavor depends on what coffee you use.Worst costumer service ever. I love my Genio 2 machine, but unfortunately I broke my capsules holder. I asked for a replacement part and they said that they don’t have replacement parts and since that I have warranty for 2 years I asked for a new machine because I only used mine for few months. Every time I contact them they apologize for the late response and say that they will check the warranty department and let me know and nothing happened till now.I would like a full refund, this product I could not get pods for coffee for months. I do not like it.I love how small it is. Makes great coffee too!Like the look, simplicity ...taste of coffee and variety drinks can be done with this coffee maker.Mi electrodoméstico favoritoWas unable to open tray, found a generic filter was jamed inside tray. I was able to fix it but the seller new it was jammed up and sold it as a working product. I ordered one that was listed as new and had no problems with that one.Amazing machineIt was a gift. My son likes it. I haven\\'t used it, so I can\\'t review other than that.no complaints . works great.would buy againOverall it’s a okay machine. Definitely not worth over $100, hot is fine but whenever I use cold it taste way different, there isn’t many flavors, and I have to continue to put a lot of water. So far not really impressedNo es buena maquinaCoffee is weak. Coffee maker does not have a consistent pours or flavor.Great cappuccinos and espressos - no other capsule coffee machine can do them as well.Machine will not turn on after 3 months......Certainly not worth the money if it only works for 3 months. Did make great coffee- very disappointing.Excellent.This is a piece of junk compared to the first models. The brewing noise alone should tell you it is cheaply made . I’ll keep my three year old model and descale it.It worked really fine until the 6th month, then stopped turning on - died completely. It\\'s a shame that it does not last I really liked it.Recommended!!! Easy to use for 1-2 people. Love cappuccino pods. The best!!!LovedSuper buenaIt’s loud, takes long to start and it’s a waste on pods once you can only use a bit of it.Good machine and easy to use & cleanLove it! Great for a dorm! Amazing coffee!It works fine so far for six weeks.i PURCHASED ORIGINAL UNIT ABOUT 1 1/2 YEARS AGO. iT WORKED FINE UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN IT STARTED POURING WATER EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE CUP. I determined that the unit was no longer piercing the coffee capsule. Since it was fine for a year and a half and was no longer under warranty I purchased a new one. Identical problem. poor manufacturing and obviously no quality control.My coffee maker is not working, no water comes out and water is leaking underneath.This product never worked. I am in the process of returning it. I was very dissatisfied. Now I am stuck with two cases of pods and nothing to use them inEasy to use, I love this machine!I bought this and have yet to use. The cups listed as usable WITH product do not fit.\\nI bought three different kinds.\\nNone fit.\\nLooks good, but may be sending back.Just as expected same as Starbucks qualityI’ve had this machine since December 17 and today is March 7 and it is broken!Does not make a strong cup of coffeeGreat coffee maker. Makes specialty coffee’s at home that are amazing!Spit coffee all over bad machine!!+Instructions not at all friendly for first time buyers. At the bottom of the page where I ordered it I ordered coffee pods that where suppose to be compatible and their not. Thru the machine into recycling. Get a universal pod machine.We loved it, easy, simple and tasty!!!I love the coffee maker, nice and convenient!!!!Awesome, great taste, easy to use.goodThe machine works fine, but the issue is capsule. First, they are expensive. Second, the price can not be under the control. We started to buy 23$ per box but then the prices raised to 34 $. It is a trap. Third, the taste is not very pleasant and sub-optimal. I would not recommend to buy this machine or any of the capsules.I likedI used the product just for one type of flavor it ok not the best. I regret buying it to be honest. And there is a issue with the machine and not sure what to do I can’t return it. I’m not able to reach out to someone for technical helpAbsolutely love this coffee machine!We loved itBest EverFirst one I bought wouldn’t stay on and wouldn’t allow me to select the once’s I wanted to make I returned it. The turn around time was really fast,I’m thinking 48 hours. The second one wouldn’t let me select the ounces either,so I was having to turn it back on again and again. I wasn’t trying a third timeI LIKE THIS VERY GOOOOOOD!!!Great product for good coffeeWe had an older model of this machine that lasted us 8 years . In 3 months we\\'ve purchased 2 of these and they both stoped working for no apparent reason the button that turn on stilts working. Complete garbage and moneyThank you for your supportthis is a joke, this machine will not dispence a cup of coffee. it goes on the counter, instead of in the cup. never got the cleaning tool that comes with it.I believe The machine is okay if what I received was anything close to acceptable. I received a super dirty one with some parts missing. a waste of my time and had to arrange the return. disappointing experience.The flavors available are not as good as other brands\\nVery easy to useWhat a mess! I only used it 3 times. It leaks all over the counter. The pod tray keeps getting stuck. It\\'s going back!If you are a coffee aficionado this is not for you. The Powdered substance in the capsules are disgusting.Easy use,Rhe best coffe machineNo instruction in boxSolid unit.I tried the pods that went with this machine and the flavors were nasty. Mine espresso machine does way better. Do not like the coffee taste that comes from this machine I returned itthank youI’m doesn’t work please resend as promised this item is not truing on, just opened and it\\'s not working.\\n\\nAnd I can\\'t send this trash back to the seller, because I\\'m not in the USExcellentAfter only six months the coffee maker leaks all the water out. I have to put a towel underneath.Bought it july 27 got broken today got still red light. machine stop working less than 2 monthsDidn’t work for me! I wanted to use reusable pods and I tried the plastic and steel ones but the results weren’t consistent with either. I ended up buying a Nespresso Vertuo Next, let’s hope reusable pods work better with that one.I had mine for 4 years, still works great. But I only use it a few times a week when I want a specialty coffee. Probably not the best for everyday use if you drink a lot of coffee: water tank doesn\\'t hold enough water and it is awkward shaped to set correctly on the water intake valve.\\n\\nVery easy to use and starts up very fast (although a little loud, makes a buzzing pump sound).\\n\\nYou can make your coffee as strong or weak as you like. You can use the same \"flavor\" pod and get 2 different coffee drinks. You can use the strong (less water) setting and make espresso-ish drink with crema coffee foam or use a lighter (more water) setting make coffee....it\\'s versatile to your coffee taste.\\n\\nPods are a little expensive but saves me money from buying espresso drinks from coffee shops. There are enough different pod style and flavors out there (not at stores but online) to find what \\'s right for you.\\nPods seem to stay fresh at room temperature for months too.\\n\\nOnly issue I have is the drinks are not hot enough, so I usually pre heat/rinse my cup with hot tap water before. My sister has one also, she had a clogged water dispense nozzle that she cleared with a needle (she believes the water in her area has too much minerals in it). She switched to filtered water and hasn\\'t had anymore issues.la maquiña la acabo de abrir y me llego dañadaBroken within a few months.BuenísimoCaffeeI loved this machine. The coffee was great but over time began tasting watery and it completely stopped working after about a yearMuy buen cafeThis is our second one after the change. It worked fine for about 1 month then started to leak. After viewing it again online we discovered that behind the unit and in between it and the water tank there is hidden a pin used to clean the spout where the coffee is sprayed from. So far after a few uses it’s working without leaking. But why did the manufacturers use a red cord instead of the old black one ? And I wish that there was some kind of a cleaning brush for the water tank.I have did everything to trouble shooting this. Machine does not work I am so Mad because I was looking forward to have exspresso every day I would like a refund thank you tylerWe thought it was really cool, but the capsules are not sold ANYWHERE. They\\'re expensive on here too. So we gave it away.Gross.....first machine showed up and was used and missing parts! So gross!!! Second machine I received fast once I complained, but returned. Barley works, pods are expensive and not very flavorful. Returned it right away! Don’t recommend at allShame for such brand to ship used products with missing parts! Box was clearly opened! Adjustable tray and bucket for used pods are missing... Machine itself works just fine.Didn\\'t realize PODS, or whatever there called are so expensive. You can buy refillable ones, and use your own coffee, but reviews say hard to clean machine afterwards. Saves && but not convenientIt wasn’t what I expected.Waste of time and money tried a few different pods flavors no taste definitely not coffee El Artículo llegó en pésimo pésimo estado. Llego sucio, con una cápsula aún en la cafetera y no funciona al 100% por favor tomar en cuenta antes de comprarlo. Envían cafeteras usadas.Meh. I wanted to love this. I really really did!! But it just doesn’t have the flavor. It has such a watery tasteIt just stopped working in less than a year.\\nI should put my money in something more valuable.My Dolce Gusto Coffe machine stopped working, I bought it on July 4 2020, and is broken in less than a year :(Coffee is luke warm. Very disappointed. Also the link in the included paperwork to coffee drink recipes doesnt work.I am on my second machine. The first one lasted over 2 years but the second genio 2 lasted me 7 months. It died suddenly and will not turn on. Hoping Amazon or Dolce Gusto can help with it.\\nI really liked the coffee though.I bought it for a cristmas present , didnt get to use it till jan 3rd. Great coffee. The reason for 1 star . And i wll change if it gets fixed. No water comes out. Read directions used cleaning needle. But it smoke when turned on no water.I know it says 15 bars but it\\'s not. I\\'ve owned an older Dolce Gusto model and a Nespresso Vertuoline with 15 bars that made fantastic coffee. This model made no crema and the coffee was so weak I now have a caffeine headache.The product came broken and the box was really beat up, very disappointedFresh out the box as a Christmas gift this machine did not work. Seemed like the pump did not work. No water was pumped out of tank into machine. I returned it. Customer service rep on phone was of no help.This expresso maker leaks horribly after a month. Another brand lasted for years. So disappointed!I have to return the coffee machine because the water is flowing outOkay so first of all, I am a huge coffee person. I have several machines at home and I keep a K-cup brewer and Nespresso vertuo machine at work. However, I was interested in finding a machine that could make lattes and cappuccinos using pods instead of steamer wands. So that\\'s when I found the Dulce Gusto.\\n\\nWhen I first got this machine, I only had the regular macchiato pods to use. I followed the recommendations for how long to brew each pod, and I have to admit, my initial impression was underwhelming. There just wasn\\'t much flavor at all. I had to add -extra- espresso from my Nespresso machine just to make it taste good. But, before writing the machine off, I decided to order another variety to see if I liked it any better...\\n\\nWhat I discovered was two things - first, I noticed the packaging on the other varieties I ordered was different than the macchiato box that I had. Upon close inspection, it seems that the macchiato box may have been counterfeit. It just felt and looked cheaper than the other boxes. Additionally, I had a new macchiato box that came with the variety pack and the packaging was different. So I did a blind taste test to see if I could tell a difference between the two macchiatos - and sure enough, the new box tasted different and better. So.... the poor flavor was not the fault of the machine. It was the pods I was using.\\n\\nSince then, every pod I have ordered and used tastes great. I have also bought an adapter from Amazon that allows me to use OL Nespresso pods and that works good too. It allows me to have more options than just using Dulce Gusto pods. I also recommend buying extra milk pods so you can mix and match espresso with milk, without having to buy a combination box. There are third party milk pods that are sold here on Amazon and they taste really good, good price too. Just my suggestion. :)\\n\\nAnyways, yes, this machine is great. Especially now that I have my OL Nespresso adapter. Just make sure when you are ordering pods that you check the reviews because you may wind up with a dud like I did.The machine quit 2 weeks after buying it. Too expensive $$$$ for it to quit, now trying to figure outCoffee was great and pot was very easy to use, but it only lasted 10 months. It makes me sick since I have all these pods that are not compatible with any other coffee maker.Ok so originally I loved this machine. It makes great tasting coffee and relatively easy use. The down sides are that almost within first few months it started having some issues but I was able to deal with them by descaling (using their manual as a guide) and it would be begin working again, but not for long. To make a long story short this thing ends up with many problems and there is no permanent fix. I even called the helpline and they said there was nothing they can do that the machines eventually break with no fix ( of course right after warranty expires 2 years) 2 years and with having to troubleshoot a lot not worth the money or having tasty coffee options. Oh and also pucks are expensive and often the ones you want are not available.The product is damaged and is not workingusefulnessThis machine uses the newest version of pods. It’s cheap to get the older pods from places like Peet’s coffee.\\nI sent it back.Very good coffee but disappointed in the availability of the coffee and the price.Do NOT busy THIS. it only requires its own pods that are so expensive. I need to return it ASAP. Very disappointedThe injector needle is clogged and I have to buy I new one. I used the unclogging tool and it couldn’t do anything but bend. It’s completely not usablehandle broke just a few days after return window closed, would not recommend, cheap product, coffee brews luke warmHad to return it . Was not working properlyThe package was damagedLeaks bought in JanuaryBroke after three months useBuy something else. Bad, bad choiceeasy to use fast but didn\\'t last and no way to get a new replacement.No commentdolce gustomy machine cannot switched on\\nWhat should I do now?? 😭😭\\nPlease help myno funcionóleakingVery easy and convenient to use.Buenas tardes\\nme figura ENTREGADO el pedido,pero no ha llegado a CULVER STOCKTON COLLEGEMy machine suddenly short-circuited after two weeks of use.Using the Nescafé\\'s espresso and milk pod system, it brews very nice lattes and hot chocolates. The Missus is especially partial to the Chai lattes due to the creamy milk pods. This machine is ready to brew in 30 seconds after hitting the power switch which is great when you\\'re running late. Take Note: This machine does not take standard K-cups!Horrible tasteI definitely wasted my money buying this machine. This is a discontinued machine and it\\'s close to impossible to find pods for this! No stores sell them and Amazon sells the pods for extreme high prices. From when I have used it, it makes great lattes and hot cocoa. Only used for a couple of months before I got tired of looking and paying high prices for the podsMachine makes great coffee. However the cost of Dolce Gusto coffees are very high cost wise! Now I am experimenting with making coffee with a reusable Capsules and other coffees and creamersBought this item at the Cyber Monday deal which is very cost effective. The coffee machine is just great!Me encanta, muy fácil y versátil, sobre todo la opción de comprar cápsulas reutilizables para preparar otros productos que no dependan de la marca como café Santo Domingo Decaf.• easy to operate\\n• sleek\\n• loved the little coffee pods bin\\n• stylish!❤What a nifty machine! It makes so many great coffee drinks. My only complaint is the bright orange cord that seems kind of random.Like it alot but had to purchase extra equipment for the different podsThere are so many things I love about this little coffee maker.\\n\\nFirst of all it heats up quicker than any other single serving maker I\\'ve ever used and I\\'ve had quite a few. Less than a minute and it\\'s ready to go.\\n\\nThe machine takes up very little space on the counter top. It\\'s skinny, only about 6 inches wide, the depth is about 10 inches from front to back. Fits perfectly on my small counter top.\\n\\nIt comes with a little container that sits nestled up against the maker when you want to quickly dispose of the pods. Inside the basket is a drip basket above the base so you can remove the pods separately from the liquid, a great no mess touch. It takes a a little more space on the counter but I find it to be very useful and don\\'t always need to keep it there all of the time because it\\'s entirely separate.\\n\\nLoading the water is super easy, you remove the tank in the back and fill, then slide right back in. ( I had read in some earlier reviews that this was difficult for some people, I have to guess that the company improved the design since then because it\\'s very easy now.)\\n\\nThe variety of coffee offerings is great. I\\'ve tried quite a few.\\nMy favorite are some of the two pod varieties. These drinks come with a cream pod and then you discard it and place the darker coffee pod in. Best in this category are: Cappuccino, Latte Macchiato (Vanilla Flavor), and Mocha. The Skinny Cappuccino taste much weaker in flavor but is okay and the regular Latte Macchiato is not to my pleasing.\\nAll of the non cream pod coffee has been very tasty. I enjoy the Dark Roast, Espresso Intenso, Grande Intenso, Medium Roast, and Americano. It all just depends on the mood I\\'m in, but usually I go for the most powerful darker coffees ( Dark Roast and Espresso Intenso).\\nAlso I like the Cafe Au Lait. This is a single pod drink but has it\\'s own foam that comes from that pod, it\\'s like a light version of the some of the two pod drinks, delicious.\\n\\nIt\\'s a nice feature of the machine to have both hot and cold as an option. I only use the hot because I prefer hot coffee. I tried the cold once and it wasn\\'t that cold, of course you need to add ice to make it a proper cold drink.\\n\\nIf there has to be a con, it\\'s that with so many flavors I like it\\'s very difficult to find storage to hold them all. The pods take up a fair amount of space and it\\'s a little challenging to find a way to keep them organized and at the ready in a smaller kitchen space.\\n\\nThe programing of the intensity of the drink is very easy to use. It lets you decide how much water to coffee ratio you want. The top of the machine has a joystick like lever that you control the green lights of amount of liquid to come into the cup. All of the pods come with directions of how many lights to light up but you can tinker with that to your own pleasing.\\n\\nOverall I find that the Nescafe machine is a great coffee maker for single serving counter top. I used to use a Keurig before this and although there are more coffee pod options out on the market I feel like they don\\'t taste as good and don\\'t have the options for the foamy cream drinks. Also the super quick warm up time is super key, if your in need of coffee first thing in the morning and need coffee to have energy to make coffee this little machine goes to work almost instantly.After reading some reviews claiming that the Capsules/Pods would be phased out, I was skeptical of making the purchase. However, I have had no problem acquiring them and have found that the variations of flavors enables me to make more use of this machine than my previous Keurig machine. I have been using this machine daily for 3-4 different beverages and have only once encountered a problem, which I believe was my error. I believe I did not have the pod seated properly with the pod drawer fully closed, which caused the liquid to spray out and miss the cup. Again - I believe this was my error. I appreciate how fast this machine creates whatever beverage I want to make. I brew the standard 12oz coffee as well as hot chocolate, lattes, and cappuccinos. I LOVE LOVE LOVE them all and have a subscription to feed my need :-). I have given the brewed coffee to guests and they immediately went on to purchase their own machine. If you\\'re looking for a good, reliable machine that offers reasonably priced beverages with a good variety of flavors...this is the one to buy. Also note - the price is right compared to other machines.La máquina llegon en perfectas condiciones, todo de acuerdo a lo descritoI like this product, but it doesn\\'t froth as expected. The quality is good. The coffee is good. Great for travelers.\\nI gave it 4 stars.\\nSantaHola, adquirí la máquina recientemente desde el primer uso no he podido lograr que funcione, no ha salido agua nunca, seguí los pasos del manual y no lo logré, suena como si estuviese funcionando pero no logra salir el agua!Best coffee maker we have boughtI am very satisfied with my NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto Coffee Machine! I love it so much I plan to order a second one to gift to my favorite cappuccino loving family member. Here\\'s a quick breakdown:\\n\\nPROS:\\n*Super (super) fast! My drinks were ready in a few seconds. The faster I\\'ve ever seen.\\n*Very easy to use. The toggle tool is awesome - all you have to do is toggle left or right for hot or cold.\\n*Small profile. I have a different brand\\'s cappuccino maker and it is huge and takes up a ton of counter space. This one is so much smaller! It is small enough for desks at work.\\n*A great variety of coffee pods that are flavored and do not need anything added - no sugar, creamer, or syrup. They taste ready to drink right away.\\n*Simple instructions for using the pods - even a child could do it.\\n*I also love the way you can easily change the cup holder to higher or lower levels to avoid splashing coffee.\\n\\nCONS:\\n*The cups the fancy drinks make are small - much smaller than a size I would usually drink. You can do a plain coffee in a 12 oz cup though.\\n*The coffee maker is not tall enough to fit any of my thermal coffee mugs (which makes sense since they don\\'t pour enough coffee for thermal mugs). But, it was disappointing.\\n*The boxes of pods for the fancy drinks say 16, but that actually means 8 of the espresso part and 8 of the milk part = 8 cups per box.\\n*It is delicious, but it is not Starbucks.My husband and I are big coffee drinkers; we grind beans fresh every morning for our breakfast pot. However, I often start lagging in the late afternoon and crave an extra single cup of coffee. I\\'m usually too lazy to deal with the mess of prepping another pot, so I jumped at the chance to try out this Genio 2 unit. The simplicity is very attractive; it has honestly exceeded my expectations. For starters, the unit is very compact; my husband didn\\'t want another appliance taking up space in our tight kitchen, and the Genio 2 fits easily in our dining room (it is approximately 12\" height, 6\" wide, 11\" depth). Next, the coffee actually tastes GOOD. The capsule boxes display a chart to guide the water levels, but one can adjust levels for any preference (e.g., the medium and dark roast capsules recommend 12 oz water, but I brew them on 8 oz for stronger flavor). The water heat-up is quick, brew speed is fast, and drink temperatures are hot.\\n\\nI am impressed with the crema produced on regular coffee brews (note pics); the pressure system on this machine seems to be spot-on. A minor criticism involves the water reservoir; the opening to add water is a semi-circular shape. While it is easy to add water, cleaning it requires a bottle brush because a hand won\\'t fit inside. Another criticism relates to the brewing ounce markers on the front; why are only 10 and 12-oz labeled? There is a sticker that comes with the packaging that shows where 2-, 4-, and 8-oz are; it would be handy to see this on the unit itself. Finally, why is the power cord red? It\\'s not a big deal for me, as I currently have the machine on a table where the cord plugs out of sight. However, if I were to use this in my kitchen, the heavy red cord would be very visible, as my outlets are several inches above my countertops.\\n\\nOverall, my minor criticisms are are not grievous enough to deduct a star because I am really enjoying this unit. It makes a great cup of regular coffee, it\\'s fun to have occasional fancier drinks like lattes and macchiatos, and my children love the chococino hot chocolate. It\\'s also handy for making quick drinks for guests.We had one of the original Dolce Gusto machines several years ago and loved it. It died after two years and we moved on to Kuerig and then a very, very expensive super automatic espresso machine that I\\'ve loved for the last two years. My husband gets easily aggravated by the espresso machine and I dislike most of the Kcup coffees. So trying this new generation Dolce Gusto was a no brainer.\\n\\nThis machine is very quiet - significantly less noisy than the espresso machine grinding beans at 7am and quieter than the Kuerig even. This Genio also takes half the counter space of either of the other two machines. My husband appreciates the simplicity of the Genio - just pop in the pod, adjust the toggle to the strength you want and press start. It\\'s exactly that simple for both black coffee and cappuccino or an iced mocha. The milk pods froth and foam very nicely.\\n\\nWe have tried six different coffee versions so far and I have to say that I had forgotten how good the Dolce Gusto coffees really are. There has been absolutely no bitterness or aftertaste or oily residue from any one of them at all. My husband really likes the plain Americano and Intenso black coffees.\\n\\nI\\'m particularly fond of the simple cappuccino, vanilla latte machiatto and the cafe aulait. The caramel latte is a shade too sweet for me, but my mother loves it. However, the one thing every one of us is crazy about is the mocha over ice. Fill a regular plastic cup with crushed ice and a straw, set the machine for 12 ounces, add a bit of sugar to taste, and brew the hot water option. It\\'s like a chocolate milk shake, just not as thick. Makes a great after dinner, sitting on the porch with the dogs, desert coffee. This is what I’ve been looking for...I used to LOVE using a Tassimo machine that was similar to this but the Tassimo stopped having coffee readily available and it was a huge bummer. This machine definitely picks up where that left off years ago and is WAY more economical for lattes, cappuccino, espresso, etc, than any machine I’ve used before. Also, the milk pods are a sort of powdered version but I cannot tell at all when enjoying morning coffee. This Dolce Gusto is simple to use, has a great reservoir size and while it has somewhat different directions than I’m used to, it gives me the ability to ramp up or ramp down either coffee or milk. Essentially, the bars is how much of each you are wanting to make and the pictures on the top of the pods correlate to the amount for each. I learned to tweak the amount of coffee and milk and it has produced some outstanding results and placed me firmly into coffee bliss.\\n\\nCoffee:\\n\\nThis has a LOT of coffee types available. I know there is at least 13 kinds, not counting dessert drinks. Lattes, cappuccino, macchiato, espresso, Americano, to name a few. There is also a decaf version. Basically, I’m loving the options.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nWorks very well\\n\\nBrews a mean espresso, latte, macchiato, Americano\\n\\nMilk is powdered but keeps way longer\\n\\nPods are economical (opinion)\\n\\nGives ability to tailor the amount of mil/espresso as desired (isn’t in the directions, however)\\n\\nHeats up way faster than my Keurig\\n\\nDoes hot and cold\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nCan’t run just water unless you use the clear adapter (no issues but the adapter looks like packing material)\\n\\nI’ve not seen pods for it in a lot of stores (so here is probably the best place to get them)\\n\\nOverall, this has usurped my Keurig and Nespresso for my morning wake up routine.Good luck getting the pods for these machines. Had one, loved it but the pods were coming from obscure place in Britain and only received half of what I ordered. Emailed to complain to Nescafé and got no response. Better off going with Another brand.I never thought I would ever like coffee. I ordered this for my husband because he is a coffee fanatic. As I was making his cup I really liked how good it smelled so I decided to take a sip. Well that sip led to another and then another and suddenly I\\'m hooked and there are so many different flavors available that I\\'m not sure if I\\'ll ever get to all of them. I know some might think that the coffee pods are too expensive but that can not be further from the truth. These come out to be around $.70 per pod. And, with the pods, the coffee will be the exact amount and strength you want every time. On each pod there is a picture of a bar level. All that has to be done is to match the bars on the pod lid to the machine and then choose whether you want it hot or cold. Now the bar levels act as a template so it gives a pretty good estimate as to what that particular flavor should be brewed at but you can certainly adjust the bar level to whatever you want. The flavors that have those yummy creamy foams will be just as perfect as if you were getting it from one of those expensive coffee houses. I know all this bar stuff sounds confusing but once you purchase this and read the instructions it will be so easy to understand. The instruction manual is very detailed and easy to follow. It takes no time at all to brew a cup so no more waiting for that regular old coffee maker to get done. This is shaped like one of those bullet blenders so it doesn\\'t take up much counter space. For all that this machine can do, it is worth every penny. And again, I have to say this, the coffee that comes out of this no matter if it\\'s dark roast, cappuccino, or one of the many other flavors, it will taste utterly flawless!Don\\'t get me wrong, this is kind of an amazing product in some ways. Simply amazing...in some ways. For one, while it is definitely a substantial piece of equipment it is not Mongo. I hate Mongo appliances as they take up way more space than they should and in doing so make themselves completely annoying when not in use.\\nSecond, it looks cool. When I described it to someone as looking like Atom Ant that person began to laugh, but it really does look like a 21st century Atom Ant.\\nThird, it is stupidly easy to operate. In fact, it is so stupidly easy to operate that even the sometimes stupid instructions don\\'t really matter (more on that later).\\nFourth, the stuff it makes really does mostly look exactly like the pictures and you know that never happens.\\nFifth, it makes NO MESS (but it do create lots of waste).\\nDon\\'t be fooled, however, because this machine is by no means perfect. Yes it looks cool, yes it is a breeze to set up and use, yes it makes stuff almost exactly like the pictures and yes it leaves the surrounding area as clean as it was when you got the thing out BUT I don\\'t believe this machine can ever get beyond its use of powdered milk for the milk in its milk-based products, because every one I have tried except for the Chai latte flavor, which I bought extra, has the artificial flavor characteristic of powdered milk coming through which kind of ruins the drinks for me. Oddly when I tasted just the milk component of the Chai tea latte drink I swear it tasted just like frothed or foamed milk.\\nI also bought the Chococino flavor cups for this machine because I drink cocoa nearly every day, and it isn\\'t bad but it does have an aftertaste that I don\\'t cotton to, and it lacks that fatty, creamy flavor that a really good cocoa made with whole milk has.\\nAs to pure coffee drinks, this machine does an excellent job of making them but, again, the flavor produced is merely excellent capsule coffee. Is it better capsule coffee than I\\'ve tasted from any of the Keurig-type cups I\\'ve tasted? Yes! Definitely!! Actually, there is no comparison. This stuff is hands down better than anything that comes from one of those machines.\\nIs it as good as a straight up coffee you can brew yourself? Probably not, except that most people don\\'t brew high end coffee and almost nobody makes stove top espresso, so it really comes down to whether you already make excellent coffee for yourself which you probably don\\'t and if you don\\'t live in the pacific northwest in which case you probably can\\'t get very good coffee anyways (and no starbucks isn\\'t a place you go to get good coffee, good coffee drinks...maybe, but not good coffee).\\nYes this review is coming from the pacific northwest which is a place where good coffee is just taken for granted and there really just is a lot of good brewed coffee and concoctions readily available out here. Having said that, this is The machine to go with even if, or especially if, you live in a place where excellent coffee is readily available But you MUST have an instant coffee machine.\\nI hoped this would be an opportunity to stop spending four dollars on a Chai and between two and three dollars for hot cocoa as I do every day (until recently Mcdonalds offered a really excellent hot chocolate for just two dollars but something changed about a year ago and now it doesn\\'t taste so good) but I don\\'t care for either the chococino or the chai tea latte enough to stop buying the coffee shop chai and chocolate I already do.\\nHaving said that, through experimentation have discovered that making the Chococino along with either a Luongo or the Espresso does make a really good Mocha (3 total capulses). Likewise, doubling up a Mocha and a Chococino makes a good brew as well (4 total capsules). I still have not figured out how to make the Chai latte \\'wetter\\' which would make it a far better drink, in my opinion. Also, one can experiment with using fluid levels different than those called for on the capsules to customize the flow and improve or tweak the end result.\\nIf I lived pretty much anywhere else I could be happy drinking the Chai and the enhanced Mochas this machine makes. As to the other flavors, the artificial flavor is kind of a deal killer for me but the non-flavored drinks are pretty good; as good as the coffee regularly served in all the cafes in Amsterdam, for instance, which is probably exactly what Nestle had in mind with this machine as I notice that there are larger versions of this contraption that are meant to be used semi-commercially.\\nI have no idea what use the cold setting is. I have tried to use it and it just produces what looks like dish water with weak coffee flavor.\\nAlso, it would be convenient if the water reservoir could be topped or filled without having to remove it entirely from the machine and the machine can\\'t sense when there is not enough water to complete the brewing cycle it just brews until it runs out of water and then starts flashing red, so keep an eye on water levels.\\nThe instructions, if there were any, aren\\'t great but once you have the pictographs figured out you realize it is no big deal anyway.\\nAnybody who hates all of the trash and waste created by our First World lives will also feel slightly appalled by the mounting pile of plastic waste as one brews just three or four coffee drinks for company, because each drink requires the use of two pods..only the straight coffees require just one, and as if that wasn\\'t too much already these aren\\'t flimsy light weight pods either.\\nI can\\'t really recommend this machine but I do kind of encourage you to get one if you were thinking you might, expecially if you live in Wyoming or Arkansas. I know that doesn\\'t make a whole lot of sense but this is why this machine rates four stars all day but can never be a five!Muy buen poder de mezclado, facil y rapidoThis Nescafe dolce gusto machine is unique from anything I\\'ve used before. I got to say it makes some good coffee but the really impressive aspect is the variety of drinks you can make with this device. Everything from a standard cup of coffee to a chai tea latte. The versatility of drinks is what makes this a winner.\\n\\nWhen you first open this appliance it\\'s got a very odd look/shape. I like it because it’s different and almost futuristic looking. They did well with making it match the modern stainless steel kitchens that have become common now. The one odd thing is the cord is bright red. It just seems weird but not a big deal if you tuck it away out of view.\\n\\nI’ve tried a number of drinks. The more regular coffee to me is a notch above some of the older single-serve machines but still not overly impressive. The other drinks this makes are really good. Such as the lattes or the specialty coffee drinks. The one catch to any of the single-serve machines is that the pods are pricey. For me, if you are using this instead of getting your morning coffee from a coffee shop then I could see this being a huge cost saver. The device itself is priced very well and actually much cheaper than other single-serve machines/brands. So the initial expense is well worth it for the device.\\n\\nOverall I really love the machine. It makes a wide variety of drinks that typically would difficult to make at home. It’s an expensive solution for more fancy drinks. I’m hooked and I’ll be ordering more of the pods because I use it instead of paying for a morning Starbucks latte. Not to mention it saves time as I’m rushing to get to work.i don\\'t drink coffee but all of my family and friends do. I have a regular coffee maker but sometimes my guests don\\'t like making coffee so I thought I would make it easier for them by getting a pod type coffee maker. Well, it\\'s a hit at family gatherings! Everyone loves it! It looks great as it is very sleek. The taste of the coffee according to my guests is awesome. The only problem with the Nescafe is that the water vessel is very hard to get out. It takes much more effort than I am comfortable with as you have to use a lot of pressure to get it out. I was afraid I was going to break it. I had to unplug it from the wall socket and used a lot of force to get it out. It should not be difficult to get out but it is. Other than that, it works just fine.Was bought as a Christmas gift. Worked great for the first 2 months then it stopped working. If you buy it, make sure to purchase the warranty. I didn\\'t buy the warranty and later saw the reviews of others having the same problem.Love the fact that I can make blended coffee drinks at home!Love it just wish I could find the damn pods easier.. can only find onlineEasy to use once you get use to it and good blending power and good flavor too. I\\'m happy I purchased it.Easy to use and fun making good expresso. Just wish there were more places to buy the pods.Quick, easy, no mess, tastes great. Even someone who wakes up with \"brain fog\" can\\'t screw this up. Got it on sale for $64.Tener la opción de un café gourmet en mi casa y poner disponer de el cuando yo quiera. excelente.Whether you like your coffee plain or fancy this compact machine will deliver. It is relatively small and has a cool futuristic appearance. The directions are clear and include words as well as pictures. The machine is simple to use and the results are uniformly excellent. You must use their pods; as far as I know, there is no reusable pod or alternative. It is easy to impress your friends with fancy cappuccinos and the like. Simple, delicious and fast. The machine is not too noisy. You can make cold as well as hot beverages with it.\\n\\nto the extent I have a quibble it is with the water tank. You must remove it to refill and replace it. The back is also open. It wishes there was a way to fill it while in position and I also wish it has a cover over the open part. But that is definitely not a deal-breaker. I am a caffeine fiend and am thrilled with this machine\\'s performance. Plus there is a good selection of pods so when the mood strikes I can easily make a fancy barista style beverage.This is a mixed review.\\n\\nOut of the box I followed the directions exactly but couldn\\'t get it to work. There was power and I could hear the pump running but no water flow. I called Nescafe support and they asked \"did you prime it first?\" There was nothing about that in the directions and no obvious button or knob for priming. They told me I needed to lift and lower the water tank with increasing force, which I did 200 times. Still no water flow, at which point they said to call Amazon and arrange for a return.\\n\\nI told them I thought that was terrible customer service. This wasn\\'t an inexpensive item and there was a quality control issue if it could leave the factory not working. Ideally they\\'d send out a new machine and a free return shipping label for the nonworking one. At minimum you\\'d think they\\'d offer a box of coffee pods or something for the inconvenience.\\n\\nAfter hanging up I kept playing with it figuring I had nothing to lose. I removed the needle from a meat injector and filled it with water. I then used that to try and force out any air in the machine. After about a dozen tries and water everywhere I got it to work. So for quality control they get a 0. For customer service I\\'ll give a generous one star for answering the phone and sounding pleasant even if unhekpful.\\n\\nNow the good part. Once I got it to work this machine makes great coffee. It puts every drop machine and Keurig I\\'ve owned to shame. And each cup is every bit as good as I get at the local coffee house at a fraction of the cost. It\\'s stylish and doesn\\'t take up a lot of counter space. I just wish it worked out of the box.\\n\\nIve used both the Nescafe capsules and a refillable DGPod I also purchased here on Amazon. I have to say the reusable pod is great and something i\\'d highly recommend as an accessory.The coffee tastes really great, better than anything I’ve had from Keurig but it’s really hard to find Dolce Gusto pods in LA stores. The machine also malfunctioned on me after having it for only a week. I’ve had to order a replacement (which was easy, just have to wait now). Hopefully the next one lasts!Only used it twice and it just stopped working. Worst thing is the return window just closed 2 days ago.Makes great cup of coffeeI was lucky to get this on Amazon\\'s big sale day. I love, love, love this Dolce Gusto Machine. What a treat to get cappuccino and other specialty drinks from a machine that doesn\\'t need for me to buy a new house with a counter big enough to hold any other expresso machine. Thrilled with this purchase!I got a great deal on this coffee maker and I understand they were going to discontinue this particular Dolce Gusto brand. I tried different Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee pods which are unique to this machine and I like most of them. The coffee tastes little creamy and I also found a reusable pod on Amazon. Too early to tell how good is the reusable pod is but I understand the coffee needs to be ground very fine like Espresso if you want to use the reusable pods. The only disadvantage if you can\\'t use the reusable pods is that these pods are not readily available. You can only buy on Amazon though they say they are also available at Staple\\'s.First I must say that I am a Vine reviewer and I received this NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto Coffee Machine, Genio 2, Espresso, Cappuccino and Latte Pod Machine free as part of the Vine Program. The Vine program is designed to generate reviews of new products. And I am always up to review something to do with coffee, Expresso etc., This is a great little machine. Its super easy to set up and use and makes wonderful coffee drinks. Its Automatic All you do is make sure the water container is full and has enough to make your cup size and load a pod. The coffee, espresso, etc., is hermetically sealed to insure it is also fresh and tastes wonderful. The machine can do with to thanks to the machine\\'s high 15 bars with its pressure system to make you coffee drinks like they Are professionally done. This is fantastic and can save you lots of money instead of buying these drinks out. You can make them at home for much less. There are all kinds of different pods to use. Mocha; Cafe Au Last; Latte Macchiato Regular and Vanilla Flavor, Carmel, Lungo Decaf; Cappuccino Regular and Skinny; Expresso Intenso; Coffee Medium Roast, Dark Roast; Grande Intenso Dark Roast, Americano and more. Just a wonderful selection, they all taste great. This is a Must have one cup Coffee Drinker Maker.Could be the caffeine that\\'s got me amped, but I love this thing! I was admittedly intimidated at first. There\\'s a step or two more than using a Keurig, but after reading the easy to follow directions and making my first cup, I can honestly say it\\'s super easy to use. The pods show you how many bars to set for each different one, so there\\'s no guess work involved. Even tells you how many ounces the end result will be so you can size your cup or mug accordingly. The overall size of the machine is significantly smaller than a Keurig, so you need less counter space or it can easily be stored in a cupboard and brought out whenever you need it. I was extremely impressed with the quickness of the heating cycle, much faster than any other machine I\\'ve used. As for the end result....really really good! I\\'ve always felt that you have to trade taste for the convenience of any coffee or espresso machine such as this. That\\'s absolutely not the case here though. Could easily do a side by side comparison with this Nescafe and the overpriced boutique coffee shop stuff and I bet most would not be able to tell a difference. All in all I\\'m extremely impressed and happy with it, and it\\'ll absolutely see continued use in my household.The NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto Coffee Machine, Genio 2, Espresso, Cappuccino and Latte Pod Machine was easy to set up and is easy to use. It probably helped that I watched a couple YouTube videos in advance.\\n\\nThe machine looks like a little penguin on my countertop, or maybe a coffee butler. You select your pod(s), make sure there’s enough water in the back, adjust your drip tray height, put in the selected pod and lock it in place, toggle to the desired water level, flip the lever to hot or cold, and watch your coffee being made!\\nIf you are having a drink that requires two pods, the instructions will show which one to insert first. It is usually the lighter colored pod.\\n\\nYou can mix and match to create your own custom drinks! I got the bundle with the assortment of coffee pods and it has been fun trying the different flavors. Add a little cinnamon if you like. This is a great for entertaining because guests are able to select their personal favorite flavors, and they aren’t restricted to the one or two pots you might otherwise brew.\\n\\nI think my coffee butler is a genius idea! 5 Stars!GoodFirst off the machine is easy to use and well made from what I can tell. I h a very no complaints with the machine itself but the coffee I find lacking bland and tasteless as it has no sweetness at all. I am not reviewing the coffee here so it still gets four stars as the machine is well made quick and great looking and as for the coffee there is always sugar that can be added.This little machine works really well, when you are on the go and need a quick espresso. The quality of the espresso is quite good and comes out with surprisingly good crema. My only comments would be it doesn’t come out as hot as I would like. Secondly even when I switch the settings for a bigger cup the amount still does not increase. So I end up having to brew an additional pod. Plus the pods are very pricey. But good little machine.This machine doesn\\'t offer the pod selection that many others do. I haven\\'t been able to get the peach tea for months. The Hot chocolate comes from England, so the delivery is greatly delayed. They actually ran out of their basic coffee for months as well. None of this was Covid related, happened before as well. The quality of each of the items mentioned is excellent. I would never recommend, or buy this product again because of these reasons. I will use up the rest of the pods, and look into a new machine. Any suggestions would be appreciated.The Nescafe Dolce Gusto (Genie 2) Coffee Machine is easy to set-up and use. It looks really cute and doesn’t take up a lot of space on the counter (i.e., ergonomically friendly). The pods are convenient and offer a great tasting cup of coffee. You can make caramel macchiato, americano, cappuccino, espresso, latte and other specialty coffees in mere minutes. Depending on the beverage, you either use one or two pods (a regular and a milk one). The box that the pods come in tells you where to place the indicator. Press start. Easy breezy. There is a handy bucket that you can put on the side of the machine, to toss the used pods (which is magnetic). And finally, it is portable, so if you travel, you can take it with you. Overall, this is a handy little appliance that makes a tasty cup of coffee.I love my Nescafe Dolce Gusto Genio 2 coffee machine . I bought also the cappuccino capsules and the flavor is amazing !!! The machine is easy to use , I gave the easy to clean just 4 stars because the water tank is not that easy to clean , but so far I am happy with my purchase !I\\'m loving this coffee maker. It\\'s very easy to use and it makes so many different types of delicious coffee. Depending on what I\\'m in the mood for, I can have a frothy latte or cappuccino or an excellent and tasty espresso. The specialty drinks (like the latte\\'s or cappuccino\\'s) use two pods to make. One pod is for the milk and the second is for the coffee. The frothy milk this produces tastes so good. I don\\'t ever have to go to a coffee shop any more.\\n\\nI have a different espresso machine with a milk frother but I only use it to make my coffee and I add my own milk. I\\'ve been too lazy (or too tired in the morning) to froth my milk. This machine does everything for me and it\\'s simple to use and the coffee tastes amazing.Good machine but the coffee is weakIn some ways, this NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto Coffee Machine, Genio 2 is more than a coffee machine. There are so many types of coffee drinks that can be made with this machine and the coffee pods, both hot and cold! At first I looked through the manual and was a bit overwhelmed and thought that it would be extremely difficult to use. It wasn\\'t however! Be sure to read the booklet when you start using it and cleaning it because it does have all the information you\\'ll need. The flavors that you can get for this machine is diverse from regular coffees to espresso and cappuccino! My mother who is the real coffeeholic just loves this machine and she can even figure it out herself! Very nice machine.hi, i ordered on June 20, and i dont know that each country have its own voltage and thats why it dont switch in Armenia. We forced to buy a device for make it work,But overall, its not a bad product.I\\'ve been using this Dolce Gusto Genio 2 machine for about two months and it is high quality. The temperature is piping hot. I bought a variety pack of their pods and most of them are impressive. This is what Keurig used to be. Keurig coffees have declined in quality and all taste the same, weak and watered down. Dolce Gusto coffees are strong, bold, and flavorful. You can tell this is good quality coffee. I also like that they have lattes with milk pods. This is very convenient to get a good latte to-go. I hope Dolce Gusto catches on and gains popularity. Or maybe not, considering what happened to Keurig.Love it!Easy to set up, very simple design yet delivers great tasting coffee; capsules are more expensive than keurig kcups but should not be compared because quality is so different. If you’re looking at costs, compare it with coffee you buy from coffee shops- it’s way better and you get to enjoy it in the comfort of your home, any time. I got some nice bodum double wall cups and espresso cups to make the experience even better. This machine is small and beautiful. Hoping to enjoy it for a long time.Love the machine. But why did the electrical cord need to be red !After warranty expires, even if you haven\\'t used this product but a couple of times a week, Dolce Gusto starts failing. In my case, it doesn\\'t turn off. I\\'m electronic expert, so after diagnosing it and realizing this is about a simple diode replacement, after repairing it a couple of times, and using it several more times, the same diode is constantly burning down. Probably the problem is being caused by something else, but for a regular user, it is simply money wasted in garbage.\\nThis is a great example as well as ink injection printers, on how planned obsolescence works. It doesn\\'t matter what you do, the product fails anyways, and the only solution is to purchase the new and unique and ultimate model. By the way, every year the old model is not being produced anymore, so you cannot expect any support, starting by that fact, it should be a red flag for anyone who wants to purchase quality and durable products.This machine is a great addition to any kitchen.\\n\\n1. I replaced a keurig machine with this and the first thing that I loved was the footprint difference. This machine is much smaller and freed up space on my counter.\\n\\n2. This machine makes lattes, cappuccinos, americanos, and many more with a capsule machine. Very convenient!\\n\\n3. Coffee flavor is much better than keurig.\\n\\n4. Heats up within 20 seconds!\\n\\n5. Ability to make cold drinks as well.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Capsules aren’t available in many stores. Your best bet is buying them on amazon.\\n\\n2. The water tank is somewhat small and needs to be refilled frequently.\\n\\n3. The toggle switch is decent but finicky at times.\\n\\nOverall I think this machine is a solid choice. I’m hoping that these machines are reliable, time will tell.I usually drink one cup of coffee a day, so I like single-serve brewers. I\\'ve used the \\'K\\' brewers in the past, but I\\'ve had a lot of problems with them, they just stop working after a while.\\n\\nI decided to try the Dolce Gusto, and I really like it. It\\'s really easy to use, and has a good variety of capsules. And cleanup? Not very much. It comes with a canister to dump the used capsules in, and I empty and clean it once a week.\\n\\nI\\'ve still got a pot brewer for when we\\'re entertaining and need more than a cup at a time. But the Dolce Gusto is my every day brewer.I wait one year to do this Review, this is my second machine, I have the old model still works great and I bought this one to take my old machine to my beach house.\\nI personally believe so far this is the best machine I ever had, the quality of the coffee is amazing, I\\'m half Italian and half Venezuelan so I\\'m very picky with my coffee, but with this machine you can easily do Espresso, Cappuccinos etc in less than a minute and have a great taste!... I wish they could sell the pods everywhere like Europe.No one in my house hold drinks coffee but we do like hot tea. I have tea pods that I\\'ve used in this and it seems to have worked just splendidly. So now we have hot tea whenever. Another perk when the mother in law comes for a visit she does drink coffee so this is great I just go get the coffee pods for her when shes here. Now I wont be wasting money on purchasing bags of coffee that goes stale within two to four weeks. She lives out of state so if she doesn\\'t take it with her again it then becomes waste. This is the perfect resolution for us when we have family in from out of state who drink coffee. Cleaning I just run distilled white vinegar through it to keep everything nice and clean.It’s easy to use, doesn’t take up a lot of space and make good drinks. I’ve tried the cappuccino and chococino and both drinks come out perfect! The pods are a little more expensive than the k pods but the drinks are higher quality. I just wish there could be more variety of teas to choose from. So far the chai latte is the only tea option and they are fairly expensive so I haven’t tried it yet.Reconsider this purchase. Dont limit yourself to Nescafe pods only. Prove and unavailbilty of certain pods makes this system absolute as I\\'ve been a user for 3 years. Try searching espresso intenso, can\\'t find them and if you do prices are off the charts.I\\'ve only tried these 2 and they are fantastic! Soooo much better than the store-bought ones! Don\\'t spend money on Starbucks or Peet\\'s anymore.Oh My WOW!!! First of all, I didn\\'t realize I would be getting coffee with this machine. And my goodness the array of coffees I received. Now on to the coffee machine itself. It\\'s small, so it doesn\\'t take up a lot of counter space.\\nI\\'m going to keep it real, I\\'m not good at understanding/comprehending directions. But the ones with this machine were so easy, I was able to set it up and learn the brewing steps. This is one nifty coffee pot. Now I just need to find out where to buy and if they have other items, such as not coco.First off I have a Nespresso machine which makes a very smooth tasting cup of coffee so I am a bit spoiled.\\nThe Nescafe medium roast had a bitter taste to me probably because I normally drink Nespresso with heavy cream. I tried the Medium Roast, the Skinny Cappucino and the Latte Macchiato and did not like any of them. I think the powdered milk gives it an off taste as well. I am picky about my coffee. I can\\'t drink coffee from McDonald\\'s either.\\n\\nOne problem I encountered is when you are done using the machine, the pods are full of water and I thought I had done something wrong. I emailed the company but never heard back from them.\\n\\nLastly, the sweet drinks are too sweet for me. It\\'s a cool concept but I never thought about not being able to sweeten it to my taste. I like Cafe Vienna from Maxwell House but I did not like these.\\n\\nThe sweet drinks use two pods. One is a powdered milk and the other coffee. The sugar and flavorings is in one of them.Super pleasantly surprised!! I was just looking for something that does just espresso, and now my bf and I don’t even need a coffee machine for him and you can make pretty much anything and not need one of those complicated machines! It also has a cold setting!! I was worried about finding the pods since it’s European so you’re pretty much limited to online, but it was worth it!If you really love cappuccino or latte, this is the best it gets outside of a coffee shop. And while the capsules are more expensive than most, and hard to find, Amazon always has plenty of choices.The NESCAFE did everything it said but I just didn\\'t enjoy the taste of the coffee.This machine is amazing! It make very flavorful, foamy lattes and cappuccinos. The espresso pods are bold and strong. The coffee is delicious. It took me a few times to get used to the machine, as I’m accustomed to a different kind of pod coffee maker, but it really is super easy. The pods tell you what volume to set the machine on for a perfect cup. The only issue I have is that the pods can be a little messy after they are brewed. They tend to drip when you remove them. I need to wipe up every time I make a coffee.Update!!\\nThis stopped working after a few month!! It won’t even turn on. I’ve tried everything. I called the maker and of course “a supervisor will call you back” but nothing.... It’s been 8 weeks. I’m sitting on 20 boxes of coffee that I can’t use. I was so excited about this too. It’s really disappointing. Poor machine quality and customer service. I went and bought a new Keurig with iced coffee function. It’s great to be back after all. Bye Dolce Gusto 👋\\n\\nI’m so happy to have this new coffee maker!! I was tired of the same old Keurig pods and wanted a change. Wow! There are so many flavors to choose from for this, so\\nyou can cater to the whole house and their individual preferences! From caramel and vanilla macchiato, dark expresso, medium roast, skinny cappuccino, mocha, etc. each mixed drink comes with a milk pod AND a coffee pod. The directions are on the box and it’s a picture so anyone can follow it. The machine itself is super easy to set up and use. Fill the tank up the max line, attach to the back of the machine, plug it in. Turn it on and use the joystick on the back to increase the markings indicating the number of ounces to brew. I usually do 10-12. Then I slide the pod in, pull the chrome handle down to close and push the joystick to the right for hot. (To the left is for cold coffee). When done, I pull the coffee pod out, put the White pod in the holder, slide it in, pull the chrome handle down again, adjust the joystick to show around 4 green lines and then push it to the right for hot milk and add it to the same mug, add my splenda and I’m good to go. I enjoy the various flavors and the taste of having brewed, frothy, flavored milk! No need for creamer anymore with the flavored drinks. This takes up a fraction of the space my Keurig does. It’s cute, compact and easy to operate. It’s neater too, since the pods pop out and go easily into the side disposable compartment that’s included. I think I’ve officially been converted away from long time friend, the Keurig! Try it! You won’t be disappointed. It’s like having high end, cafe’ specialty drinks every time, at a fraction of the cost of Starbucks.Oh my goodness! This is my new favorite thing. I am an avid coffee drinker and this makes the smoothest cup of coffee ever! Love it, and so does my entire family. It’s very small and compact.This machine has great tasting coffee capsules, the coffee tastes like the ones I order in Cafés, it comes out HOT, burning hot, like it should, if you want a cappuccino, this is for you, it makes great foam that lasts until your last sip. This machine is worth every penny.The best oneThis coffee maker is awesome! The price was right and the quality of coffee is superb! I wish the capsules were found locally and not having to order online, however, the consistency of taste is there. The machine heats up quickly and it was easy to use and set up. Compared with the keurig I prefer the taste and quality of coffee I get with the Dolce Gusto.This is super easy to set up and to clean. It took more time getting it out of the box then it did getting it ready to use. The instructions are clear amd simple. I tried the caramel latte so far and it is delicious!Easy to useHard to load and doesn’t work wellI was reallyy excited to make my fresh hot coffee, but this product just disappointed me. It takes me about 6-10 minutes to make a cup of coffee which is absurd for a coffee maker. Worst thing of all the coffee capsules sometimes get stuck and its annoying taking out. I read other reviews to give it a few months and then it\\'ll be get better but I got this on August and haven\\'t seen improvements. If only I can give this product back and get a refund it\\'ll be great.Excelente cafetera, me encanto súper recomendada.Unfortunately, the one we bought in Japan stopped working after 5 years so we upgraded to this newer model. We like the larger water tank, the new option for 10 and 12 Oz cups and the bucket for spent pods is also very convenient. It is very easy to setup, operate and clean.\\n\\nThis is a perfect example of making a good product, great and customizing it for the target market.I’m hooked! I usually only have 1 cup a day but this has made me crave it more. So easy to use and taste so much better. * update* still love this machine. I don’t understand why people buy the more expensive one. Same # of pressure bars.Really great machine, easy to use. Works great in small kitchens.Our Tassimo machine died and, rather than spend the big bucks replacing it, we went with this mach for about one-fifth the price. The capsules are less expensive and the flavor is great! We love it!The coffee tastes like real coffee and not the watered down version from my Keurig. It brings me back to the coffee I had in Milan last year on vacation. A great machine thats easy to use. So happy with the purchase.Outstanding!Live the multi layered cappuccinos! Good quality product and it’s easy to clean as well.Amazing 😍Excellent machine! Makes excellent coffee!Wow!!!!! Love this machine!! So easy to use ! Hate I’ve waited so long to get a nice latte making machine!! Get the frother toncomplete.My second machine, love this one better than the first!ExcellentLove love love this!!Excelent productthe best !!!!!love itttReceived this as a Christmas present. I really liked the options of drinks and the new coffee choices. However, after about 3 month it started leaking from the base. After researching, I found out a lot of these are leaking. I registered my machine and got the extended warranty. When I called customer support, I gave them all my information, and they said someone would call me back with instructions. Never received a call back. After several more attempts, nothing. I am sitting on a $200 paper weight with 100 coffee pods that doesn\\'t work with anything else. Support is horrible. Product doesn\\'t last. Sorry, I liked it for the 3 months it worked. I have an $800 Jura super automatic that has brewed over 12000 cups of coffee, and provided probably about 6000 cups of hot water for tea, for the past 13 years. Guess I\\'ll just upgrade that one, to one that also provides real frothed milk at the touch of a button.Ease. Gets better once you experiment!Looks nice!We had ordered this and after 4 months, it wouldn\\'t even power on. No major drops, no leaking that we could see that would cause it to short. It just stopped working entirely.\\n\\nThe only reason I\\'m giving this a 2 star rating, and not 1, is because when it DID work, it was great! It heated water and brewed coffee SO much faster than our K-Mini (that also died...they don\\'t make machines like they used to...).\\n\\nWhen it\\'s working, it\\'s great, but if the life expectancy of these is as short as the unit we received...be warned, it might not last long.Best coffee everBest coffee maker.ever.GoodI like the maker and would love to have kept it but I’m not going to pay a fortune for capsules I can only order and mostly in bulk.This would be a great coffee machine if the pods for it weren’t so expensive! Two boxes of of the pods is the price of the machine. Going to Starbucks is cheaper. The macho is so easy to use but not worth the price for the pods!Piece of crap. Had to call their customer support to get instructions to even just get water to run through it. Apparently air getting stuck in the lines is a common problem. In order to clear it, you have to lift the water reservoir up and down while it\\'s running many, many times. I got it to work doing that while on the phone with support but then just now cannot get it to work. I tried for 15 minutes straight. My arm hurts. What a huge PIA. Now I have to figure out how it all fits back in the box and return it. And the reusable cup I got to go with it.This is too expensive and if I cannot find the coffee pods anywhere. I returned it and got a Kuerig coffee maker instead.I\\'ve been using for 3months.\\nIt\\'s broken already.\\nSold b by amazon but they said I have to search Nescafe contacts and should contack them.what a great policy.\\nThanks amazon for treating long term customer like this.To be very honest, I’m absolutely unimpressed! The Genio 2 sucks. Maybe the other versions may be better but there definitely MUCH better coffee machines.Expecting a nice crema like the pictures? Then move on. This machine is not at all what it professes to be. There is no espresso experience here. No crema. Just coffee, ridiculously expensive coffee. The water reservoir is difficult to fill as it is oddly shaped. Take a pass, I wish I had...I have some high end Keurig machines, and a lower end one. I also have a Nespresso machine that uses the new high end pods. The Nespresso makes better coffee, but not by much. This item unfortunately reminds me of the competition to Soda Stream, despite it being name brand competition, the product was largely unsupported, and may now be obsolete. Maybe this coffee pod maker with proprietary pods you can only get on Amazon, is sold in Europe or Asia to a wider audience, but I\\'ve Never even seen a print or TV add for it in the USA. I looked so see if you could get those cheater pods for this one that you could fill on your own, but couldn\\'t find them. While I\\'m sure it makes good coffee based on the pressure used in the machine, and some of the other reviews. I wouldn\\'t even want it for the tax value through the VINE since chances are it will be off the market in a few years.\\n\\nI do have a suggestion for the maker, since they seem to know something about pressure and heat in making good coffee. I suggest maybe give this a dual selectable feed, the pod area if it took both Keurig style, and the proprietary pods so people would not have a paperweight when the other pods are no longer supported, or are too overpriced to use. The single cup machines are for busy people who also like variety. Flexibility is the key, and if you make it hard to get pods at only one location, then I\\'d rather have a Keurig. Not recommended in it\\'s current form. Note you don\\'t see any testing here cause I never ordered this, but I do have experience with products that go obsolete the moment you buy them, and I suspect this of having that potential.Q1the coffee maker lasted a week then shorted out and was done. It doesn’t make lattes with milk and was a real disappointment.defintely not worth the money.I have to admit I do like the flavor of Nescafe and the easiness of use but cannot get myself to create more garbage in the environment. Had one but got rid of it. Make my coffee on italian manual expresso or regular drip coffee and saving for a real expresso machineCan not get it to function , all it does is hums . Because of Covid and 4 family members passing I did not get it returned during lockdown . Expensive bummerTwo of my machines broke down within 3 months. Not a coincidence! Go for nespresso nowI wish i could give it 0 zero stars... it completely stopped working in less than a month. My fault is i decided to send it back to the manufacturer instead of amazon. After 5 weeks of no help what so ever I asked for a refund. They somehow lost my case and my machine....! Avoid at all costs.I got my Genio 2 January 30th, 2020 and then after 3 months the power button is not working, and I can’t reach the merchant that I buy from him this machine!!\\nSo for the merchant, please response to me to solve this problem.\\nThanks In advanceStop working didnt have it a year..poor service wont buy it againI just got it today\\' the water selector is not working does not stay on place. I was trying to clean it but is not working. Very dissatisfied!Coffee not hot and not that good. Machine leaks. Pods are hard to find and are expensive. Has a red cord that can be hard to hide.I\\'d look for a different product. I experienced numerous water leakages and it finally stopped working.I hated this machine. Every time I used it I would not pierce the pod. You can only use there cups. Anything else will not fit. I returned after 1 week.It tasted like watered down milk no matter what setting I put it on. So disappointed.Broke after four monthsI really wanted to like this product, as I like the Nescafe coffee capsules (Dark, Medium, Americano, etc) way better than any K-cup I\\'ve ever tried, and I like being able to have a 10-12 ounce mug-full. I wanted to love the Chai Tea Latte, the Mocha, the various flavored coffee macchiato lattes, and the other combos that utilized a milk capsule, but I found it impossible to love or like, or even accept, those capsules.\\n\\nAnd, you should know, I approached this Genio 2 with open arms and an open mind, because I really want my Chai Tea Lattes back that I used to get from a Tassimo machine, almost two decades ago now. When the Tassimo went out, I switched and bought a few Nespresso machines. (I\\'ve reviewed quite a few of the Nespresso machines since then.....) But Nespresso does not do tea, and our family does not really like the Nespresso machine that does large cups of coffee. I really wanted this machine: For quick and easy Chai tea lattes and large cups of coffee. I gave this a one-star rating: That does not mean I\\'m mad. It means I\\'m terribly disappointed.\\n\\nTwo major issues--and maybe one stems from the other: The capsules leak--aggressively leak--when trying to remove them from the machine. Also, the combo milk/coffee or tea capsules make extraordinarily weak and/or small portions. The capsules leak so much that I better have a dish cloth held underneath the capsule as I remove it from the machine. If I don\\'t have cloth right there, scalding fluid leaves a trail that is messy and a bit dangerous. Dare not use a cupped hand to catch the drips--liquid is too hot and you\\'ll get burned.\\n\\nI realized the just-coffee capsules don\\'t leak as much as the capsules that create the specialty drinks. Why is that? So, I started cutting open the capsules to see what was going on inside. I took my observations to the guys at the Nescafe Dolce Gusto toll-free number shown on the included instructions. (I spoke with three of them, on separate calls, before asking to speak with a supervisor. I never got to talk to a supervisor.) They told me that I should expect there to be liquid left over in the capsule after the pour. Which leads us to believe that the liquid would drip out of the holes in the top and bottom of the capsules. (Okay, but I don\\'t have this problem with K-cups in Kuerig machines......)\\n\\nI mentioned to these very polite Nescafe customer representatives that I measured the amount of liquid left in the capsules after the pour. All milk capsules--which contain only dissolvable powder--contained over 1.25 ounces of watery, (but fairly flavorful and important to the final result I think), liquid after the pour. That\\'s a lot! Go ahead and measure out that amount to see what it means to a short cup of latte! Mocha capsules contained the same unbelievable amount of liquid after the pour. No wonder the stuff was leaking out! Coffee capsules--which contain coffee grounds wrapped in a sort of cellophane pillow--were not able to hold so much liquid after the pour. Some capsules that made short coffees contained a little less than an ounce of liquid. Capsules for larger coffees, with larger pillows of coffee grounds inside, only contained a few teaspoons of liquid after a pour. All of it still wanted to leak out.....\\n\\nIs this a pressure problem with my particular machine? The last of the liquid not being forced out? Or, is this part of the design of the machine--like the customer service reps told me? I don\\'t know, but I won\\'t be buying another three-pack of the Chai Tea Latte, nor the three pack of the Dark Roast for my husband.\\n\\nPutting aside the leaking problem, I\\'d like to comment on a few things:\\n\\nThe machine is very easy to use. Contrary to many reviews I\\'ve seen here, the machine is intuitively easy to run. The capsule tops, and the boxes the capsules come in, advise the user of the suggested defaults for strength. They have transcribed strength into bars that show ounces of water used to make the pour. The user can easily adjust the bars to raise or lower the strength. For instance, when pouring a dark roast, my husband sets the bars to 12 ounces and I set the bars to 10 ounces.\\n\\nIf there is milk involved, you use two capsules for each drink. That means the box of capsules will include, say, 16 capsules, but will only make 8 drinks. The milk capsules are filled with dry powdered milk (and possibly some sugar and flavor and maybe a foaming agent?). Some milk drinks suggest using 5 bars, some use 2 or 3 or 4 bars. I\\'ve not been able to find a nice balance, and I\\'ve not been happy with any of the defaults: It\\'s either way too weak, or too intense a powdered milk flavor and sweet. (Starbucks is making some awfully good flavored creamers lately......Seems so much easier and personally manageable.)\\n\\nThe machine has a nice, tight footprint. It is kinda\\' cute. BUT IT HAS A BRIGHT RED CORD. I hate the cord color. I want all my kitchen cords to recede into the background. This red cord tells me how important it is every day. I know, but it does not have to keep reminding me!\\n\\nThe bulky size and boxy, over-sized, square, shape of the boxes of capsules is an annoyance that cannot be ignored and should be considered. The capsules are not nicely stacked in a nice, tight space. They are jumbled in a square box that takes up a lot of room. It is an issue that nobody really considers when first buying a machine, as your brain concentrates on finding a good-tasting brew. But over time, the way Nescafe boxes their product becomes a major space problem.\\n\\nThe flavor of some of the capsules that I have tried:\\n--Dark Roast makes a fine cup of coffee at 10 or 12 ounces.\\n--Medium Roast is my favorite for sipping alongside a nice breakfast. It is great with a touch of cream.\\n--Espresso. What can I say, except: If you want espresso, get a Nespresso.\\n--Americano is an average cup of coffee. Aren\\'t all Americano\\'s sort of middle of the road?\\n--Mocha--even though it\\'s a bit weak--is wonderful.\\n--Chai Tea is pitifully weak, no matter how few bars I use.\\n--Vanilla Latte Macchiato is not worth the effort.\\n--Caramel Latte Macchiato is a bit weak, but still good.\\n\\nBottom line: There is still no machine that I\\'ve tried that will give me a nice, decent-sized, potent chai tea latte. This machine is not the answer. But if you want a small and easy machine to give you flavorful, larger (10-12 ounce) cups of plain, dark and medium roast coffee, this is a decent machine--just put up with the excessive drips. If you want specialty, small coffee and milk creations, buy a Nespresso machine. If you want just espresso, there are so many choices, buy anything BUT this machine.Play Video\\n It just stop working 😭 on the 3rd day, it was a gifted to meDios mío, es la mejor inversión que he hecho, todos nos merecemos un buen café todos los días verdad? Aquí tienes esta máquina espectacular!I\\'ve been researching for a long time and I was even looking into buying one that were used but I truly didn\\'t find that many that was for sale. I am happy this is the v2 which is suppose to have a bigger water reservoir. Love it !I tried TWO very expensive espresso machines prior to this one. This was a fraction of the cost and I LOVE it. Its simple to use, small and doesn\\'t take up space, quiet, and make a very good tasting espresso, coffee or whatever else you want to make.My daughter LOVES her coffee and this is her favorite machine!!! Easy to use and taste fantastic!!! We are saving so much $ by using this!!!Would have given this 5 stars because it makes a great cup of coffee; however if you accidentally leave the pod in, it will get stuck and becomes a pain to remove.Love this machine. Easy to use. Directions are easy to followMuy buena me gusto muchoIt is not worth of money. The taste is normal.is exactly what i neededI LOVE THIS! I have so many great things to say about this item I\\'m not too sure where to start. This was a free VINE item and the company was nice enough to send 15 boxes of all of the flavors to try! I have tried all of them and I really love them! My favorite is the mocha latte, however they have something for everyone. Your able to brew your coffee, fresh and hot so fast. Just plug it in and its ready to brew in about 10 seconds. It creates such a great cup of coffee. Way better than kcups which to me seem watered down. These taste like coffee. Its also really compact and looks great on your counter top. This is a really great product and i highly recommend this for everyone!I got the coffee machine really cheap price and I was so excited but the coffee capsules are expensive than the machine. So I don’t know If it worth the get this kind of machine.Play Video\\n I love it !!!!Easy to use and clean. Great flavor highly recommendedIt’s one of the best coffee machinesbest purchase this year, loved it ..My whole family has fallen in love with this cute little machine and we’re using it way more than I expected!\\nIt’s easy to use, the two pod system is a no brainer and the frothy drink that it dispenses is yummilicious!\\nGot it on a Black Friday sale so it was a good deal!\\nBought another one(full price now) as a Christmas gift.I use this machine daily. Was a replacement for an earlier model (8 years or so) that started leaking. The best thing about it is the body and flavor of the coffee (Americano Intenso). But the machine itself has a couple of great updated features, namely, the water reservoir is much larger, holds water for several cups. Also, this machine cuts itself off when the cup is brewed just right! I still would like the coffee a bit hotter, but that\\'s easily fixed by zipping it in the microwave. Also, the price is good compared to competitors.Me encanto todo perfecto dulce gusto es mi café favorito.recomiendo esta maquinaI owned the 3 well know instant coffee maker , keurig , nespresso And Dolce gusto. After trying this one, im in love. This is the best among the 3.Play Video\\n Excelente compra, simple la amo 🥰 Amazon siempre me impresiona con lo que puedes adquirir, llego en perfectas condiciones, todo en su lugar, lo único que no trajo su pequeña revista que les ponen en algunas máquinas, lo cual no le preocupa por que al suscribirme en dolce gusto todo lo leo ahí, la recomiendo a 100%.\\n\\nNota- Cualquier avería pueden escribirle a dolce gusto por correo y ellos siempre atienden rápido y se resuelven los problemas.\\n\\nNo he tenido ningún percance con la máquina y todo sigue excelente, me gustaría que me regalaran cápsulas y sabores nuevos😅😎🤪\\n\\nEstoy casi casándome con ella 😍😘☕️I love the quickness of heating up, the size and shape. However, I wish the water container was larger, and the machine had a light when it was low on water. I have several times began to make coffee only to have 1/2 water tank and coffee stopped half way through, needed to stop and fill water reservoir to finish filling cup.I love the idea and love the fact that it is compact and makes good coffee, but you cannot buy pods in physical stores. And flavors are limited.Watered downCappuccino awful the powered milk smells and tastes awfulI decided to upgrade from a keurig to a more specialty coffee machine, but didn\\'t want a huge machine on my counters. THIS IS PERFECT! Its small, doesn\\'t take up much space and makes flavorful drinks quickly. Also, you can choose hot or cold so that\\'s awesome. If you\\'re thinking about it, do it!Highly recommended to all! Received on time (delivered to me on a SUNDAY).\\nEASY to set up, clean, and now sipping an amazing Cappuccino in less than 15 minutes.\\nWonderfully stylish design, yet small enough to fit even in my tiny apartment.\\nNow, to try everything...\\nfrom the Hot Chocolate or Chai Tea Latte, to the Caramel Latte Machiatto or the many Espresso and Coffee varieties. Love, love it!!I LOVE LOVE my Cafe Gusto~ reminds me of being in a little outdoor cafe ...I chose this bc with one touch you have a perfect creamy cup with nice froth on top unlike the more expensive brands that require a separate process to make the foam. I make dessert coffees for company, its so fast that you can make one cup after another with no time in between- I have my first cup of morning coffee after one touch within 30 seconds which is a big deal ! I\\'ve bought three for presents because of the reasonable price. I\\'ve had mine for 2 years with heavy use, it\\'s a little workhorse. I like the cafe au lait best which I buy on Amazon, each cup costs about 50 cents- I\\'ve saved untold amounts of money from buying out. They have really made an amazing product- bravo !We enjoy of this coffee maker!Me gusta la cafetera porque es pequeña y sirve para preparar los cafesI\\'m a Starbucks addict! Or rather, I used to be. I\\'ve had it about a week now and by the end of next week it will have payed for itself. I only drink lattes and I\\'ve bought a few machines in the past and none of them have come even close to making something that looks and tastes like it was made by a barista. This machine makes it PERFECTLY! I\\'m so pleased I bought this. 10 stars!Was i surprised about what this little machine can do. The coffee tastes great . I made a cappuccino it was delicious. Easy to use perfect every time. Saves me tons of money by making it at home . Glad I bought it. Can not beat the price . 😊NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto Coffee machine makes it super easy to enjoy a wonderful cup of cappuccino and other speciality coffees, just pop in the desired coffee pod and follow the brewing instructions on the lid and out comes a perfect cup of whatever 👍Don\\'t waste your money on this machine I had it for 15 months after that the machine had a short circuit to Repair the machine you\\'ll pay double of its original price be careful also you have to buy all the coffee capsules from Amazon not anywhere else.That\\'s all that matters!We have used this coffee machine every day for the past 3 months.. it works beautifully. I bought refillable pods for it and also an adapter to use the other Nescafe coffee pods that they sell at the grocery store. I wish that they still sold the Dolce Gusto pods here in the US.. but we are still able to get some from the UK on Amazon so we have treated ourselves to the Dolce Gusto Mochachino and Mocha coffee pods. :) .My favorite coffee machine, easy to use and nothing special! Just buy capsules and enjoy your coffee.I love it! It is so easy to use and makes the best espresso! Don\\'t waste your money on a Nespresso machine & buy this insteadI bought this to replace a Dolce Gusto Circolo that gave up the ghost after more than five years of solid use at home. I was debating between this one and the Esperta 2, as well as the top-of-the-line Majesto. I originally thought I\\'d splurge and go for the Majesto which would be a logical replacement for my Circolo, but then I thought better of it and decided to just go with this Genio 2 for a number of reasons:\\n\\n1. I expected it to make the same great-tasting coffee as the more expensive model; same pods, same bars of pressure, etc. And the answer is: Yes, the coffee tastes just as good as with my old Circolo, so I would bet it would taste the same as the Majesto brewed coffee too. In fact, this one makes it hotter than my Circolo did, so it lasts hot/warm longer, and maybe it\\'s my imagination but it seems to also make a thicker crema for an even tastier treat.\\n\\n2. The water receptacle is BIGGER than my old Circolo. Maybe not as big as the more expensive models, but large enough capacity that I don\\'t have to refill it too often. It\\'s probably not a good idea to let the water sit for a long time in the receptacle anyway because the water may get a little \"stale\". So 45 ounce capacity is ideal, and you really don\\'t need the larger 60 ounces for a couple of reasons, one of which being the stagnation of too much water sitting around, and the other reason being the following point....\\n\\n3. This has a smaller footprint than the other more expensive models with the slightly larger water receptacles, so it takes up half the counter space as my old Circolo. My wife is happy too because the kitchen counter looks neater too.\\n\\n4. It\\'s not as \"digital\" so I hope it lasts longer than the more expensive models because this one has less software related things that can break or cause problems.\\n\\n5. It has a red cord. So what?! I notice a lot of people make an issue of it and even downgrade it for this. Why? If you know you\\'re not going to like the red cord then don\\'t buy it, and definitely don\\'t buy it then write up a review with a downgrade for the cord color. Move on to something else and don\\'t knock this great coffee maker. Or wrap the red cord in black electrical tape if that\\'s your preference. In any case, if the coffee maker is against the wall or in a corner of your kitchen somewhere then the cord won\\'t be noticeable anyway.\\n\\n6. Finally, I was also considering buying one of Nespresso machines to try something new. I\\'ve had their coffee too and it tastes really good. However, I decided to stick with Dolce Gusto because:\\n- I already have a lot of coffee pods that I really like. Not a primary consideration for sticking with this form factor because my brother has a Dolce Gusto and I would have given him all of my pods, but this leads to my next point....\\n- Dolce Gusto makes what I consider to be amazing pods that you can\\'t find for any other machine, such as the Cortado Decaf (my favorite of all of them), plus the various teas and fancy drinks my wife and daughter like, etc.\\n- There are still plenty of places to buy Dolce Gusto pods online, such as Amazon, Ebay, and a few other sellers.\\n- Dolce Gusto pods cost half as much as Nespresso. No reason to pay more for delicious tasting coffee.\\n\\nIt\\'s a great machine that\\'s easy to use; takes up little kitchen counter space; and if experience serves as an example as it has in my case, it should give you many years of service. And it\\'s also cheap enough that if one day I get tired of it I can just toss it and buy something else, like one of the Nespresso machines.\\n\\nGood luck with your decision!The coffee cartridges are not available. Coffee is week and not a hardy cup. If you use a large mug you\\'ll use two coffees.\\nIt was a gift for my husband and he still uses our old pot and makes mine in the Nescafe\\'Please ignore all the negative reviews, this coffee machine is amazing and the coffee pods have an incredible taste, better than i have ever tried before. 10/10 extremely recommendedI love it!!Love it, easy to useA friend had one and I loved her cappuccinos and lattes so I had to get my own. I love everything about it.LOVE this machine! Perfect espresso. Gets you going for the day!!!! This is not a typical coffee machine. Its meant for espresso and latte\\'s. Everyone complaining that the \"coffee is too strong\"...well duh...that\\'s because it\\'s not coffee. LoL! I\\'ve been looking for a machine that\\'s makes it easy and yummy. Make sure you buy the correct capsules and capsule holder. I didn\\'t realize the don\\'t fit in the typical one. Easy to fill and clean. The adjustable deck is definitely a bonus :)I can only speak on the caramel macchiato but it’s really good. Definitely recommend.Me encanto desde que la tengo no he vuelto a tomar café cubano con leche 😁🥰Fun easy and makes cool hot or cold drinksSimple and convenientIt is so small and cute, but what a powerful little machine. Hot coffee, many choices, Easy to use, I absolutely love it.Love this coffee machine, it does from\\nSpecialty coffee to expresó the flavor of the latte is super I love it . I wish the capsules will be sold in US in all food stores. It is really expensive thru Amazon. You can by the box outside the county for $5.99I bought this for my granddaughter who is a freshman in college and spent a fortune at the coffee shop. I thought this could save some money it’s small and will fit in her dormBuen tamaño y facil de usar lo unico es que el cable viene rojo.Great machine; compact; fast heat-up; clever control lever; great capsule choices.\\nI made one modification. While we love this diminutive machine and the delicious coffee it makes, lifting the small water tank off its place, taking it to the sink to refill and then carefully positioning it into place on the back gets a little old after awhile, since being spoiled by the water tank on our old Keurig. So I just made a hole in the water tank with a soldering iron, bought a 1000ml funnel spout pitcher with a long thin spout on Amazon, perfect for filling and re-filling the tank while in place and next to the machine. When not being refilled, I keep a spare rubber wine bottle stopper in the hole I made.Thank you very much.I\\'ve never really written a review on any product but this coffee machine is hands down the best there is. And I\\'ve tried several from drip, French press, pod machines and even Flavia. Nothing beats this little beast. The coffee comes out with perfect temperature, the best \"crema\" and I feel even better than what they have in some of the coffee places. The Nescafe dolce gusto pods (I\\'ve tried cappuccino, latte macchiato and even the chococino) are all good, top of the line espressos. Now whenever I have a coffee I feel like I am treating myself.Absolutely perfect espresso and coffees. The foam and flavor is perfect! Very hot and did above what I expected! I live it!I bouth it for my dauther she love itGreat coffee brewer, great flavor selection, almost instant heating. Would be better if cups were available in stores instead of online only. Now I am stuck with boxes of their coffee that won\\'t fit other machines. Terrible junk - made in China!\\nThey won\\'t even tell you how long is warrantee - you must request warr. info. fromanufactorer. WHAT??? !!!I\\'ve had a Dolce Gusto machine for over 15 years. Mine finally stopped working and I bought this new one. I like the new self- stop feature.Es practica, funciona perfectamente para mi yo compre el pod plástico para alternar mi café ya que los pod comerciales son un poco costosos pero saben deliciosos….After been used over exactly a year, suddenly now it doesn\\'t turn on.. I learned about factory warranty 2 years, I contacted by phone but they said than has to be by email. So I did so. Now it has been over 5 days an nothing has happen. No calls.. also I sent a email to Amazon customer care for sort of advise. Nothing too.Absolutely delicious and you’re at home. Uses virtually no counter spaceI\\'m in love with this machine!\\nI know the capsules are available online only but it worth it\\nCoffee is delicious, taste and quality everything is perfect !GoodThis is the BEST espresso machine ever! I have probably tried them all. Discovered this gem in Europe last month and was pleased to find there was a 110 version. The pods are much less expensive than the Tassimo ones too.\\nIt\\'s faster and easier to adjust the volume. I am hooked. My Tassimo is now on the shelf as a backup.Love itGoodGreatMe debió haber llegado el 18 de Agosto y estamos a 24 de Agosto y aún no me llega\\nEstoy muy descontento con este proveedorNo sirvió el equipoI received a USED PRODUCT, Today was my Wife birthday and this coffee machine is the perfect gift for her office.. But... When we open the box.. \"USED PRODUCT INSIDE....\" I am very disappointedFell in love with the Dolce machine while in Europe years ago. This will be our third one in ten years. We use it at least 6-8 times a day and would never trade it for a Tassimo or a Kuerig which we\\'ve tried. The pods are hard to find but the flavour from the real Nescafe Dolce pods cannot be beat.I don\\'t have a kureig but i love my nescafee...that\\'s where i can get my cappuccino coffee my favorite :DSabor, fácil de usar.Price fluctuates.. I bought this at 175$ 2-days ago. Its $138 now... Sucks but atleast the coffee is good and has a ton of varietyWe love the Dolce Gusto coffee maker, but the problem is you can only find coffee through Amazon, it is a great little machine and we hope it lasts longer than the Keurig machine.I personally like Nescafe Dolce Gusto over Nespresso.we only got this because it is easy to use and it has different flavour drinks.
