0,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"""Is this a good coffee maker?"" Well, that's going to depend upon your expectations in coffee.

If you're looking for a ""pod coffee maker"" that makes normal drip coffee (think Keurig) then Nespresso is somewhat different, and may or may not meet your expectations.

I also have a Keurig. It's just fine for brewing basic, cheap coffee (or more expensive if you buy major-brand-name capsules). I like my Keurig--we've had it for over 5 years, and it works great. But, those who are environmentally conscious will soon realize that Keurig is not recyclable at all, and countless billions of pods a year are making their way into landfills.

Nespresso's pods are made of 100% recycled/recyclable aluminum. Nespresso is VERY focused on a goal of 100% recycle-ability, and provides recycling bags with fully pre-paid shipping. Fill the bag (holds about 75-100 capsules), seal it, and drop it off at your nearest UPS store (or Nespresso store/kiosk if you happen to have one in a mall nearby). Nespresso will dismantle the pods, collect all the used grounds and process it into compost for landscaping use, and then melt down the pods and recycle them. 100% recycled!

All those recycling costs are already built in to the pod cost, so while these pods are more expensive than Keurig, there is ZERO waste as long as the consumer does their job.

The best way I can describe Nespresso is it's a totally new coffee ""experience."" Espresso or ""foo foo coffee"" lovers will likely be very pleased with this machine line. Folks who aren't impressed with anything beyond a drip cup may find Nespresso a little ""snooty"" for them.

Nespresso's Vertuo product produces coffee that is much more similar to a cup of espresso. The pods are spun at variable RPM's (typically 3000 - 7000RPM) and use ""centrifusion"" - a made up word intended to commingle ""centrifugal force"" and ""infusion"". Basically, they spin the pod, a pump squirts in water, and the spinning forces produce the coffee which is extracted and drips into the cup. It's not particularly noisy for a kitchen appliance, but you can definitely hear the spinning. Regardless of pod, they all come out with a layer of crema (coffee foam). There are (at the moment) five ""sizes"" of pods, which produce 1.5oz (espresso) up through 14 oz (""Alto XL"").

As with any product line, there are pros and cons. There are some fantastic things about Vertuo and a few limitations.

Pros: Absolutely fantastic coffee. All cups have a crema layer on them, and there are a relatively plentiful number of flavors and intensities available, ranging from lighter and fruitier/acidic flavors all the way up to very dark bold and smoky options. There are seasonal special pods as well, such as holiday blends or single-origin ""master"" type coffees. Pods and contents are 100% recyclable. Easy to use out of the box--there's ONE button. You press it. It works. Milk frother (optional add-on, included in our purchase) is FANTASTIC. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but I use it with every cup! It's easy to use, and creates that ""latte experience""--it makes better lattes' than a certain really large chain whose name ends with ""bucks""--yeah, you'll spend 'em there. Pod cost, compared to an espresso shop brewing an equivalent latte for you, is cheap. VERY tightly-integrated recycling: drop pods in bag. Bag full? Seal it and drop it off at your UPS store. Pre-paid return shipping means zero-extra cost. Done. Milk frother is VERY easy to clean--takes about 15 seconds, if that. I've only owned the machine for a month, but the build and overall experience lends itself to belief this is a very high-quality unit. Excellent app (iOS/Android)---you can view/order/manage pods, accessories, maintenance/cleaning products and subscriptions right from your phone/tablet. Love a particular flavor? Just add it to your cart. It even supports automatic/routine replenishment if you want that. Seasonal and other specials show up in the app when available, making the app a one-stop-shop. Company is VERY plugged in environmentally and has created a coffee experience that doesn't fill a landfill. If you actually play the game the way Nespresso intends, it's a holistic coffee experience and a great one at that.

Cons: No third-party pods, and pods are relatively expensive when compared to other ""pod"" brewing standards. You want this machine? You'll be buying Nespresso-branded pods from Nespresso, or authorized resellers, and at full-tilt retail which typically runs about $0.90 for an Espresso pod and up to $1.20 for their normal coffees (some origins are as high as $2.00 a pod). So each cup is roughly double the cost of a Keurig brew. There are about 20 different pod flavors and five sizes available, so most people will find SOMETHING they like, but if you don't love one of the 20, you're out of luck as there are no 3rd-party options without ""hacking together"" a used pod, some self-ground coffee, and some foil cap stickers you found on the Internet.

Overall, this is an EXCELLENT machine for those who want more than a pod of coffee. I've owned it for a month and I'm 100% hooked."
1,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,"We have used this machine daily since purchase 3 months ago and love it. I can back to write a review because of the quality of Nespresso customer service. The machine didn’t brew today and I called the support line after trying the online troubleshooting tips without success. My call was answered by a live, pleasant and helpful person after two rings! She used a one way video call to see the machine and walked me through a few different steps that fixed the issue. So refreshing!"
2,5.0,2018-12-10,기계 전용, 그레이,"The inside box that the machine came in had been damaged, but the machine was not damaged. No where was I in formed that the machine came in a damaged box - should have been informed, before purchasing."
3,5.0,2022-09-15,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"I’m loving this machine! I’ve had many different ones, I’m currently away at work and can’t use my Jura. This little thing is amazing for the price! And the milk frother I love so much! Got it with the milk frother and 12 capsules! It’s also Bluetooth (still gotta figure that out) ! I recommend this product!"
4,5.0,2022-09-24,기계 전용, 블랙,This is the best purchase! My fiancé and I use this every single day. The machine is easy to use and the espresso pods are delicious. We used to get Starbucks every morning and we’ve saved so much money now that we use this machine. We make an iced caramel macchiato and it’s tastes better than Starbucks in our option. I’ve convinced both of my sisters to buy one and they love it as well! Would definitely recommend.
5,5.0,2022-09-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I love this product. I used to go to Starbucks at least three times a day BUT these days I go maybe two to three times a week SINCE I GOT THIS MACHINE.
6,5.0,2022-09-07,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"Channel your inner barista with this!! So many options, easy to use and affordable when comparing costs to Starbs or Dunkin! Get one!! You need it!!!"
7,5.0,2022-09-14,기계 전용, 그레이,"Espresso as good as it gets. Don’t know what “blending power” means, but the machine itself blends in nicely with the decor of my book shelves of 17th manuscripts.

And yes, it is quite easy to use if one has water and electricity handy, and the flavor, as suggested above, is nonpareil."
8,5.0,2022-09-16,기계 전용, 그레이,Love yourself enough to go ahead and upgrade!
9,5.0,2022-08-28,기계 전용, 레드,I really love this machine. It’s a beautiful red! Quiet when the coffee is being made. I’ll never go back to Kureg
10,5.0,2022-09-23,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"So much better than a K-Cup. Only thing that stinks is I couldn't find it in stores, had to get it off Amazon. All the stars only have the new pod size (it's something with a ""V""), and I wanted the classic style.

Works great. Produces strong tasting espresso, and the pods are recyclable. What's not to like?"
11,5.0,2022-09-14,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"Moved to keurig not for the convenience but for the environmental impact. As long as the cups are recycled, it uses less energy and less water than the drip and bunn machines. That said, i had sacrificed a good cup of coffee for this. Then i was gifted a KCafe which includes the frother, and options opened up, but the coffee remained so so.

So, then a friend tells me about this beauty!! OMG!! Not only does it brew a strong, delicious cup of real coffee, the pods are fully recyclable- through the company. The machine has a lovely form factor, and is a pleasure to use!! It’s quiet, and quick. I’m no fan of Starbucks burnt coffee, i prefer my coffee tasty, and this was surprisingly smooth, nutty, and delicious.

Also, when you go to the website, there is a nice selection of flavors to choose from. And yes, you can get hot water from it (press the button three times). Would I recommend? Heck yeah.

Happy camper, trying to convince myself that a cup of coffee at 11pm is cool, lol.

7/22- just wanted to add! My aerocinno3 suddenly stopped frothing my milk this week, after months of working beautifully. I called Nespresso, and not only to I learn about my machine, but i also learned that sometimes a bad carton milk will cause issues. Here i am cursing the machine, reading all the negative reviews and then as soon as I swap to a new jug of milk... It's working it's magic again! I just wanted to stop by and encourage anyone who's skeptical- take a moment to do some digging, this machine is awesome and the support at the company is superb! Still a happy camper!"
12,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,"Get this Nespresso machine with a separate milk warmer/frother for convince. The machine does all the work and it takes great. Super easy to use (just like a keurig), comes with samples and a coupon for $10 off their website of course. There are 3 different size pods/cups (espresso, double espresso and coffee), and the machine detects that and makes it with the correct amount of water. The pods are not too bad. Range from $10-$20 for a pack of 10 pods on their website. Perfect for an espresso martini too!"
13,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 + 캡슐 VertuoLine, 잉크 블랙.,So far this has exceeded expectations! No more $7 coffee at Starbucks -- I like this far better and saving a ton over the long-term.
14,5.0,2022-08-22,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I bought this with skepticism. I was used to toying with the wands on expensive espresso machines, struggling to make froth. But my skepticism was misplaced. This simple device is a breeze and the quality of the froth it makes it simply superb: Pour in milk (I've even used goat milk), press the button and a minute later the Vertuo has made a cup of froth that would please the best barista. An easy 5 stars."
15,5.0,2022-05-01,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,This machine blends and froths as well as our expensive gourmet machine. Impressed. Great addition to our office.
16,5.0,2022-08-04,기계 전용, 레드,This has been the best Amazon purchase by far! I cannot get those my week without this nespresso machine. Works perfectly and is so easy to use.
17,5.0,2022-09-06,기계 전용, 블랙,Husband thanks me daily for his Nespresso!
18,4.0,2022-08-09,머신 + 에어로치노, 매트 블랙.,The machine makes a great cup of coffee but sometimes I want a little less or more water in my coffee. This is a one button machine and you get what the machine reads on the barcode of the pod. I love it but I need to keep my other machine for when I want something different.
19,4.0,2022-09-07,기계 전용, 레드,".I am not a frequent coffee drinker but this machine has totally converted me (and the coffee, which is delicious). I recycle the capsules and I compost the coffee. The Aeroccino is an absolute must. I have now tried many types of coffee. I have found those I’ve preferred but even those I haven’t have been excellent, just too strong for my taste. I LOVE the guide describing the intensity and other descriptors of the coffees, and they are on the mark. One critical comment: please consider shipping coffee in an unmarked box! I’m grateful no one took my box from my stoop while I was at work considering NESPRESSO was prominently displayed on the box."
20,5.0,2022-08-30,기계 전용, 그레이,We use it daily! Coffee/espresso is delicious. Super easy to get my daily espresso
21,5.0,2022-09-13,기계 전용, 블랙,1st experienced the Nespresso Expresso’s while working in Middle East. Little did I know they originated from USA Nestle brands! I’m on my 2nd machine & still love it! This one provides both regular coffees as well as expressos!
22,5.0,2022-08-08,기계 전용, 그레이,"Our last Vertuo died and we needed a replacement. We didn't realize how much the technology had been upgraded since we had first started using our original model.
This design is VERY sleek and modern. I love that it opens and closes with basically no effort. I love that the tank can be positioned in a variety of ways.
We love our Vertuo and highly recommend it!"

I don't want to mislead anyone, because I'm sure each item is a little bit different, as far as wear and tear goes, but I am very impressed with this seller, so far! And if there are any changes, I will be sure to make an update."
25,5.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"Makes the most wonderful cups of coffee and espresso ever. I regret not splurging and buying this package earlier. Loved the sample pack that came with it also to try lots of different variety. If you’re on the fence about buying it, don’t be, you won’t regret it!"
26,5.0,2022-09-01,기계 전용, 레드,"My wife is a coffee addict so I decided to purchased this for her birthday and she absolutely loves it! In addition to the quality of the machine construction, it is easy to use. Brewing time is about 2 minutes. She also loves the variety of nespresso pods it came with. Definitely worth it."
27,5.0,2022-08-14,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,El café es riquísimo. Y la cafetera súper fácil y práctica. Me encanta

29,5.0,2022-09-08,기계 전용, 레드,This isn’t one of those confusing machines with knobs and gauges. You toss a pod in and press the button. It’s quiet and makes good espresso and coffee. I’ve wanted one for years. Zero regret!

31,5.0,2022-08-06,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"We had been living with our old one cup brew that splattered everywhere until we finally decided to take the plunge into the Nespresso world, and boy are we glad we did. The Verturo is great! It scans the top of the capsule to determine which of the three sizes, and what parameters to use. The result is the perfect cup of expresso, cappuccino, or Americana, whatever your heart desires. The warmer/froth machine that came with it is exactly as amazing. The only downside is, the capsules are really expensive. If you compare it to going out to Starbucks everyday, it’s much cheaper of course. Other than that, highly recommend it!"
32,5.0,2022-07-31,기계 전용, 그레이,This is amazing coffee maker. In the morning people come to my house just to get a cup of coffee before work.

34,5.0,2022-08-11,기계 전용, 레드,We took this on a camping trip and afterward decided we don’t need to go to Starbucks anymore. This baby makes delicious coffee!
35,5.0,2022-08-11,기계 전용, 그레이,"I bought this coffer maker as a gift and it has been very well received. Much better taste profile than other pod coffee makers. The Nespresso leaves no plastic flavor, the pods are aluminum, and it's very easy to use."
36,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,Easy to use. Just wish the pods were more accessible in retail stores
37,5.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I've had these products for three months and used them every morning -- I LOVE not going to S----ucks anymore! I have had nothing but great results and have not one negative comment about them... I read reviews that said the frother didn't make enough noise so he didn't know it was done - it has a light that goes on when you push the button to start it, and it goes off when it' s done. I find that the timing of making the coffee and milk frothing is almost exactly the same (open the unit, put new pod in, close unit and as it warms up to start, put milk in frother and the maker is then ready to go - start them both and they finish about the same time. I find that low fat milks froth just fine despite what other reviews have said (I use 1% most of the time). LOVE that it senses the ""size"" of the coffee/espresso pods and brews with the appropriate amount of water (you don't have to push a button to choose a size - but you can push the start button again if you want to dilute it). LOVE that the pods are recyclable and that the company provides postage free collection bags for that. LOVE the variety of coffees and espressos available (even by the mermaid brand), and last but not least, I get to think of George Clooney every morning as I make my coffee/espresso! P.S. I recently bought the ""Double Wall Glass Coffee mugs, (4-Pcak) 12 Ounces-Clear Glass Coffee Cups"" so I could see how beautiful the drinks were as they are made, making the ""event"" each morning even more enjoyable!"
38,5.0,2022-08-18,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I was very interested in purchasing a single cup coffee machine and I knew I didn't want a Keurig because that would basically be like drinking out of a toilet. I did first purchasing a Nespresso Vertuo Plus only to be having grounds in my cup and it throwing error codes within a month of having it so I sent it back. I then purchased the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and haven't looked back. I am very pleased with the quality of coffee it produces. I even refill my own pods and I am amazed at how the coffee still tastes so good! I did a taste test comparison using the same coffee in a regular coffee pot vs the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and it does make a difference! Nespresso brews a less bitter coffee! I also love the Aeroccino, I use it daily and I love that you can do a hot or cold foam. I recommend it to anyone looking for a single serve coffee machine. It is 100% worth it!"
39,5.0,2022-07-04,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"I was a barista for 3 years and am extremely picky about coffee. I did a lot of research and finally landed on this the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and I have to say this might have been the best purchase I have ever made! I needed something that would satisfy my ""boujee"" coffee lifestyle but still give my partner the ability to have his lam..... I mean normal coffee. The price of the pods, milk, and syrups are nothing in comparison to paying $5-7 for one latte 2-3 times a day.

Let me break it down (If you drink lattes every day):
- $3-5 for a gallon of lactose free milk that last me a week and a half or so
- $3-5 for vanilla syrup
- $1.5-3 for caramel or chocolate syrup (You don't need to get the high end stuff. I promise it almost all taste the same at the end of the day. You're just paying for the brand.)
- $0.87 for the pod depending on the one you get and if you get them in bulk (That can be recycled!)
- Reusable cups/straws
- No gas
- No waiting in lines

Seriously people. The hardest thing you'll have to do with all of this is find out what your favorite coffee roast is. And they even make that easy by providing you a sample box with like 12ish (can't remember off the top of my head) pods to try! My favorite is the small gold one. It's similar to the the Starbucks blonde espresso (which you can also buy pods of!)

Other perks:
- Super easy to clean
- Really easy to refill

Buy it. That's it. Just do it."
40,5.0,2022-08-22,기계 전용, 그레이,"This is coffee on another level! Every cup is brewed consistently, coffee or espresso or double shot. These are amazingly fresh and sealed so that the coffee tastes way better than K-cups from Petes or Starbucks. The machine is fast and even discards the pods into a container so it doesn't stand around all day, with the taste of the old and used grounds going into your next cup. The coffee will be a bit pricier and you will have to reorder from their website. It will average around $1.00-1.30 per coffee or espresso. But to be honest, to get this quality of coffee this fast right at your place is well worh it. I've had world famous coffee for example in Colombia, and their stuff is pretty close, obviously not as if you're there but the taste is surprisingly good. Can't go back to K-pods, ever. Even beats Starbucks fresh brewed, half the price."

44,1.0,2022-08-19,기계 전용, 블랙,"UPDATE: I went for a Keurig K-Supreme Plus instead and it's one of the best things I've ever purchased! I am absolutely in love with it (and I don't usually get so enthusiastic about things that I've purchased)! Delicious coffee within seconds every morning – it actually makes me look forward to morning time, and so much variety!! It probably sounds like I'm affiliated with Keurig but I'm not, and I'm not being paid for this review. I just don't understand why Nespresso has such a following (I had tried this out because a friend told me that it's waaay better than Keurig, and that is definitely not true).

High-level faults before getting into the fraud/scam details:
1. It is very difficult to use. I work in tech, and love tech gadgets. With this thing, it's ridiculously difficult to figure out how to make a cup of coffee. I had to watch numerous YouTube videos. The amount of different combinations of button presses for each different function is just crazy. For example ""tap the coffee button three times within 2 seconds, hold two buttons for more than 3 seconds, then tap the coffee button to confirm. Then a green light will flash three times, followed by a solid orange light..."". I can pretty much guarantee you won't even be able to open the machine to put a pod in there without watching a YouTube video.
2. There is a VERY limited selection of coffees. While every coffee company out there makes pods for Keurig machines, Nespresso machines read a barcode on each pod, and will not do anything unless the pod is from Nespresso or Starbucks.
3. The coffee is just meh. I don't know what all the great reviews are about.

Now for the fraud part – seriously, there's a whole reddit thread about suing Nespresso for this:

I received my Nespresso Vertuo Plus today and was very disappointed to find out (after a lot of frustrating, time-wasting troubleshooting and researching) that the largest coffee it can make is 7.7oz, even though Nespresso says this machine can make up to 14oz coffees. However, Nespresso has discontinued the Alto/XL pods that are required to make 14oz coffees, but they still say everywhere that they can make up to 14oz. The whole reason I decided to give Nespresso a try is because they very loudly market the fact that this can make large cups of coffee (like a Keurig can), but it's literally not possible in this machine because when it reads a barcode on each pod, it uses the amount of water that's recommended for that pod. So, without the Alto/XL pods (which no longer exist, but you won't see that update in any of their documentation or YouTube videos), you cannot make a coffee that's larger than 7.7oz unless you use multiple pods, which would be stupid because the pods are already more expensive than their competitors. Nespresso even has a YouTube video that shows how to make a large cup of coffee in this machine by manually programming the amount of water to use. I tried this with one of the other pods (not Alto/XL), and even though I kept my finger on the button like they said, it still stopped at 7.7oz. They should clearly say that you can only make a maximum of 7.7oz because they no longer support the 14oz pods.

Final thoughts:
I'm originally from Europe but I've lived in the US for a few years. When I go into a coffee shop in the US, it's most common to see people ordering at least 12oz or 16oz coffees. Tiny little coffees are great in Europe, but Nespresso is being really stupid for making the majority of their machines not cater for the US market, which is one of the biggest markets in the world for coffee consumption."

50,5.0,2022-05-21,기계 전용, 블랙,"I'll preface this review by stating that I am an espresso drinker. I have an automatic espresso machine, which I love, and that is the bar I used for my comparison. I will say that the coffee produced by this machine is as good as the coffee from my expensive espresso machine.

I like the option of a quick coffee for some variety. I have had Keurigs for years, and am probably on my 5th rendition. The more I drank espresso, the more dissatisfied I became with the Keurig. I found myself having to use 2 k-cups to get one cup of coffee strong enough for my liking. I then saw the nespresso online, and began to research the machine. Although there are minor complaints about it, the majority of reviews were positive, so I decided to buy one.

I was torn between the older model and the vertuso model. The attraction of the older model is 3rd party coffee pods, which saves money but after watching many a youtube review, it appeared the vertuso produced a better coffee with more crema. I opted for the vertuso plus deluxe. The deluxe model has a larger water tank and chrome accents.

The machine was simple to set up. Just fill the water tank, plug it in, make sure it had a container under the spout, and it went through a priming/rinsing cycle. The machine comes with 12 sample pods, each different. I immediately made a coffee and it was amazing! The flavor was excellent. It was more impressive than my expensive espresso machine (likely due to my choice of beans). I've since had several drinks from the machine and am pleased with each. The machine knows the right amount of water, brew time, brew temp for each pod, due to the bar codes. I no longer need to use 2 k-cups to get a decent cup of coffee, so the price per cup ends up the same as the Keurig. I spent about $.50 per k-cup, and each nespresso capsule is about $1. The brew time is longer than the Keurig, but shorter than my espresso machine (however, my machine grinds the beans for each cup).

I love this machine. I immediately ordered more sleeves of pods from nespresso's website. My order was shipped the next day and arrived 2 days later! Also, the machine comes with a $10 coupon for pods and you get samples with each order.

This machine is fantastic. I have given it 5 stars. It is worth the price, if you like quality coffee. Not even Starbuck's makes a better espresso! Buy it!"

Free samples, free gifts with orders and they send you recycling bags pre-paid labeling so u can recycle the pods. Not to mention it is very clean and precise. Im in love. I could also go on about the frothier. I use it for my cream, hot or cold BTW. It’s amazing"

I asked a friend of mine how he liked his and he surprised me with how quickly he said “I love it.”. We both went to Starbucks for our daily fix prior to getting one. I don’t want to mislead you but this isn’t a Starbucks espresso, if that’s what you are looking for. This is a very simple and quick fix for your espresso needs. I absolutely love it. I’m disappointed I didn’t buy it sooner."

56,4.0,2022-07-27,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This one is much better than the Next machine. However! - I did end up with a defective model with the first shipment. But - I called Nespresso and they actually replaced it with a new unit. Mine wasn't ejecting the pods, which apparently is a pretty common defect. Other than that, I hope you have a lot of $$$ for the Vertuo pods - since they might put you into bankruptcy. But since I love the espresso it's a luxury. The coffee though is bleh, you're much better off with a french press."

The different pods are automatically given the correct amount of water - so no guessing is inolved. Nesspresso pods coffee has much better flavor and mouth feels than the Keurig. We won't be purchasing another Keurig again."

It took several attempt to figure out the coffee machine. Now that I can open and close with pods, I don’t know how to control the amount or if that’s even possible. So it makes a small amount. It is nice to make a single “small” cup of coffee but like it said, small!!! For the price, would be nice to have more to a single pod. I tried all the flavors. Yum. Not one bad one. So 5-star for taste. I would like to send back the frother for replacement to get what I paid for. Wonder if I can but I tossed the box. Ugh."

Espresso, double espresso, cafe, large cafe, and a carafe. Plus it came with a frother for milk/cream. It’s a great value compared to buying an espresso machine and is easy to use.

Advice: read the initial setup instructions to flush the system and rinse everything. You can also use this to purge in the future. There is only one button on the device."
67,3.0,2022-07-24,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I bought the combo Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Milk Frother. The Frother was defective right out of the box. I am confident this was a QC over site. Three stars for now.

But this Nespresso machine is SO EASY to use! It makes impressive rich crema even for a regular coffee. The Vertuo capsules are more expensive than regular coffee, but it's definitely worth it. I was worried about the water leak since some people mentioned it in the review, but I haven't experienced any trouble at all so far. If you're considering it, I highly recommend it.

I contacted amazon & was told to contact Nespresso which I did. After 1 hour on phone with an offshore operator, we got the frother to work on the lower level but all it does with the full cup is warm the milk. this is no where near as good as the original frother and I am thinking about sending this one back to & changing machines altogether to another brand but I love the flavor of their coffees.

Read a few reviews that said the coffee wasn't hot, which held up my purchase, however it is every bit as hot as my Keurig. The milk frother is excellent, if you use half and half there isn't any liquid at all, all froth. As good as Keurig is, it can't hold a candle to this. Just making regular coffee it's great. A little pricey for a home brew, but a quarter of the cost as Starbucks, and is just as good, if you really get into it with flavors and technique, you can beat Starbuck's Latte's and cappuccinos hands down. If you're a coffee fanatic like me. you'll love this machine."
84,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,I am absolutely loving this nespresso machine. It is super covenant with the swivel water tank and can work on any space on my counter. I like how easy it is to remove the water tank as well (not awkward like a keurig). I do wish pods weren’t so expensive or nespresso would make reusable ones but overall I have no complaints. With the frother I honestly could live without it. It overflows easily and won’t just heat the milk. There is also no option for amount of froth.
85,4.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"I was disappointed that Nespresso has discontinued the Alto (14 oz) serving size ""pod"". I usually start my day with a 15 oz cup of coffee; now I have to use two 7.7 oz pods. This makes what is already the most expensive home-brew cup of coffee almost as expensive as Starbucks. Otherwise, I like the speed and convenience of the machine."
86,5.0,2022-06-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"I used to like coffee well enough, but I didn’t drink it often, I went elsewhere for my caffeine fix... but I tried a nespresso espresso years ago and never stopped thinking about it, haha.

I finally decided to treat myself and now I’m obsessed with coffee. I look forward to waking up to get my espresso fix, and sometimes I even sneak another cup when I get home from work. It’s just completely changed the game for me and I love that they give you a sample pack. The quality of the coffee is just incredible and I’m thrilled with it.

Those are the pros, but there are SOME cons.

This particular machine worked flawlessly the first couple of uses but now the button isn’t quite responsive and it takes a moment or two for it to start brewing. By that, I mean I thought maybe the water was low, so I went to fill it and half way through filling it the machine started brewing. It was a mad dash to turn it off.

Next, there’s the matter of the pods. More so the attainability and availability of them. Williams Sonoma sells the original line but for some reason Nestle hasn’t released the the vertuo line to them yet, which, suffice it to say, is stupid.

Shipping an online order directly from nespresso takes a minimum of 3 business days for my location, which, maybe I’m spoiled by amazon, but not a fan of that.

Aaaaaand, seasonal creations sell out FAST, so you gotta pay attention to those emails, folks. Don’t sit on them.

Also, Nespresso boutiques are hard to come by. I live in a major metroplex and there’s only one about 90 minutes from me. If they’re going to be stingy about how many locations they have, why not allow Williams Sonoma to handle some of that retail?

Bottom line, it’s DECADENT coffee but it’s a bit of a pain in the ass to obtain."

Unfortunately, the product is so good that we’re happy to pay for it. :-)"
93,5.0,2022-06-14,기계 전용, 그레이,"I waited to write this review after seeing some comments in other reviews that the machine enters a descaling mode and breaks about three months in. Well, I've had my machine since Christmas (gift to myself) and I've had no such problem. I've been enjoying my coffee ritual so much now that I also bought a milk frother, but not the nespresso branded one as that seems too expensive. I love that I can make any coffee drink I desire. I love the different size pods, and how you can program each pod size to brew a certain volume of coffee. My favorite pods are the alto pods, which is new with this machine. And I love that I can feel good about having ""pod coffee"" again with their pod recycling program.
Now, about descaling. Last week, I descaled my machine for the first time and had no problems and the coffee is back to tasting like new. I thought the machine would warn me when it needed to be descaled, but 5 months in I never got the warning and figured I better be proactive. I've been using filtered water in the machine, so maybe that held off some of the buildup. I find coffee tastes better with filtered water anyway.
But, the machine was getting noisier, and the coffee was starting to sputter when coming out of the spout, so I thought it might be time to descale. So I used one of their descaling packs and followed the directions in my manual. The machine did its thing and now I'm back to like new operation with less noise again and more flavor for about a week. I wonder if perhaps the problems people had are because the machine's setting lets the buildup get too bad before prompting you to descale.
Last tip is Nespresso has a wide range of coffee profiles, so I suggest trying sample packs (and always ordering your free 2-pack when ordering pods on the Nespresso site) to find the right flavor profile for you. I love this machine and love having my morning coffee now!"

The whole machine is such better quality than the Keurig. The way that it heats up the water so fast and disposes of the pod for you is amazing! It is SO a much more efficient than the Keurig. It’s a gorgeous design and the functionality is impressive. For the price, I cannot believe I hadn’t bought this sooner. It’s amazing!"

This is good when I am craving that good coffee in the afternoon or in the evening after the end of my work day. We have stopped craving Starbucks coffee because of this.
Love the ease of operation and the size. It is much smaller than a Keurig machine and looks great in the kitchen. Also I love that you can recycle the coffee pods by sending the used coffee pods to Nespresso in a postage paid envelope. I love this easy method. With Keurig, although you get recyclable pods, you have to separate the coffee, throw it in the regular trash and then dispose the remaining pack in the recycling bin. With this, you dump all the used pods in the postage paid envelope, pack it once its full and drop it at a nearby UPS.
The only downside if the cost of the pods. It comes to approximately a dollar to $1.5 per cup depending on the coffee and the deals/coupons you get. But this is gourmet coffee and something I drink only once a day (twice if I had a long day). For regular coffee, the instant coffee works for me.

Not only does it make hot foam but you can also make cold foam for your iced drinks. I definitely feel like a barista in my own kitchen! They also provided a sample pack of nespresso pods. It was kind of like coffee roulette. My husband and I would pick different pods and then determine which we like best. The only downfall I have noticed so far is the availability of the pods. A chunk that we did like or want to try were out of stock on the nespresso website and besides Amazon, the only place I have found them so far are at a few select target stores (I heard bed bath and beyond has them too but have not gone yet).

Review of Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi with Aeroccino, Grey
PROS
The coffee tastes better than starbucks or anywhere that makes it. It creates a frothy foam on the top of the coffee and really makes it an excellent cup. This is about 10x better than kureg as far as taste. Initial setup was easy out of the box. First cups were perfect and the machine made them without issue.
CONS
After about 2 months we have run into a few problems. The machine does not consistently work and continues to throw out the error code of ""no water"" or ""water container empty"" even when there is water in it. See the video for proof. After about 10-15 attempt it works and makes a cup. Luckily it doesn't reject the pod and it can be reused (even though it doesn't really even use it). Note this doesn't happen every time and usually it is the 2nd cup of the day that we end up fighting with the machine on. The other major complaint I have about this machine is precisely the way it tells you the error code. There is no display which code show a code. In stead you have to watch the flashing light and count how many red or green lights flash and how long they stay eliminated. Then you have to use the manual to look up the red/green code. Why can't you just have a $2 display that shows the status of the machine...WOW! What century are we in...lets make the error code reading as complicated at we can that way the user has to guess at the actual problem. Come on nespresso! Even a $5 calculator has a digital display. OK, back to the issue. As you can see on the video there is water in the carafe yet the machine continue to through an error. We are getting more and more frustrated by the cup. I will leave the rating at 3 stars but only because the coffee is so damn good.... when it does create a cup full.

UPDATE 5/11/2019
Ok. Now we are going down to 1-star (from 3). The machine makes the first cup every morning just fine. The 2nd cup NEVER works. The ""refill water"" light flashing comes on after you press the button to start the 2nd cup. I called customer service at Amazon and because we are over the 30-day window (actually 35) Amazon won't take it back. They patch me into Nespresso hot-line and then Nespresso wants to troubleshoot the problem, all over again. After talking to two people at Nespresso and arguing over what the red flashing light means and actually reading the manual to the Nespresso person on the phone she finally agrees to ""repair"" the machine. At first she wanted to ONLY send an empty UPS box so the machine could be sent to be ""repaired by a technician"". She told me that process would take about 2-weeks. I told her that was unacceptable and I needed coffee. She reluctantly agreed to send a ""loaner"" machine that we could use while our machine is ""being repaired"". After an hour with her on the phone I was ready to give up. It was apparent she had a ""protocol"" that she had to follow in order to reduce the returns and get customers to give-up because their customer service process is too complicated or there is too much push-back from the representative. I'm overall very disappointed with Nespresso and wish I would have purchased the machine at the local target. At-least then I could just take it back or buy another one and then take this one back. Nespresso you need to whole-heartedly stand behind your product for greater than 35 days and not give your customers the run-around. Think about how many people I'm going to tell about my experience with your product and the poor customer service. Also, add a digital display to the machine, it can't cost more than a free calculator display. A real code to read instead of a flashing light to count flashes like morse code would REALLY help your customers AND your customer service representatives in troubleshooting the errors...DUHH!"

109,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 레드,I bought this to replace my Vertuo Next which started leaking during the brewing process after about two years. This machine makes much hotter coffee than the Next and I like the automatic open/close mechanism. It's slightly larger than the Next but still fits well on my countertop. So far I prefer thus model to the newer Next.
110,4.0,2022-03-26,기계 전용, 블랙,I did not realize Nesspresso machine are made by different brands. The coffee taste good. The machine works very well and has a small footprint. The only negative is the cup stand it is not quite wide enough for bigger mugs and you have to be careful. The machine made by Nesspresso has a much better cup stand. This one is made by De' Longhi

Flavorful and hot every cup👍👍"
112,5.0,2022-05-07,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Just a week prior to this purchase I bought the original espresso only nespresso not realizing there was a version that brewed coffee. I quickly returned that purchase and bought the vertuoline.

There are two versions / manufacturers of the nespresso vertuoline--- 1) DeLonghi (this one) and 2) Breville. I chose the DeLonghi version exclusively for the swivel water tank feature. Aside from this functional difference they appear to be identical aside from design appearance. I'm really glad I went with this one as it really comes in handy having the tank on same side as sink. I've even moved the machine to opposite side and swiveled the tank to accommodate it.

Its important to note that this machine uses vertuoline size round pods ONLY. You cannot view the small espresso capsules. There is a line of espresso capsules that fit this machine however the selection is more limited than the original Nespresso line (it is however growing).

Before purchasing I read many reviews which mention a problem with the water temp being too cool. This comes down to preference- I would say this pumps out sufficiently hot coffee for my liking. I noticed the second consecutive cup brews a bit warmer than the first cup (maybe the machine warms up). Nespresso told us that you can prime the machine by brewing a cup of plain water first-- this hasn't been necessary -- my hubby prefers his coffee extra hot so I always brew my cup first and his second. He's had no complaints and doesn't need to microwave it for additional heat.

The frother is also great- Try using low fat or no fat milk for the best front. I tried half and half and it doesn't foam near as well. I wish the container had a lip to pour from but that's my only feedback.

I seen a Nespresso demo years ago at Target and I wish I had taken the leap sooner. In the bay area I had a daily Philz coffee 4$ day habit and I haven't been once since this purchase.

What? No offer for exchange. Wanted me to get other milk and have an on line “trouble shooting “ session. Not my idea of helpful. This is an expensive add on.

121,5.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"This is a wonderful machine for a great coffee experience. The Nespresso brand coffee pods are high quality, flavorful, and there is enough variety available to suit every taste. I haven't found anything that I don't like about the machine. I purchased the one with the milk frother because that is something that I enjoy.

Some of the reviews stated that the coffee was not hot. With the frother, you can froth your milk or cream. If you don't like froth, I would just microwave my cream in the coffee cup to heat it a little before brewing the coffee or just microwave the cup for a few seconds to take the chill off.

The Nespresso recycling program is especially easy and attractive for the consumer. The pods, in which the coffee comes, are aluminum. The company supplies free recycling bags which are already prepared with shipping label and shipping fee. All you have to do is put the used pods in the supplied bag, close (bag is self sealing), and drop at UPS. Easy peasy. When you order your coffee pods, if you need recycling bags you add them to your shopping cart for free. I love how this company has made recycling of their product easy and seamless for the consumer."

EDIT: Flavors, oh man, you have to try the Caramelizio, Bianco Leggero (over milk) and the Bianco Forte (over milk)

Makes good coffee, I'm still searching for the perfect flavor, but the machine itself is a work of art. I love the mechanical head lifting and how it disposes of the used capsule to it's container held in the back. It's actually pretty high-tech, so if anything malfunctions, there is an easy way to reset it without issue.

Your machine may need to be reset to its factory settings, to correct the amount of water dispensed through your capsules. To return to factory settings, we recommend the following steps:

Tap the lever upward, to eject any used capsule from the capsule chamber, then tap the lever downward, to close the head of the machine.
Push the lever down for approximately 3 seconds, until the green light goes out, to turn off the machine.
Press and hold the coffee button and lever down, simultaneously, for approximately 3 seconds, until the light is steady orange, then release the lever.
Press the lever down 3 times. The light should start blinking quickly in a pattern of 3 blinks and a pause.
Once the blinking pattern is established, press and release the coffee button.
The light will blink 3 times slowly, to confirm the reset, then turn a steady green."

Box was in good condition brand new, although when i opened it up & proceeded to open the top for first time there were already grounds inside machine.
Hadn’t looked used but took 5x to finally run clear.
I did call Amazon & they helped me with it initially & suggested I run it through the cleaning cycle several times. They were so helpful they even called nespresso & I talked with them while Amazon waited on other line.
In the end I did return this Nespresso because the pods did not slide off the prongs. It maybe slid off 5x if that. The machine worked fine produced hot espresso, quite, easy to use, didn’t take up a lot of space but for me that was also part of the intrigue
I did order a different nespresso machine have already received it & already using it.

First of all, there is one button, and one button only, that will flash to express what is happening. Fine, except there are about 40 different color/speed combinations and you need to figure out the difference between a fast blinking red light and a rapid blinking red light.
If you only want the same type of coffee every single day, this machine is perfect. There’s one button, and it’s easy and clean. However, if you ever want to switch the size of the cup you’re having or switch another function, it’s about an hour of clicking a single button, diagnosing a blinking light, and experimenting to see if you got it right.

137,3.0,2022-06-14,기계 전용, 그레이,"Based on reviews, I expected to obtain a superior cup of coffee. (I had been buying Starbucks.) It takes a while to sort though all the flavors to find one that is acceptable, not necessarily better than other coffee brands. Additionally, you have to get used to foamy coffee, similar to a latte. If you put cream or milk in your coffee, the coffee temperature may be too cool. The directions indicate that you should put the milk in first and stir the mixture when ready. However, I still need to put the cup in the microwave for 20 seconds to obtain a hot cup of coffee. Finally, the cost of the pods is more than I expected. Each pod costs $1.00 +. There is also a difference in the amount of coffee provided per pod. Unfortunately, the flavor my husband likes only provides a half a cup of coffee. You have to consider the flavor as well as the size of the pod in making a selection. He also has to add sugar to improve the flavor, which he had not needed to do before. Therefore, the cost-value benefit of this system may be an issue depending on your coffee preferences. I found that there are just too many usage restrictions and adaptations. I suggest that you view the YouTube presentations before buying or using this coffee system for the first time. There is a link on the Nespresso website. The videos are very good and will help in understanding how this system works. Additionally, Nespresso's customer service and delivery system are excellent. They do provide a wide variety of flavors and coffee types."

140,4.0,2022-06-12,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I purchased the Nespresso VertuoPlus and love it. My only complaint is the milk frothier is missing one of the whisks. Since I’ve been using the machine and don’t want to deal with the hassle of returning it I’ll have to reach out to the seller to see if they will ship a whisk to me.

I first tried Nespresso at my friends and liked it but wanted a larger quantity than an espresso. I didn’t know that there are machines that brew larger quantities, 8oz and 14oz.

Yeah it’s not as cheap as brewing a cup of coffee but I wasn’t doing that either. Instead I was buying a cup every day at work for $2. So for me it’s cheaper.

I have to say the coffee is much better tasting than Keriug, not sure if I spelled that correctly, and Starbucks.

The machine is very easy to use. Push up on the lever to open, the motorized lid opens, drops the spent pod at the same time, install the new pod, press down on the lever to close, and push the button at top to start.

The milk frothier is extremely easy to use. Pour in the milk to one of the two fill lines, close and press the button. Since I only have the one whisk I’ve only filled it to the lower level and frothed hot milk for hot drinks. I haven’t used it yet, but if you press and hold the button for 2 seconds you can froth milk for cold drinks. Hot the button flashes red and cold it flashes blue. Pretty smart.

If you are considering this machine, what are you waiting for?

Update 12/17/17: The instructions are not the most detailed, but I did notice that the provided whisk can be converted by removing the spring. In the lid there is a spring storage bracket when you are using the whisk without the spring. Therefore, the package came complete and I’ve upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I thought it was short one whisk."

143,5.0,2022-06-10,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I always wait to put up reviews because you should use the product for a while before posting to help buyers decide. I bought this machine almost a year and a half ago and it is great. We also bought the glass stand/capsule holder at the same time. We love coffee in our home and this machine is especially a plus when you have guests and everyone likes different coffees. It makes an easy fabulous cappuccino with the frother. We use a standard coffee machine to brew a pot of coffee every morning and use this for our afternoon coffee fix. I don’t think the pods are expensive considering they cost an average of $1.00 each and you can’t get an espresso or cappuccino for less than $3-$5 and a regular American cup for almost $2. You also have many pod options for strength and taste so there is something for everyone. It is definitely a good buy. Several of my friends have now bought this machine after having coffee at my place.
144,4.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이," The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi is my 2nd Nespresso machine. I purchased it almost six months ago and it has worked well for me.

The unit is much quieter than the Nespresso Pixie Espresso Maker I have and it heats up more quickly. For early morning use the Pixie is loud enough to wake up a light sleeper. That is not a worry with the new machine.

I like the option to make full size cups of coffee and the selection of pods that came with the machine was varied enough to help me find the flavors I enjoy best. I will keep using the Pixie for espresso until the Veturoline espresso sized pods find a lower price-per-cup.

I do think the price per Veturoline pod is high but that does not detract from the machine.

I have read some reviews about a problem with scaling. I only use distilled water in all of my coffee machines and although I have only had this machine for just over 5 months, I have used my 1st Nespresso machine almost daily for over 2 years and I have not experienced any scaling issues with it.

The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi is a good machine and with a fair price. It is easy to use and easy to clean and has a larger water reservoir than expected. If you are interested in trying the Veturoline pods I recommend this machine."
145,2.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This machine makes good coffee! I make the ice leggaro in it every day and it’s been amazing. My main issues come from the machine itself. It is already malfunctioning and I’ve not had it even HALF a year yet. I’ve had it maybe 2-3 months. When I put the pod in it won’t let me make the coffee. I’ll put the top down and it’ll continue beeping green so then I have to take the pod out and reinsert and I’ll have to redo this process 3-4 sometimes more until it works. This means I’ll have to take the back off so I can catch the pod before it goes with the used ones. It’s just a hassle and not what I expect from a brand new coffee maker. Today was the final nail for me writing this review as I opened the machine to make coffee today and yesterday’s pod got STUCK on top so I had to remove the back (which had only one used pod in it as I just cleaned it) and then it fell and I was able to put the new pod in and go through with the stupid putting it in, closing machine, having to reopen and catch the pod before it goes to the back, then replace it, hope it works or continue this cycle till it does.

It took me a very long time to choose a coffee machine and I'm glad I settled on this one. I no longer had (and still don't have) the time to use my Bialetti, so I needed something to get me good coffee fast and easy with minimum effort and that's what this machine gave me. Having read the reviews I was worried about leaking, but I thought occasional leaking was better than underheated coffee every time (like with some other Nespresso machines), because it at least can technically be fixed. But no fix needed, my machine does not leak a bit.
I like Aflorazio cups made with stevia and Nutpods vanilla oat creamer (I have a different brand of frother that I had purchased before my Nespresso) - makes great latte!

153,5.0,2022-04-13,기계 전용, 레드,"I bought this because my old nespresso machine (as in really, really old) is finally starting to give up the ghost. I always wanted the kind that made coffee too but they were simply too expensive in the past for me to consider.

Finally got one, and love it! I was a bit worried because apparently some of this line leak, but I have had zero problems with mine so far (I've had it about a week). I realized that because I usually make a morning latte that has two espresso shots in it (ie. two of the capsules) I would be better off with a machine that makes coffee too, so I got this one. I LOVE the coffee. Make no mistake: this machine is NOTHING like a keurig, and if you like keurig coffee, this is NOT for you. This machine makes strong, lucious coffee with crema on the top, which I love, and it also makes espresso. If you regularly go out for coffee at a place like Starbucks or somewhere else that makes fancy coffee drinks, you'll love this, but if you're after the kind of insipid drink that passes for coffee in a lot of the US, this will not be for you. I had given up on drinking drip coffee completely, because it's usually not strong/tasty enough for me, so I alternate between making a cold brew myself and this machine, and it keeps me going.

One small nitpick: I actually like the espresso from my old machine a bit more, because my old one had no auto-shut off, and I could adjust the strength of the espresso to my own purposes. I also prefer a bit less crema on my espresso than this makes. But it's a mild complaint.

I'm in love with this machine!"

This one came with a pod sampler pack which was delightful. I promptly used my promo code included in the box and ordered 50 pods. The pods are VERY expensive (80 cents to $1.80). Hopefully their patent expires and opens up more options eventually. A lot of reviews said the coffee maker was quiet, but i wouldn't call it that, you can definitely hear it and i would say that it's actually kind of loud. The milk frother is my favorite part - do not get the maker without the frother. Half and half works best, and it even heats up the creamer to a pretty hot temperature. If you're on the fence about getting this, i would say definitely expect to pay more for coffee overall, but it's the price you pay for getting into the Nespresso Club."

Full of flavor and BOLD and there are so many options to choose from when it comes to pods and picking out a flavor and delivery on Amazon in Los Angeles is same day delivery and you can order on the Nespresso app as well!

To me if you are questioning this machine and to a Keurig, just forget about the Keurig all together you'll be disappointed in the long run and will eventually buy a Nespresso machine.

Price break down for buying pods is $1.10 each when you buy 1 sleeve of 10 pods.

I haven't had any of the issues of the coffee not being hot enough, so not sure what those reviews are about.

The coffee produced has a sort of espresso style crema which I did not know was a thing (I'm not a coffee snob, I just like a solid cup of coffee). Pictured is my likely mishandling of the aeroccino, still trying to figure out how to get maximum froth.

168,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This is my first Nespresso Vertuoline machine and I love it. I got it on sale for $113 on Black Friday with the milk frother.

Let's start with the ease of use of this espresso machine. You press the top coffee button and the machine warms up, the green light becomes steady and it's ready to brew. Put in your favorite capsule and close the top lid and press the coffee button. Did I mention the motorized capsule lid? The lid opens and closes itself with a touch of the lever and disposes the capsules into its bin on the back of the machine.

Milk frother is even easier to use. Just pour the milk in and press the button. Adding the froth of milk makes you feel like a real barista! You can totally make the same exact drinks as they make at Starbucks for the fraction of the cost. And the drinks are super strong depending on which intensities you choose.

I paired this machine with double-walled coffee/espresso cups also purchased on Amazon. Much better than your everyday ceramic cups so you can see what you're drinking and the art you just created in the cups. I also purchased the storage drawer holder for capsules that stores the capsules and machine on top (see pics)!

170,5.0,2017-12-10,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I consider myself a Coffee Enthusiast. I care a lot about the quality and taste of my coffee. This coffee machine has made my everyday life tremendously more enjoyable. I am pleased with the features of this machine which include: easy access to the water tank, easy touch lever to put the espresso pod in, the fact that it includes the milk frother (big bonus), and that it makes great tasting coffee. Prior to purchasing this coffee machine- I did my fair share of research. Something that particularly stood out to me that made me want to purchase the product that made it unique to other coffee machines, is that it uses barcode recognition and a brewing extraction system. There is a different barcode for every different coffee type on each capsule and the machine adjusts the flow and volume of water, temperature, infusion time and capsule rotation to make the best coffee. This was an upgrade from my standard Keurig which simply just pushes hot water through the coffee grounds. This product has changed my life!"

I’m hesitant because of all of the reviews I’ve seen about having trouble later on, so I’ll be back to update my review if I have issues, but I’ve used it twice now and am very happy. I’m happy with the milk frother as well- it handles my milk alternatives well, which can be rather difficult. It froths oat milk like a dream! I do wish the sample coffees they send were labeled better so I could reorder the ones I like- it shows a picture of all of the coffees, not just the ones in the box, so it’s difficult to identify some of them."

175,3.0,2022-03-09,기계 전용, 레드,"Despite the negative experience with the first unit, I just bough the exact same model to replace it. But this time I bought the extended warranty. We'll see if I need it. The last one started having electrical troubles after a few months, but I was still able to use it. But it finally stopped working about two weeks after the one-year warranty expired. I suppose I should have sent it back before one year was up.
The unit is quite sturdy mechanically. It's a bit confusing trying to get it to run the descaling process every few months. That's partly when the electronics started acting funny. After that, the status light started showing half red half yellow when it should have shown green when it was ready to brew. But it still worked, so I ignored the incorrect light status."
176,5.0,2022-03-15,기계 전용, 그레이,I've been wanting to buy a Nespresso for a while and finally did it . We love it it comes with a few samples so you can pick what you like. I no longer go to Starbucks I have it at home .
177,2.0,2022-03-12,기계 전용, 그레이,"When this product actually works, it is great. The coffee is delicious, there's so much variety.

That said - I could not recommend this product. I gave 2 stars because it's actually a good product when it actually works, but our 1st machine and 2nd machine both started to leak internally.

PROS:
Easy to use
Coffee is delicious
Good selection of flavors on nespresso.com
The coffee pods are recyclable; nepresso.com even sends you self-addressed envelops to send back the used pods, free of charge.

Note: I've never used or tasted a Keurig so I can't compare with other similar machines. I've had the a Mr. Coffee for the past 10 years and only switched to Nespresso after glowing reviews (and an Amazon sale).

CONS:
Leaks after a few months!!! Our 1st machine leaked, our 2nd (replacment) also leaked!

We've bought the Nespresso Virtuo Plus back in December 2019 since it was on sale on Amazon.
After about 3 weeks, it started leaking at the bottom. It seems like the there was a clog somewhere inside the machine so coffee would get backed up and overflow. We did the recommended cleanings and descaling cleanings as well, but that didn't help.

We did an exchange with Amazon and got the replacement end of January 2020. It was working beautifully, we did the recommended cleanings as per the manual's schedule. It started leaking as well in middle of May 2020,, same issue as the 1st machine.

Since it's still covered under warranty (1-year manufacturer warranty), we called Nespresso customer support and they walked us through some troubleshooting (use a toothpick to pick out clogs, do a clean cycle with hot water) but it still leaks, so they are sending us a box so we can send back the Vertuo Plus so they can fix it and send it back. We are potentially without coffee for about 3 weeks so we will be using Mr. Coffee in the meantime to fill the void.

Honestly we are expecting the 3rd machine to eventually break, which is a shame because this is a great machine when it works. It's hard to go back to Mr. Coffee that we are willing to put up with this product as long as the warranty covers replacements but I do not recommend this product.

I think alot of the positive reviews are from users who may not have come back to update their initial 4/5 star reviews.

Please try googling ""Vertuo Plus leaking"" as well."

187,3.0,2022-02-14,기계 전용, 레드,"Good luck getting Vertuoline coffee anywhere else except Amazon. Your local big box stores don't carry it. What's Vertuoline coffee you ask? Well, it's these newer giant pods from Nespresso. When I bought this machine, I should have better educated myself, because these things are both rare and expensive comparably to K-Cups etc.

The good is that the coffee it does produce is excellent. Tastes good, high caffeine (if that's what you're into) and just works. It expels the pod neatly into it's little trash bin behind it, which is good for an office setting like ours. It also heats up relatively quickly compared to Kcup machines we've had in the past. It also uses aluminum pods, which for those BPA-phobic out there, I'm sure is a very good thing and perhaps worth the premium. Machine also looks good, is easy to clean, and works perhaps too simply, literally it's so simple that people get confused operating it.

The bad is expensive pods that are hard to find. Also we still haven't figured out how to get it to dispense just hot water for tea, hot cocoa, etc. When we do, it goes into ""cleaning"" mode and dispenses pretty much all the hot water.

Anyways, we got the machine on sale, it makes good tasting coffee so it's worth it for some. I wouldn't buy it again or necessarily recommend it for the simple reason you're locked into their rare Vertuo line crapola. If this somehow becomes as mainstream as Kcups, then cool, but I've seen no sign of that and quite honestly the opposite. For the price of the Vertuo line pods, you're pretty close to a cup at McDonalds/Sbux to begin with, so it's hard to justify the expense."

That being said, it produces an amazing cup of coffee! The espresso is as good as my $500+ Breville espresso machine with less preparation and clean up even with the dripping. The taste is way better than the Keurig I replaced with it although the Keurig was easier to use."

I wanted to see what all the hype was about and all I have to say is that I am not disappointed. So far I'm very happy with my purchase. My only mistake was I didn't pick a color, or didn't realize there was another color. I was expecting it to be all black but it's actually black and grey. This mistake is on me though. I was clicking around looking for deals for this one and the other ones I saw were black so when I picked this one I didn't even check.

All of my pours have been piping hot.
I've only had it a week but I'm in love. I was paying $4 a day for my coffee habit prior to purchasing this machine so the cost of the pods don't bother me and I really enjoy that there's essentially no clean up.

The only thing I've noticed that was a bit of a surprise is the temp of the output isn't as hot as I expected.

I was also impressed with the eco-friendliness of the pods and the built-in pod chute, so when you're making multiple cups at once it is much easier than a regular espresso machine! Pod sizes totally remove the guesswork and you get a stunning cup of coffee with a generous crema head on the top!

While it's nice that this machine has the option to make larger cups of coffee, I would send it back if my old one would magically work again. The reason: I like HOT coffee/espresso. It's true the coffee is warm enough (if you want to drink it all immediately), but it's not hot! In other words, if you want to make your coffee, pour it in a to-go mug, load your things in the car and take the trash out, by the time you pull out of your driveway, you will need to drink your coffee all at once if you want it warm at all. I like to linger over my coffee whether I'm driving to work or reading on a Saturday morning. Unless you like to linger over lukewarm coffee, this isn't possible. I would absolutely LOVE it if there was a temperature adjustment on this machine. I've had it 2 weeks and am debating about whether or not I want to return it.

I am very disappointed. I ended up ordering the exact same machine that I have at work (which uses *much* cheaper pods)."

But seriously, this machine makes some great espresso. Not as good as my friend’s $600 Breville auto grinder, but close enough without breaking the bank. I haven’t been as impressed with the flavor of the coffee sized pods, but the espresso and double espressos are fantastic. The coffees taste more like a regular Keurig, although maybe a little more flavorful. If I’m making coffee for 2 or more, I’ll do pour over, because it’s just better and not particularly messy. But when it’s latte time, this baby gets the nod. I do appreciate having the sizing options for coffee, and I’ll use them when I’m in a rush. Either way, this machine really gets me excited for the morning."

I know it's not conventional but there are very simple solutions to this problem. Aside from that, I've never had a problem with this machine. Immediately when you see the packaging, you know it's quality. Everything is beautifully packaged and the instructions are incredibly easy. Setting it up is also pain free and does not take long at all. It really is a beautiful machine. The motorized lid is amazing and the way that it automatically dispenses the capsule into the back bin is so convenient and elegant. I got mine in black and it's such a pretty sight. The milk frother is truly a thing on its own though. I get perfect, warmed, frothy milk in just a few minutes. I even use it to make hot chocolate and it feels like it was home-made on a stove. All in all, this is such an elegant machine that provides excellent hot coffee. And considering that it comes with the assortment, you can find the perfect strength and flavor that is right for you."

 My friend bought this a few weeks ago and hasn’t stopped talking about how great her coffee is...so, of course, I had to try it...she doesn’t share. She’s right. The coffee is wow. You get samples ( small samples) of the various types of coffee they offer so that you have some idea of which ones to order.
It is the easiest machine to use, looks great on my counter, and the coffee is delicious. I also love the fact that there is that real European coffee machine foam on top of every cup.
You press the lever,it opens by itself and tosses the used pod in a container attached at the back ( they will send you prepaid mailers to return and recycle the pods). Put in a new pod, touch the lever, it closes, touch the solid green light on top...and Voila, great coffee !"
253,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,"I like good coffee. I’m also 67, retired, and cranky. I’ve made good coffee using pour over (kalita and hario), French press, aero press, immersion, and auto drip (technivorm and baratza grinder). These days I want convenience as well as good coffee. I tried a Keurig for awhile. It was pretty finicky. Finding a keurig that didn’t make coffee that tasted like burnt plastic wasn’t easy. I’ve had an older nespresso machine, and liked their espresso. Decided to finally try their newer combo machines. I’m very impressed. Very easy to use, and the coffee and espresso are very good. Lots of choices with regard to drink sizes and roast strength.

Some things to consider.....when you buy this machine, you must use nespresso capsules. Capsules are easy to get on Amazon, or you can order them directly from Nespresso. The cost per cup, compared to other methods of preparation, is high. To me, it’s worth it. Only you can make that decision for yourself."

**New Review Dated 7/28/2020**: I gave this a 1 star review a few weeks ago. I contacted Nespresso company and they immediately sent me a box and fixed the machine and sent it back within a reasonable amount of time, which deserves a better review for resolving the issue with competency."

I filled the reservoir with water and ran an initial startup cycle. I brewed one of the sample packs of double espresso, which tasted great and was plenty strong. I then unboxed the included milk frother and noticed it was missing the lid. I contacted amazon and they provided assistance reaching out to Nespresso in order to get a replacement lid.

I have used keurig for years before this and I am disgusted in myself that I ever thought that was coffee. Yes you will have to throw a handful of money at this machine right away but the prices you will spend to make your coffee at home instead of the drive thru is dramatically lower over the long run.

269,2.0,2022-07-28,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"This model has some annoying design flaws:

-- There is a variable delay after pressing the brew button without any visual indication that the button press got things started. So you're left wondering if you pressed the button hard enough, or maybe need to press it twice just in case.. until the coffee starts.

-- Sometimes the pods get stuck on the rails while sliding back into the pod container.

-- The pod container is solid black and can't see what's inside, until it's completely full and it is overflowing.

Now after about 6 months it started leaking somewhere internally and won't turn on anymore.

I see much better reviews on the older model Vertuo Evoluo (ENV135GY). That one has a transparent pod container on the side. I'm going to try that model as a replacement.

Nespresso needs to make better machines. Nespresso Vertuo produces a superior tasting coffee compared to Keurig, but unfortunately the new Keurig K-Supreme Plus blows this away in quality, features, and overall design."
270,5.0,2021-03-22,머신 + 에어로, LE 블랙 매트,"This is a great machine. It makes my espresso daily my wife coffee and decaf. I appreciate that it automatically detects whatever type of pod is inserted and adjusts the water accordingly. The used pods are recyclable, so we just bag them up and send them back to the manufacturer (free postage), so this product generates no trash beyond the packaging it ships in. It’s easy to clean and maintain; we’ve had no problems in 8 months of daily use.

The pods cost about 85 cents each, which is a little more than the grounds for a conventional espresso machine, but it takes no time to prepare or clean up. We’re all busy, and no one wants to spend three minutes washing coffee grounds out of all the crevices of their machine. This simplicity, speed, and cleanliness makes the Nespresso a great value."

272,5.0,2022-03-15,기계 전용, 그레이,"The only difference between this machine and the $500 coffee maker is that the coffee isn't ”freshly” grounded right before your cup of coffee. That's it.

Save your self the time and money. The expensive coffee machine gives you the feeling of making a better expresso coffee but you really aren't. Nespresso capsules are actually very fresh and sealed in aluminum for freshness so Dont mix it up with the k cups, which are in plastic. The freshness and the brew of this coffee maker is side by side with the $500+ coffee machines.

Except this is much easier and faster to use. They took a $500+ coffee machine, made it simple and faster to use with coffee ready to go in capsules with the perfect size of coffee printed on the barcode on the capsules themselves. And made the whole machine affordable to everyone."
273,1.0,2022-03-25,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"You have to ask yourself... Do you feel lucky? It seems that the seals on some of these that fit the top of the coffee pod randomly go hard and crack letting the coffee escape as the pod is spun. You'll know if you're one of the unlucky few if you start getting coffee down the back of the machine and all over your counter. If you're really unlucky like me, it will be just out of warranty and they'll want $125 to fix it or they'll give you a discount on a new one after accusing you of being the problem because you didn't clean the machine ONCE A WEEK. Who does that?. In any case, neither is really an acceptable solution to what is definitely a design flaw. My old Tossimo worked for 11 years and I only switched to this machine because I couldn't find the pods for that one anywhere anymore. So, my recommendation is to run in the other direction. Buy a different model, buy a Keurig, buy a drip coffee maker... Or if you're feeling lucky, roll the dice. I wish you luck!

Update: I liked the coffee enough that we rolled the dice and bought a new Virtuoline Next machine. This machine is engineered MUCH BETTER. They basically gave-up on trying to stop the system from leaking and just engineered the new machine to manage the leaks. Now, any leaking flows into a little cup under the spent pod storage. So, even if the machine leaks, at least it won't get all over your counter like the VirtuoPlus machines do. Basically, in my mind, this is an admission that the VirtuoPlus machines have a major leak issue, and their refusal to acknowledge this or address it a few months past the warranty is poor business. Run away from this particular model. Buy a VirtuoNext. You'll lose the motorized lid, but you won't miss it, and you'll save yourself a ton of mess and money when the machine inevitably starts leaking."

Interesting that it senses the size of the coffee/espresso pod that you insert. So there are bigger vertuo pods for coffee and smaller for espresso.

The Nespresso machine has excellent coffee capsules and works way better than any keurig I've ever used. It even came with like sampler 10 pack of capsules to try their popular flavors.

If you’re thinking about buying this, get it. If you think they’re expensive, they’re not. Each coffee is around $1.

-The machine is much quieter

-One touch to warm up (fast) and brew

-Completely customizable cup volume from 2 through 14 oz (a basic idea lost on Caffitaly or Starbucks)

(btw I would not pay more for the ALTO 14 oz pods - the more intense regular sizes seem to stretch to 12 oz + and still give you a great cup.)

-Water tank you can grip in one hand, lift off, and refill easily

-One touch powered mechanism to drop a pod in

-Used pod box you can lift out with one finger and empty

- ALL THE WATER ENDS UP IN YOUR CUP - none in the pod box, or anywhere else.

304,2.0,2019-03-23,기계 전용, 레드,Received my Nepresso machine and the box looked like it had been returned before. Very taped up. I was missing the adjustable cup support. The instructions were for different model then was sent.
305,4.0,2019-09-02,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Thought I was buying twin to same set I bought at a store. The materials this set is made from is clearly cheaper. More plastic parts...no wonder it was less $$$ than store. The aeroccino isn’t the same quality either. It’s lid doesn’t fit as snug. It works fine but doesn’t feel as solid or that it will last as long. Bought for use in seasonal home.

Machine and its coffee is expensive but in our house its 3 of us and in the long run we actually save.. anyway, it works great, very easy and simple to use. Makes great espressos and coffees. Ive tried most of their coffees and almost like them all."
307,4.0,2022-02-09,기계 전용, 레드,"It was louder than I thought it would be when brewing coffee so I had to put it on a thick non-slip mat to decrease the vibration on my counter or it would wake people up. The coffee pods are expensive but the coffee is wonderful- flavorful, aromatic and with a perfect foam on top."
308,2.0,2020-07-08,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"In terms of convenience and flavor this is great, but it started leaking just outside of warranty period. Would expect from a $50 coffee maker, not $150+."

Bad enough packages are always at risk of disappearing...why invite thieves with such an inviting billboard? I would recommend you present an offer, on the check out screen, to put such orders in non descript shipper as you did for a relatively inexpensive metal storage rack I purchased a while back.
Seems like a no brainer to me. Please consider."
310,2.0,2022-02-28,기계 전용, 레드,I’ve had this machine for a year. It is glitchy in the cleaning and descaling process. It went into descaling mode two months after its first descaling. It won’t run through the descaling and rinsing mode according to the directions. It’s been more trouble than worth for espresso less good than my old stovetop espresso pot. Not worth the money nor the hassle.
311,2.0,2020-07-30,기계 전용, 타이탄.,It was working well. Needed to be cleaned so we cleaned it. And it still wasn’t working well. Would only let a small amount of coffee out of the machine at a time and won’t give us a full cup.
312,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 레드,This thing is amazing! I’ve used it every day for the last month. Have not had any issues. Stopped using my plain old coffee maker now that I have this. Each coffee pod cost around one dollar which is relatively cheap so I’m not sure what people are talking about when they say the pods are expensive because a bag of ground coffee would essentially end up costing you about the same thing for how many cups of coffee you get out of it.
313,5.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Very impressed with the quality in such a small machine. Although the first one was defective and we got a replacement, it was worth the wait!
I bought this for the office and everyone enjoys a hot coffee or a shot of espresso every morning before we all start our day. This definitely replaced all the coffee we buy everyday that are expensive. Good investment to save money

Now I’m thinking of buying the same machine at home to use during my day offs."

I made my first espresso and I couldn’t see the cup filling up but after a few seconds I noticed that all the coffee was being dispensed from the bottom of the machine. I’m not taking about a small leakage here, the entire cup of coffee came from the bottom. I tried again just to see make sure that it’s actually a flawed machine and the second time also the same thing happened. Sadly, I have to return it."
316,5.0,2019-04-18,기계 전용, 레드,"For the longest time I was faithful to my Keurig until my manager bought one of the for our office this past Christmas. I was reluctant to try it because I have food allergies but when I eventually did, I could not go back to K-cups. The flavor is an improvement, the caffeine is more potent, and the cream doesn't irritate your stomach. I bought this for my home to replace my Keurig and I do not regret that decision for a second. My wife enjoys the foam that some of the capsules provide as a finishing touch. I could recommend this Nespresso more and it's a must buy."

The milk frother is an awesome feature also. The only down fall would be the cost of the replacement pods and the fact that most stores do not carry them. With that said, still as good or better and less expensive then Starbucks... Yes ... I said it..."
326,5.0,2019-08-20,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I have been wanting an espresso maker for a while, and I'm super glad I splurged a little and got this one! It's very easy to use, takes very little time to heat up the water and make my espresso. It can also be used for regular cups of coffee as well. The store bought pods are little pricy, but you can always buy a refillable pod. Totally recommend this!"

330,3.0,2021-09-22,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,We loved our Nespresso Vertuo machine for a year and some change. But then it gave us the solid red light of death in the middle of a descaling session. Support couldn’t help and all the online chatter points to this being a problems for many Vertuo owners. I’m sad because I love the coffee and thought it was saving me money…but not if I have to replace it every 1.5 years.

333,5.0,2021-10-14,기계 전용, 그레이,"This was my first “like new” purchase. It came in the original packaging and clean. The only thing that I could complain about is that some of the free pods that came with it were missing but I did not think it was a big deal. It also makes the best coffee! I could never go back to having a keurig.
Tip: you can order pods from nespresso and get free recycling bags with postage on them so nespresso can recycle them."
334,5.0,2020-10-27,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I’m a huge coffee lover having multiple cups a day every day. This has been the best investment I’ve made. I’ve had a standard drip coffee maker, a Keurig, and a Ninja Coffee maker and this one is far and beyond better. The flavor and depth of the coffee is amazing and as a black coffee lover this is much more robust and flavorful. Most regular drip coffee makers can’t hold a candle to the Nespresso. I’ve also enjoyed the aeroccino machine for both hot and cold foam milk when I’m feeling fancy. I highly recommend this machine."

I think the Nespresso pods are the best pod coffee, both the original and the vertuoplus, and I like that they’re metal, not plastic being subjected to heat as with Keureig pods. There are tips, such as run 1 cup of water first to ensure it’s hot enough. It’s really about the coffee as a good machine with bad coffee makes bad coffee and for the price, this is great."

The flavor, taste, and overall quality is like no other. I’ve now had this for two months and every morning after my first sip I thank the coffee heavens I made the switch!! If you’re thinking about getting one I highly recommend it. You won’t regret it!"
339,5.0,2021-12-09,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"We had several Keurig machines before we bought this one. The keurig is fast but had poor coffee flavor. The Nespresso has far and above the best coffee flavor when compared to the keurig. The only downside is the coffee is more expensive and as we enjoy it more, we have needed to purchase more coffee. We give this machine 5 thumbs up."
340,2.0,2021-10-29,기계 전용, 레드,"I had used the previous model for about 3 years making about 2 cups of coffee a day before it broke down. I order the latest model and after about 10 cups of coffee, the lid locked up with a red error light and the coffee make broke down.

341,5.0,2020-10-18,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"This machine makes great espresso, but not a geat cup of coffee. When brewing a 7.7 oz pod you end up with a full cup of espresso. I went back to my Ninja coffe maker, but use the Nespresso when I want a nice cappuccino or latte. The frother works great and is quick and simple. I use it to make hot chocolate sometimes. Pods are expensive so I use my Ninja for coffee in the morning and have a cappuccino from my Nespresso. The Nespresso heats up quick and is easy to use. Still trying other drinks."

343,1.0,2021-04-07,기계 전용, 블랙,"Bought this for Christmas in December 2021, it lasted for 5 months. I saw similar reviews and was hoping there was just a defective few but nope! Same descaling situation as everyone else. I used every descaler on the market from Nespresso, etc. Just flashes red and shuts off. Worked great the first month, noticed less crema and the flavor was lackluster as the months went on, then it just died. I heard their warranty was good so I reached out via email, never heard back. It’s been a month now since reaching out. Basically, even tho Keurig isn’t as fancy, I’d go with that at this rate. Paying for a supposedly great Nespresso machine, paying over the top for hard to find pods, for it to last only 5 months and EVERYONE is having similar issues? Yeah, not worth it."
344,1.0,2021-12-21,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"I bought the machine in used, like new condition. From my understanding this would mean that it was purchased then promptly returned but still in perfect working condition. This was NOT the case. It was missing the Welcome Manual (with a contact number for Nespresso) and the machine is broken. I followed the instructions manual precisely but when I insert a pod and press start it blinks red two times then back to green. According to the manual this can be fixed by ensuring the water is full and checking that the pod is inserted correctly. Both of these things were already happening and it will not work. I’m so irritated that I have to package this huge thing back up and return it."
345,5.0,2022-07-13,기계 전용, 레드,"It heats up quickly, is easy to refill, and the coffee is so delicious that every single cup takes me back to the first time I had a great cup of coffee. I also really like that when you return used pods to Nespresso, they compost the coffee and recycle the aluminum. You can get pre-paid envelopes from Nespresso.

The pods are a bit expensive (about $1 a cup) but I feel so much better about using this than K-cups that it seems worth it. Plus, $1 for a cup of delicious, foamy coffee seems reasonable!

The pods themselves are kind of beautiful, so I also got the stand with the glass top with a drawer in it. I purchased this machine in red (who wouldn't want the red!?) because it was cheaper. It's a good-looking machine."

We recently switched to this Nespresso machine because I like the taste of the coffee better and love the crema made on top of the coffee. The only downside to this coffee maker is the pods are not readily available in your standard grocery store and can only be purchased online or at a Nespresso store, which is about 45 minutes away from me. I just have to plan well and order my coffee online before I run out. Otherwise, love this machine, love the coffee and love the aeroccino to froth my milk!"
349,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,It can make from an espresso to a large coffee. I prefer Intenso for a strong cup. However there are plenty of choices in capsules in all sizes and strengths. That's the beauty of this machine.

It has been 2 weeks and I haven't heard anything about it, so I called and was told that it is now going to take 4 to 6 weeks. This is very disappointing since it was not even a year old machine. I was told that Nespresso offers loaners but for some reason the company said they can't send me one because they have none to give out. I am now left with lots of coffee pods and no machine. Not good costumer service. They actually offered me coffee but i would have to pay for it wow as im telling them i have no machine."

Three months later that one broke and they wanted me to send it in for repair but I asked for a new one and they obliged. Five months later that one died. I am waiting for their box to send it in for repair, but this is nuts. Three machines in a year!!!!! I am so bummed. If you do purchase this, open an account with Nespresso on their website so you get the great customer service. Plus, when you buy pods from them directly, they send you free stuff to start and free samples every time, plus you can only get the recycle bags from them directly. Free shipping over $100, scheduled delivery, and you can return unopened packages. I hope they get it together ... but when this one dies, I am done. Good luck."

I had a Keurig previously, and there is no comparison to the creamy flavor of Nespresso coffee. I tried the Elvazio from the included sampler. Very nice. I also love that you can program each pod flavor to your specific needs, so if you want a bigger cup than the pod factory set, you can change it...just keep in mind that more water equal less intensity.

No calories, no dairy, no regrets, no fatigue, no missing out. I know it sounds like I’m sponsored but unfortunately I’m just at the point in my life where I get very excited about things like appliances.

I have examined the source of the leak and am sure it's the base, not the drip tray and not the water resevoir. I have run a cleaning cycle and rinse cycle, nothing helps. Registered the machine with Nespresso and called for help. Was told that the technical service line was busy and someone would call me back -- never received a call back. I did read reviews of the machine leaking and I'm now adding to those reviews. Rating of 2 stars for the great coffee."

Nice product, however; when it arrived it had NO manual to explain how to use it, AND it was in a box sloppily packaged without proper support to hold it in one place while shipping. I'm glad it wasn't broken by the time it got to us."
388,2.0,2021-12-01,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I bought this a year ago - it makes ok coffee / espresso. The coffee has a thick foam on it which I know some people like, but I found black coffee with a thick layer of foam kind of odd. It also takes forever to close the lid. It's automated so when you push it down you have to wait for it to slowly close on its own. And wait. And wait.

But the BIGGEST ISSUE... It now leaks coffee out the back - not water, COFFEE! I have to stuff the machine with paper towels to keep the coffee from running all over my counter and it only brews about half of the cup - the rest spills out of the back into paper towels. It's a mess and I'm going to contact the company but if they can't fix it, it's going into the trash.

Made OK coffee for a year. 2 stars because it did its job for awhile.

Don't buy this one."

This machine has a great range of flavors which differ greatly from each other. I highly recommend getting a reliable brother as well for your sweetened cream or milk which adds a great new dimension to your coffee. I used to get $6 dollar coffees from my local shop many times a week, but after buying this I only ever grab one if there is a special and I'm out. The quality is extremely high, especially if you are willing to find a great creamer to accompany the coffee."

I like the variety of flavors to choose from and the easy coffee order and gifts we get from Nespresso. Now, the aerocino frother is worthless. I followed the suggestion of heating up the milk before putting in the frother, but it was too much work. I don’t use it anymore. I just put half and half on our coffee and some sugar free syrup and we are good to go!"

394,1.0,2021-07-30,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"It does a great job and the espresso and frother both work well ... BUT they charge you $1.10 per pod which is absolute extortion. I work from home and drink 3 - 5 cups per day Monday - Friday. So the simple math is that this coffee cost me between $780 - $1,300 per year based on 3 - 5 cups per day, with 260 workdays a year.

If you pay $400 more up-front for a real espresso machine with frother, the taste obviously won't be compromised. In fact, you will have a much wider variety of coffee selections and strength options available to you. But more importantly, the coffee will only cost you about $375 per year max for higher end coffee choices - and more cups in a day. So the higher costing machines pay for themselves well within a year, and then the savings goes on for all future years.

You can opt to use the $900+ per year savings on something far more intelligent. That is of course unless you actually like paying well over double what you should for the barely noticeable convenience of a pre-packed pod (takes me 30 seconds). This company is clearly focusing on taking advantage of the sloth and/ or math challenged."

They wanted me to send it back, they'd check it out, fix it - THE SAME MACHINE - and return it. You know, about one or two months, right? No espresso machine, no replacement... just have their ""technician"" tinker with it. Asked to speak with the supervisor, but because this company call was in the CARRIBEAN, no supervisor was to be found. ""We'll call you back."" Right. So because this company made its nonexistent service satisfaction known, we just want to get rid of it and purchase elsewhere. So we began the long, arduous process to return to Amazon... and y'all know how tricky that can be when it is beyond the 30-day window. But all is well now. This piece of expensive junk is on its way back, we are being refunded and can shop for a replacement, This company (apparently owned by Nestle) gets an F for customer satisfaction, while Amazon gets our Appreciation for taking care of our return and refund."

What I didn’t pick up from the information is that you have to buy separate pods in order to get a bigger or smaller cup. I mistakenly thought the amount of coffee dispensed was a function of a setting on the machine.
The machine is easy to use. Based on other reviews, I will bring the water to the tank and fill it versus removing the tank to fill. Hoping that way the chance of leaking is lessened.

So my Nespresso supposed to be used but it's an open box one so it's like new. I got it for about $100 and the regular price for the new one is about $180 so I save almost $80 and it came with the milk frother and a sample set of Nespresso pods. I'm a huge coffee drinker and with everything locked down and I'm really enjoying making my coffee at home."
409,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,"This makes a great cup of coffee and espresso. The temperature if perfect---hot. The creamy froth with each cup is perfection. It was easy to operate immediately on arrival. Other reviews had mentioned water leakage as a problem, but I have experienced none of this yet. I purchased the system for my office. It is a great midmorning and midafternoon indulgence. Now I wish I also had one for home use. I appreciate the used pods recycling option as one of my biggest concerns with this type of system was adding to the landfill. I prefer very robust coffee, and the IntensO coffee and the DiavolittO espresso are my favorites, but even the less robust samples have been very enjoyable. My husband prefers a decaffeinated coffee and reports the Decaffeinto IntensO espresso is excellent."

I use the frother whisk without the coiled wire attachment for the perfect amount of milk/froth.

So far, zero issues with leaking or any mechanical problem. I am very satisfied with this purchase. If you sign up on the Nespresso website, where you can order future pods, you can get some ""freebies"" on your first three orders. After my first 75 cups made, it should pay for itself!"

Also...make sure you read up on Nespressos ratings of the coffee and what the numbers mean. They stand for Intensity and bitterness level. We tend to like the lower numbers.

415,1.0,2019-02-12,기계 전용, 블랙, I was so excited to get my first nespresso. I didn’t realize the capsules/pods weren’t ejecting out by itself. Sometimes I have to stop it halfway for it to catch up to the rods and then lift it all the way up. For the amount of money we spend it shouldn’t be this much work. And sometimes that doesn’t even work. I exchanged for another one and it happened again. People had said you can bend the rods but it’s brand new and I did not want to mess with that. Very disappointed so I got the order version instead.

There was too much crema and when the Nespresso ( just a lucky try) did make a larger cup of coffee, it was watery and tasteless. I thought this machine would be great for me because I can never make a good cup of coffee on my own. It turns out the Nespresso was no better than a cup I make myself."

I ordered a week earlier for a party I was having. Well a week later no coffee. No store has it. So if you dont have another machine for a plan B , you have no coffee. Thats what happened to me.

The coffee flavors we’ve tried so far are amazing and the froth the machine creates on top adds a touch that makes the coffee seem smoother. The Aeroccino milk frother is something I thought of as a gimmick at first adds the fancy cafe/coffee shop topping that I didn’t know I was missing.

However, upon first use, which is a cleaning cycle of water only, a very large puddle under the machine appeared.

When making coffee this becomes even more apparent due to the brown color. I’ve contacted Nespresso through their store here in the hope of a remedy (really want to have a non-leaking machine). Otherwise I’ll have to reach out to Amazon for a refund.

I will update this review with information regarding Nespresso’s customer service and “fix” or Amazon’s response if I need a refund after all is said and done.

***UPDATE*** Contacted Nespresso by phone after no reply to email. Support person walked me through poking a paper clip in over flow hole and filler spout. Still leaked.

453,4.0,2021-01-07,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,Very happy with this coffee maker and milk frother! Haven’t had any problems with either of them so far and been using consistently for about 2 months. I will say to make sure you use a large coffee mug when making coffee and adding frothed milk. I didn’t have a mug big enough so I had to get a “latte sized” mug. The mug platform on the coffee maker is pretty small so you have to hold your mug on it the entire time your coffee is brewing. All in all I’m very happy with this product!

It doesn't take a math genius to figure out that at about $1 per brew, this thing saves you tons of money over overpriced seattle coffee chains. While they sell their upscale brews for what? 4 or 5 bucks? you get better quality in each brew out of this machine for $1. That is golden arch price for better than seattle overpriced quality. Stop reading and go buy one of this machines."

I always use filtered water. Lately, it has been making a clattering sound and stops working until I unplug and plug it back in. It is a bit of a pain.

Only issue is that the since the coffee has to be purchased in pods it is inaccessible for last minute purchase and also ends up more expensive than any other coffee machine where you could grind your own beans or buy ground coffee to brew. I suppose the cost is offset by the fact that the coffee is of good quality and is less expensive than chain coffee shops."

Nespresso says a descaling process should be done after 600 pods, i dont think mine made it to 250. I am very angry and disappointed and have no plans to buy another Nespresso product in the future."

Love the way used capsules are lifted up and out of the capsule holder and slide down into the capsule container at the rear of the Nespresso.

No fuss, no muss!"
479,2.0,2021-12-18,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"This machine does make tasty coffee. For that it gets more than one star. But our machine broke within the first two months of light use (approx. 40 capsules in). Our machine started leaking coffee down the back of the machine, into the used capsule container, initially hiding but ultimately creating a mess following every use.

Trying to get it fixed was, unfortunately, very challenging and still ongoing. Instead of making it fast and straightforward to provide a replacement, Nespresso has a Byzantine customer service process that requires calling in (long hold times, with no monitoring of email), and eventually led to Nespresso sending a box for shipping (1 week), agreeing to evaluate and attempt to repair it (4-6 weeks), and then either sending a repaired machine or replacement (additional 1 week). We are mid-process, and this is taking in excess of TWO MONTHS, during which, we are without the coffee machine.

Our experience would be substantially better if the machine hadn't been defective and, more importantly, if Nespresso had a more expeditious method of replacing defective products."

However, I was soon disappointed. The coffee temperature is MUCH lower than the original machines. I believe this is a known, due to the type of brew process (not using pressure but centrifuge instead). In fact, if you read the user manual troubleshooting guide, under the 'Coffee is not Hot Enough' section, it tells you to pre-heat water before putting it into the container. Im still suprised that I pay >$100 for a coffee machine, and still have to use my microwave to get HOT coffee. Also its impossible to buy Vertuo capsules in stores. And buying from Amazon, you can only buy a 30-pack quantity. My advice is to buy the Original model Nespresso machine, and get 'coffee' pods, instead of pure espresso pods."

When it finished brewing the cup was overfilled and spilling everywhere. I didn't add anything to the cup before adding the espresso so I know that it brewed double the amount that it should have. It doesn't give me the option for choosing a brew size so I know I didn't pick the wrong capacity. I tried it again with a capsule that was meant to brew 2.7 fl oz and it filled a third of the same cup so I am left to believe it is my machine that is working incorrectly. I am feeling really frustrated because I was excited to use this for the first time but I am extremely disappointed in the way that it brewed my coffee.

534,5.0,2021-07-16,기계 전용, 그레이,It took me a bit to figure out what coffee I liked from nespresso. They are stronger than what I usually drink. Once I got the hang of the machine and what coffee pods I liked it was fine but I found the directions very vague and the coffee description extremely vague for flavors and such.. it really is trial and error till you find the taste you like
535,5.0,2019-07-09,기계 전용, 그레이,"So this is my second Nespresso Machine. I have the Vertuo Bundle at the house and this one at the office. I like how simple the design is, I like how the cups are ejected into the back, I like the swivel water reservoir. I also, was surprised that the the top is motorized...when you go to put the capsule in you click up and the motorized top opens...you put in the capsule and click down once and it closes automatically...impressive...great quality..."
536,2.0,2022-09-18,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,After a couple of weeks I noticed water pooling under the machine. The coffee is subpar and overpriced. Regret purchasing and not returning.
537,3.0,2021-06-19,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I owned to Bosch tassimos, but after changing my location last time decided to go with something new. Both coffee machine and capsules are questionable. First one I ordered full automatic was broken, and after reading a lot of similar problems decided to order manual cappuccinatore(not working well at all, I have used a better ones). I cant say coffee is bad but hardware+capsules overall experience is not grate. I'm just writing this for people who already owned Tassimo before like me to do not even try. In terms of reliability will see but already feels half broken)"
538,3.0,2021-03-29,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"The brew button is unresponsive after four months. I've sent it back twice and it still doesn't work. They are trying, but I can't give a review to something that seems like a lemon.

When it works, the coffee is great. That's what stinks about writing a negative review."
539,5.0,2019-12-09,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This is my second Nespresso machine and I love it. It’s quiet, easy to use, and doesn’t take up a lot of counter space. The milk frother is perfect! I actually stopped going to Starbucks because I like my Mocha Cappuccinos better than theirs! I use organic milk, Truvia and of course Nespresso espresso pods. This machine was on sale before Christmas and I couldn’t resist. My 5 year old Nespresso machine is in our pantry in the event we may need it. Great deal!"
540,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 + 에어로치노 + 캡슐 세트, 잉크 블랙.,When our old coffee pot died I decided to upgrade. Best decision ever. It very to use and coffee options are huge.
541,5.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This is the most amazing coffee machine I have even seen. It makes the best coffee EVER! I would never pay this much money for a “coffee machine” but this is SO MUCH MORE. The coffee machine produces an amazing frothy brew, and the milk frother turns every cup into a treat. This is the best money I have spent in years!!!"
542,5.0,2021-05-19,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Super glad I purchased this item. The only downside at the moment is only being able to use Nespresso brand coffee pods which I wish I would have known prior to purchase.
543,5.0,2022-09-19,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I love everything about it. It’s very easy to use and makes terrific lattes.
544,5.0,2020-11-26,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Coffee is delicious. I stopped buying coffee by the cup. I even look forward to getting up in the morning just for the coffee!!
545,5.0,2018-01-19,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"We love this coffee maker! My husband was skeptical when our Nespresso first arrived. It took him less than a week to tell me to get rid of the Keruig. I used to say I wasn’t a coffee drinker, I added coffee to my cream and sweetener. I can drink Nespresso black, it’s that good. The frother makes great foam if that’s your thing. I bought another machine to give to my Starbucks loving DIL for Christmas. She too, is hooked on Nespresso now"
546,5.0,2018-12-14,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"Machine is overkill for espresso, BUT, and this is a huge BUT, if you want a terrific 8 oz or 15 oz cup of unparalleled coffee, this machine is way above terrific. And other reviews aside, the pods can be resealed using your coffee and “MY” brand foils!!!"
547,3.0,2020-01-02,기계 전용, 그레이,"Really like this machine, but after about 6 months it stopped making hot coffee. I've tried all the tricks– heating the cup first, running it without a pod, but nothing works– all I get is a good flavored but lukewarm cup of coffee. And that's immediately after it's made and without putting anything in it! Add a drop of milk or let it sit for 1 minute and it's below room temperature. Very disappointing, as it means the coffee is practically undrinkable."
548,5.0,2020-03-14,기계 전용, 그레이,"I wanted to kick my Starbucks habit but still enjoy the same quality coffee/espresso. I have to say, this machine completely exceeded my expectations. The crema on top is to die for! I was also impressed with the sample box as there was a wide array of different brews. If you're on the fence because you're a coffee snob like me go for it! It does not disappoint."
549,1.0,2020-03-07,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I purchased this to replace my Keurig. Now let me just say that I am VERY tech savvy. I can literally take a computer apart and put it back together with no instructions and no problems. This machine does NOT give instructions on how to use. It literally only gives instructions on how to clean it upon arrival. My coffee is always too strong no matter what I do to it. I don’t like super sweet coffee but I don’t want bitter coffee either. A nice balance would be great. Also I was charged for a milk frother that I never received.
550,4.0,2020-05-10,기계 전용, 그레이,Easy to use
551,5.0,2021-03-31,기계 전용, 그레이,Works great but pods are a little pricey. But $1 a cup is way less than $5 a cup from you know who.
552,4.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I already own this appliance. Makes a GREAT cup of coffee or espresso, and is simple to use. The pods are a little expensive,but with frothy milk,its a treat!"
553,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,I was pleasantly surprised by how easy this coffee system was to use and how good the coffee actually is. I have been forever spoiled!
554,3.0,2021-01-12,기계 전용, 블랙,Bought in July and it has started leaking. Love the coffee but this machine is made very poorly. Looked on YouTube and past reviews and seems to be a common problem. I am going to try and get ahold of the manufacture because it should have a 2 year warranty. I will update this post after while.
555,5.0,2020-03-22,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,Love this machine. Great coffee. Ordering from Nespresso customer service is awesome...best customer service ever!
556,5.0,2020-06-13,기계 전용, 블랙,"When I first tried Nespresso coffee I was interested but hesitant because of the fact that coffee pods for competing brands are not recyclable. When I learned that I could, indeed, recycle the pods for this system, I felt like I could indulge in this wonderful coffee. I've not had the machine long so still have much to learn about which of the wide variety of coffees I like best. However, I'm enjoying it immensely so far. Just to emphasize, the recycling was the clincher for me."
557,2.0,2018-07-07,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This is actually a good news story. The VirtuoPlus was defective - brew button broke within 90 days on a morning when I needed coffee! Called Amazon - the transferred me to Nespresso and although it took some time, was able to shift to a regular Virtuo as a replacement and Nespresso had it on my doorstep the next day. Kudos to Nespresso and love the new machine - although its less fancy, it’s built to work and makes you feel more like a barista as it has the twist and lock mechanism! Much happier now as this was a success story in my book."
558,5.0,2021-08-17,기계 전용, 그레이,"Great tasting coffee if you can get beyond the amount of crema (foam) it generates. Some suggest the crema enhances the flavor, I don't. I have gotten around this excess crema by refilling the empty cartridges with my choice of ground coffee and reprogramming the brew process to a shorter cycle. Now it's excellent."
559,5.0,2020-12-16,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I love my Nespresso. It works like a charm & looks so cute sitting on my countertop. I love how smooth, creamy & delicious the coffee is. And I really love the fact that it brews the perfect cup every time by reading the barcodes - so cool! I would highly recommend this machine to anyone wanting a high quality machine!"
560,5.0,2022-04-16,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I literally cant stop using my nespresso machine. I use mine mainly for ice coffees and I'm obsessed!! MUST BUY!!!
561,1.0,2020-11-20,기계 전용, 그레이,I have had this machine for a little over a month and it has already quit working…after a month (go figure) so I can’t even return it. Literally nothing has worked. I wouldn’t even waist money on this one.
562,4.0,2020-02-11,기계 전용, 그레이,We bought this one to replace the same model where the filter was due for cleaning but the cleaning processes did not work. This one has been working well for the months since our purchase.
563,4.0,2018-07-01,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,The machine arrived as described. Only issue is the Nespresso box arrived without an outer box to conceal its content so the Nespresso box was damaged but not its content.
564,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,muy buedn articulo me acrado mucgho lo recomiendo
565,4.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,"Been using this machine for a couple of months now. Everything was as expected, really good machine, but the only problem I found is that the coffee does not come out very hot. I'm going to try using warm water in the water container and using a warm coffee mug and see if it makes any difference. This would be the perfect machine if the heating element made the coffee hotter."
566,5.0,2021-01-17,기계 + 캡슐 세트, 타이탄.,"I will never go back to a Keurig or traditional pot of coffee!!! It’s so easy to use and quick! I’m always running late and it doesn’t hold me up any longer. I normally drink my coffee with some cream & sugar, but it’s very pleasant “AS IS!”"
567,5.0,2021-05-03,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Nothing really to dislike about this machine. It works as promised. Get a good milk frothing machine and your ready for a delicious cappuccino.
568,5.0,2021-01-05,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,Perfect in every way! This is literally the best coffee I’ve ever had. I love that you don’t have to waste a whole pot of coffee; it just makes one perfect cup at a time! It brews quickly so I don’t have to be late to work. 11/10 would recommend
569,5.0,2022-05-28,기계 전용, 레드,Excelente
570,1.0,2020-07-25,기계 전용, 블랙,"Randomly turns on and begins brewing.
It also will not stay off. You must unplug it to be sure it will not misbehave. It makes me pine for the Verismo machine it replaced.
I recommend everyone avoid this glitchy, overpriced, disaster."
571,5.0,2020-01-24,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I originally got the Vertuo Evoluo because I was a recreational coffee/espresso drinker and didn't think I needed the Aeroccino bundle. Ended up returning it within a week because although the coffee was good, it just wasn't brewing hot enough. This machine is exactly what I was looking for - brews hot enough!!!, beautiful design, takes up less counter space, and comes with the milk frother. Worth the $$ in my opinion. Will update if I find that it leaks."
572,5.0,2021-07-06,기계 전용, 그레이,Love my nespresso. It's quick and quiet and makes delicious coffee/espresso
573,5.0,2021-07-11,기계 전용, 그레이,I upgraded from the original. Still getting used to the new coffee sizes and blends but the machine is very nice and works perfectly.
574,5.0,2019-04-20,기계 전용, 레드,"I used to have an original line Nespresso machine. They both doing very well, but the most attractive feature for VertuoPlus is that the capsule can make larger size coffee with the same quality."
575,5.0,2020-04-23,기계 전용, 블랙,Best purchase I’ve made in a while. It’s easy to use and the flavors are amazing!

578,5.0,2020-08-21,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I really love this machine. The lattes are so good. Easy on my stomach. I only use this now. Love all the flavors
579,2.0,2021-07-02,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Update 9 months later. Now the frother isn’t working properly. It won’t heat the milk any longer and sometimes is difficult to start. I’ll press the button and it will blink and never start. Seriously 9 months??? I am the only one that uses it once per day and I follow all instructions to a “t” for cleaning. I’ll reach out to see if I can get help with this but I really expect it to last longer than 9 months....

Wow, Starbucks coffee is a thing of the past now for me! As many have mentioned, the pods are the “worst” part of this system only because they are so expensive. But damn they are good. My drink at Starbucks was always soy latte. I have now perfected my homemade soy latte. I use the purple espresso pod and run it through 2 times. Then I use original Silk soy milk in the frother. Add the milk to the double espresso and voila! Best soy latte I’ve ever had for just over $1 per day. Not cheap but better than $4.50 at Starbucks. I’m happy!"
580,5.0,2021-05-26,기계 전용, 그레이,Amazing to enjoy
581,4.0,2020-12-15,기계 전용, 레드,The only criticism is that occasionally it won’t process a capsule and if you open the lid it dumps the capsule and they are pricey.
582,3.0,2020-05-20,기계 전용, 그레이,"I had this machine for 9 months and I loved it but it started leaking coffee while brewing few days ago, I cleaned it and tried again and still leaks while brewing.

585,3.0,2021-01-03,기계 전용, 레드,My bad review is strictly for the water tank . I just opened it and remove plastic and then decided to clean it with water and soap and when I realized the complete water tank was scratched. It didn’t warn that it was not supposed to be clean with sponge . So now it is completed scratched . I’m very disappointed.
586,5.0,2019-01-04,머신 + 에어로, 그레이, Best purchase i ever made ! I love my nespresso machine so much ! You will not be disappointed. Also the vertuo pods are not that expensive and you get an amazing experience every morning 😊
587,5.0,2020-03-07,기계 전용, 블랙,"wish I could also brew some plain water for hot tea, but the unit makes up for that in a quality cup of coffee. Froth on top, are you kidding? I still add a bit of vanilla coffee mate for a little added flavor. Well made and sturdy I'm sure it will last, been two months so far. Took me a while to figure out the brew cycle, even with instructions, could be me.."

590,2.0,2020-12-04,기계 전용, 그레이,Love the machine BUT from the packaging it appeared that it was returned and then sold to me. All of the sample coffee pods were in a plastic bag knotted shut and the box that the coffeemaker came in was pretty worn.
591,3.0,2021-06-01,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This is a very nice machine; the motorized compartment where the coffee pod goes is a fancy touch. The problem was the coffee. I did not like the coffee and my wife only liked two pods. Also, the temperature of the coffee was not very hot; it's ready to drink right out of the machine, but by the end of the cup, or if you wait a minute to drink it, the coffee is cold. The milk frother doesn't do well with soy milk, nor does it heat the milk enough either. I did not have problems with the water tank leaking as others have.
I would recommend going to a Nespresso store a few times and trying the coffee for free, prior to committing to buying the machine."
592,5.0,2020-05-20,기계 전용, 타이탄.,Couldn’t be happier with this machine! Love this smooth and coffee-shop like my coffee and espresso’s come out!
593,5.0,2021-02-05,기계 전용, 타이탄.,We have had one of these machines in the past and this one is even better with the larger water reserve. Makes a great cup of coffee.

600,3.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Bottom line:
1) Nespresso coffee is delicious. Lots of styles to suit lots of different tastes.
2) Coffee from this machine is ALWAYS too lukewarm. It always goes in the microwave after it is brewed.
3) The milk frother included in this is a joke. Get a different unit. Milk is as lukewarm as the coffee and the whol frother broke in 8 months after minimal use.
4) Nespresso customer service is also a joke- totally uninterested in helping resolve any problems. Just bought a different frother."

603,5.0,2022-02-27,기계 전용, 그레이,This is a GREAT machine. I am so satisfied. This one brews really quick and coffee is really hot. It takes up little space and allows to place anywhere since water tank can be moved.
604,3.0,2021-02-04,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I had to unfortunately return it for few reasons 1) aeroccino wasn’t working. 2) the serving programming wasn’t working well. 3) it takes more space on the counter compared to my previous machine. I am fan of Nespresso and would be looking for another model
605,5.0,2021-01-08,기계 전용, 블랙,I love the frothing and the taste and quality of the coffee! So happy with my purchase!
606,4.0,2018-05-17,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Makes much better coffee than the older Nespresso machines. If it wasn’t so expensive for the capsules I ‘d throw out my fully-automatic Gaggia but I drink a *lot* of coffee and need to trade off

The only thing I dislike is the cost of the coffee pods. Hopefully the price will decrease as length on market increases."

I love the one we use for clients at work, this is the best of both worlds if you want both coffee & expresso. The prior model will only make you a cappucino, americano, or expresso.

Get a milk frother with it for specialty drinks. The best

This honestly tastes better than most $2 or $3 dollar coffees or americanos that you would buy at any other store. The keurig should not be in the same conversation as this machine, there is a massive difference in taste, keurig tastes almost like instant coffee most of the time."

I read the manual which referred me to a specific # for solid red light. No go, called the club #, talked to a very nice agent who really tried to help it still did not work, so I was required to send it to them, because Amazon would put it back in inventory without fixing it. Company has quick turn around, so they fixed it, sent it back & it works. Unfortunately, I find the coffee very distasteful. So I will continue to use my Aeropress & battery frother. Their frother was excellent."

Quit working and Nespresso told me it would be up to 4 weeks for repair after they ship me a box to return in (that's a long time with out a coffee maker for 4 people in our house that drink coffee). Coffee and Espresso were good - nice and frothy, but the machine was confusing to use if you wanted to change the regular programming or clean it or reset it. Button seems like it started sticking after 1 month."

637,2.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,We are super disappointed in this machine. We have had other nespresso machines out last this one by far! Not worth the money
638,2.0,2018-11-27,기계 전용, 레드,"The product is nice, looks okay, great coffee and easy to use, but the capsules get sick in it all the time. They are supposed to slide out the back into a holder, but they get stuck when the holder gets full and when it's empty. When it does work right, you can't tell it's full, so they get stuck. You'll have to reach your hand into it to clear it, but then the thing that punctures the capsules press your and gets. I've stuck with it a long time, but I just name take it anymore. Looking for a replacement. But, besides what some other powwow said, it didn't break for me, just that design flaw."

Reading some reviews, I was afraid that it could be too loud. It 's not, and coffee is delicious.
Milk frother is great, I can finally have lattes at home.

I just wish that Nespresso pods are available in supermarkets."

The only bad thing is that capsules are expensive compared with the Nespresso Original line and K-cups. But if you are a person who enjoys the flavor, aroma and body of a good coffee then this worth the value."
657,1.0,2020-04-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Stopped working after a month, not sure why but i have called customer support and the only option is to pay repair cost that is nearly as much as machine or take a 35% discount on new model. We used this thing for a month but were unable to get a hold of support and eventually gave up. I got it for my wife's birthday gift last year. When I talked to them today they walked me through the reset options which I had already found online and then said I had a faulty button and need to order a new machine. Not impressed as i have 40 pods I can no longer use after using this only 20 times."

As are the pods... When I received it, not easy to use and after five days it stopped working and we had to return it.. pods are not interchangeable unlike keurig.. however it does make a good cup of joe... if ur like me and just need one cup a day of good coffee with ease, sorry but Nepresso is not it, try a keurig, I’ll get my replacement tmrw.. huge thanks to kohl’s and amazon for easy returns"

So that’s how I got the Nespresso. I love the wide variety of pods that came with it too. The only negative is that I can’t use the k-cups I had with the Keurig, and boy, do I have a lot of them."
661,1.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"Followed manual instructions, watched YouTube official videos, yet either way it doesn't work. They say to plug, press the button and a green light is supposed to show up. The only light I saw was a blinking orange one. No matter what you do, it keeps doing that."
662,3.0,2021-01-10,기계 전용, 그레이,I love this coffee machine but we had to send a request to replace ours within 2 weeks of owning it. The machine would make one or two cups of coffee and then get stuck in the “up” position. We have to unplug it for 30 minutes or more to get it to work again. I absolutely love the coffee it makes though!
663,5.0,2021-02-24,기계 전용, 그레이,I am a coffee freak and this machine is awesome! I’ve had Kreurig’s and recently bought this for expresso’s and it beats all around for an excellent cup of java. I can’t go back to my old Kreurig maker now. No comparison.

I think that even though it says you can move the water tank to be either in the back or at the side, that's not true. It seems that it may have started leaking after I moved my machine and moved the water tank to be more to one side."

I have it under the counter and usually it is not well lighted, and I have had a few half or quarter filled cups. It should flash or not let you make a cup!!"
671,4.0,2019-10-28,기계 전용, 블랙,Well made. First one purchased was defective. Thanks Amazon for easy return/replace. Watch out for air bubble when you first set up. Lot of info on web. Once it’s fired up it’s great. Great coffee. Paired with Citiz+Milk.

Looks very nice and is of high quality.
Made several cups of coffee and some shots of espresso with it soon as i got it opened and cleaned.
Well have used for over a week now and sadly the tank does leak a little if left on.
The coffee is so good that i'm not going to reduce my review because of it.
Is fine if you just pop tank off when done."

691,1.0,2021-05-05,기계 전용, 블랙,"Purchased the Nespresso Machine Only and was super excited to get this and start using. I opened the Amazon box it was in to discover the actual packaging looked like it had been man handled by a toddler with jelly covered hands. The box had a sticker that said it was new, but you could see it wasn't. The plastic handle that is on the top was missing, the cardboard tabs that are used to tuck in and close box were missing. It looked as if someone opened the box, used it, didn't like it, and threw it back in the box. So I figure let me see if the unit looks used. Some of the machine looked unused, but when I plugged it in and opened the top to see where the pod is kept there were coffee grains in the pod holder. My guess is someone bought and returned saying it was unopened. I'm pissed because now I need to go out of my way to get it to a UPS store, but I had to order a new one and have to wait longer to get it."
692,4.0,2021-06-30,기계 전용, 그레이,"The coffee is great - this is my third machine. I purchased this one for my office, but the pods don't eject like they're supposed to. So far I haven't been able to get much help in getting it resolved."

It has completely replaced my old drip coffee and Keurig machines for good! I always wanted an espresso maker, but didn't want the mess. Now I can have it without the mess. I love the pods! I don't like frothed milk so this is the version without the milk steamer/frother."

695,5.0,2019-06-28,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I have no other kitchen gadget that gives me this much joy. I’m not sold on the coffees but the espresso and milk frother thing are ridiculous. The purple pod espresso is my favorite and better than any espresso I’ve had at a coffee shop. I’ve told my friends that much like indoor plumbing and air conditioning became the threshold for habitability in the 20th century, the Nespresso is that for the 21st century."
696,1.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 레드,I ignored the bad reviews and bought it anyway. First machine broke after 3 uses dispensed way too much water coffee was more like tea. And the replacement they sent didn’t dispense any water at all. Waiting for the 3rd machine because I’ve already invested $50 on the pods. Save your money it’s garbage

701,1.0,2021-04-27,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This machine works perfectly for a few months or even longer, then all sort of problems start happening. This is not my first experience with nespresso machines, I have been a very loyal customer since 2015, with more than 200 sleeves per year! … I replaced over 5 machines since then! Yes 5 machines! This is not what to expect from a reputable company. Honestly, Their machines are not reliable at all, even if you do all their maintenance recommendations with descaling and clean cycles and everything… I love their coffee, it’s the best, but because of their crappy machines, I will stop buying their coffee. A lot of people on YouTube are complaining about their machines too, leakage, blockage, stopped working, you name it. Bottom line: unless they start doing factory recalls on their defective machines, or work on better machines, don’t buy their coffee/products."
702,5.0,2021-03-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"I purchased great ""used"" Nespresso, understanding no box coming with item. It was advertised as coming with sample capsules. It did not and Amazon generously credited me. However, once set up, we saw there was no click in cup holder. It was OK, after all. My point is, your warehouse does not cross check"
703,1.0,2020-06-29,기계 전용, 블랙,"I ordered one of these and it took so long to get here, that I thought it had been lost in transit. So I ordered another one. They both arrived within 3 days. The first one I ordered arrived 3 days after I HAD RECEIVED THE SECOND ONE AND WAS TRYING TO USE it. So, I sent it back without opening it. My husband continued to try to use the other one. It isn't working. Again and again, he tried to get it to work. Then he cursed and told me to send it back. So, here's the deal. I'm sending the second one back, today. So, I ordered two of these Nespressos and As of today, I am sending the other one back. That makes two ordered, and now, two sent back. I hope this makes sense to you."

Only con: Pods aren’t available in general stores (only manufacturers app, Amazon or speciality stores). Stopped my outside home coffee habit - prefer coffee from this machine instead. Great buy too. Saw same machine at speciality store for almost $200 more."
707,5.0,2019-12-13,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I was really looking forward to getting this. Heard makes excellent coffee. However, the tank leaks horrible. My counter was soaked. I should have taken those reviews about leaking tank more seriously.

I am revising my earlier review. The tank leak was my error for overfilling it to clean it. When making coffee with normal amount of water, no leaks. And it does make a wonderful cup of coffee."
708,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,Best purchase! The coffee is the greatest I've ever had and it is so easy to use and clean! I can no longer go to a drive through coffee shop or get coffee anywhere other than home because the quality is just subpar.

709,1.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"I've owned two of Nespresso's classic coffee machines. I like in particular the ability to use refillable coffee capsules, where I can use high quality expresso like Intelligensia's Black Cat beans. The Vertuo coffee system of Nespresso was supposed to be an improvement on the classic system. Our experience with this machine has been anything but positive. My guess is that Nespresso is trying to suppress the customization of capsules, and require that all capsules be purchased directly from Nespresso. So, the idea is that Nespresso uses centrifugal forces (high speed spinning) to extract coffee... brewing parameters are adjusted for each capsule, using the barcode data to regulate the flow and volume of water, as well as temperature, infusion time and capsule rotation speed, which is a process Nespresso says helps to produce a rich crema. In fact, this machine consistently produces bitter, foul coffee (but the crema looks good). Cleaning doesn't help, nor does any other adjustment documented in the manual. You can't buy refillable capsules that allow you to use your own coffee, either ... this is probably the main reason that Nespresso switched to the Vertuo system. The older classical system has become hard to find, which was a big reason for taking a gamble on their new Vertuo system."
710,2.0,2021-11-28,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I bought this Nespresso for my small office last year. We absolutely LOVE it! The coffee is wonderful. It started leaking/puddling and not working properly within a few months. We tried descaling a few times, to no avail. We ended up returning/replacing it (because we love it!). But within a few months again, we've had the same issues. And unfortunately we're outside our return window. So we have had to go back to our tried and true Keurig. Coffee isn't as good, and I loved the recyclable pods for the Nespresso, but I can't afford to buy a new machine every 4 months :( The Keurig lasts forever."

712,2.0,2021-01-23,기계 전용, 블랙,"It is an ok machine, convenient for an office. Unfortunately, Nespresso probably adds some foam agent to their coffees because the crema is simply excessive and it settles in a weired foamy residue after a a few minutes. Not very appetizing. Nespresso is not treating its customers seriously. I have addressed this issue with them and received a boiler response, lecturing me that I don't know what I am takling about and that the foam is great....maybe some people like it....I simply scoop the foam and throw it away. Always need another cup to store it....
Additonally, I ordered pods one week ago with ""second-day shipping."" One week later, still no coffee and a ""blame shipping company"" response.
I am waitng for another company to pick up the slack. Nespresso apears to be a ""caring company"" on the surface, but it is not really concered with its customers' feedback. I have to say I had issues with a previous machine and they have not addressed them either. It was leaking right after the warranty expired."

730,3.0,2021-06-20,기계 전용, 타이탄.,We have tried a few different flavors and they are all too bitter to enjoy. I had tried the original machine a few years ago and the coffee was amazing so I thought I would purchase this more affordable version. I wish we had just purchased a Kuerig.
731,3.0,2019-12-22,기계 전용, 그레이,I should have done more research before my purchase. This machine is quick and easy to make a good cup of coffee. I knew I would have to use only nespresso vertuoplus espresso pods and I was fine with that but I did not realize I can’t just pick them up at the grocery store or anything. They are hard to find and so you have to stay on top of pre-ordering them and there is not much of a selection.
732,3.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 블랙,"It started leaking coffee all over the countertop. We sent it back, and they fixed it. So far, it's working again for about 2 months. Makes a great cup of coffee, when it works."
733,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,By far the best coffee machine at this price. This is my second one. I bought this for friends who love it so much they are taking it on tour with their band. The flavor is like a $2000 coffee house cup but at just over a $100 dollar price. The best
734,5.0,2019-02-04,기계 전용, 그레이,Taste is great. There is so much flavor! It really makes thick crema. Finally went for it when I saw the price.
735,5.0,2022-05-02,기계 전용, 블랙,Really nice product. I recommend 100 percent.
736,2.0,2022-04-05,기계 전용, 그레이,"Picture on Amazon website shows coffee maker with name ""De'Longhi"" printed at top of coffee maker. In fact, the name is not printed on the coffee maker. The Nespresso Vertuoplus Coffee and Espresso Maker in Silver sells at retail stores for $199.99 and includes the Aeroccino3 Milk Frother (which sells on Amazon for $80.00). So on Amazon the equivalent pair would cost $124.99+80.00=$204.00, not a better deal than retail. But the biggest difference is the size of the water container: While the water containers from both units mentioned are equal in height, the diameter of the water container on the unit purchased on Amazon measures 3.5 inches whereas the retail store version measures 4 1/8 inches in diameter (the wall thickness of both being the same. Finally while the Grey color looks nice on a computer screen the actual plastic grey container clearly announces that it is plastic and the color is what you would find in a garage more than a kitchen or home bar."

742,5.0,2021-06-17,기계 전용, 레드,Bought for a deal on here for a Christmas present for my daughter. She was thrilled. I should have researched more. The pods for this machine are incredibly and stupidly expensive. She took it to work and only uses it as an Espresso machine; no coffee pods for her; and she loves coffee.

756,1.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I hesitated on buying this model because I kept reading reviews on lukewarm coffee, but then there were others who claimed their coffee came out hot. Well, I just made three cups, and every single cup came out what I would consider below lukewarm. I even microwaved my coffee mugs so they were piping hot, and frothed the creamer, and it did absolutely nothing. As for me and my household, we only do hot coffee, unless we are drinking iced. I will also note, that when I put the middle pod in, which is an Altissio, barely anything happened, a few drops of coffee came out, and that was it. I’m thinking I may have received a used, or broken machine as well. When I received my package, it looked like the box was worn, weathered, and previously opened. The frother also does not do a very good job of frothing. I have another frother from Espressotoria, and it’s amazing. So, there’s my eperience with Nespresso Vertuo Plus. I think I will be trying out the Ninja Coffee Bar."

758,1.0,2020-04-08,기계 전용, 그레이,"This is my second Nespresso VertuoPlus machine. The first machine (purchased November, 2019) began leaking coffee during brewing after 3 months use - Amazon promptly replaced the unit with a new device in January, 2020. The new machine began leaking coffee today, so I spent 62 minutes on the phone with a very patient and helpful Nestle associate, but after going through a significant number of repair steps, the machine continues to leak. So Nestle's solution is to send me an empty box to return the unit for repair, but they do not have any loaners to use in the meantime! So I have 3-4 weeks of time where I have to buy another coffee machine to use in the meantime!! Where is the sense in that. I like the coffee from the Vertuo, but the reliability is extremely poor. noting what I know now, I would not knowingly purchase a Nespresso machine, nor do I recommend it to anyone else."

762,1.0,2022-09-03,기계 전용, 그레이,"My husband bought the nespresso vertuo plus for me for my birthday in December 2019. By June 2020 it's leaking with every use. He saw that a few of the older models sold on Amazon had less than 4 star rating based on some durability issues, so he went with this version, which had a 4.5 star rating.
I used it a few times a week, mostly on the weekends, until I started working from home in March due to COVID-19. I loved the coffee and variety of pods available, but I am hugely disappointed in the quality of the machine. Given the volume of threads I found researching this issue - this is a systemic quality issue that has no ""home"" solution. After speaking with the customer service representative this morning, the only option is to send it in for repairs or replacement. It's fine for now, it's still under warranty, but I have no confidence that it will be usable long-term."

Only down side is that the pods for the machine are a bit more pricey than a Keurig but I knew this going in."
764,3.0,2021-01-15,기계 전용, 블랙,"It works as advertised, sort of.
The lukewarm espresso is a major downer. Recommendation from Support is to run hot water through the system by adding water to the ""Water Tank"" and pressing the brew button 3 times. This heats up the water and runs it through the system and out onto a large cup. At this point, the internals are supposed to be heated and therefore when you brew the espresso, it should be hotter. This was not the case. Espresso is still lukewam :("

770,1.0,2021-03-24,기계 전용, 블랙,Really like this coffee but the machine started leaking a little over two months of use. I had this problem on an older machine that I thought was just wear and tear over the years but now I am thinking it is a manufacturing issue.

Kidding aside, this produces flavors 300% better than the best keurig. Only draw backs are limited selection of pods, absolutely no tea, and you can't get just straight hot water from it. To tell the truth, I keep this machine and a keurig in my kitchen."

I call customer service and they say to reset machine. I have wasted so many coffee pods because it will go into cleaning mode instead of brew and literally brew the entire water container!!!! I’ve also had problems with the auto shutoff. I will get home in the afternoon and the coffee maker is still on and warm to the touch!!!! Maybe their newer machines have improved, but this Vertuo Plus by DeLonghi has been a headache! Let me add that the Nespresso Frother has been wonderful."

Exactly one month after the warranty expired, the machine started leaking copious amounts of brewed coffee from the bottom of the machine. I did a Google search that yielded hundreds of similar complaints. Taking the advice of one troubleshooter, I called the manufacturer. After being disconnected during the first call, I found an agent who tried to talk me through a fix over the phone, reading cheat notes from a company-issued binder, which meant that there was not much thinking outside-of-the-box going on. After 30 minutes of manipulating a toothpick, a toothbrush and warm sudsy water, we got nowhere. The final solution? Either send the $134.25 machine to get fixed for a fee of $125 or purchase a replacement machine at ""25% discount""--which, by the way, was the exact same price listed on Amazon. Neither were solutions that I found to be acceptable. I can only thank my stars that I have my old Keurig still in the garage."

Fortunately Amazon took the machine back, although I had to pay a 20% restocking fee.

Long story short, it leaked all over my counter. A couple of months later, started acting funny and found out it needed descaling. I bought descaling solution from Target, hoping this would resolve the issue, but it didn’t. After that, o decided it was taking up too much counter space, so I tossed in the garbage...yes the garbage.

Then it may or may not make coffee. After 2 days, it wouldn't turn on any more at all.
I did contact Nespresso direct to see if they had any ideas, and thank goodness it was still under warranty so they had me send to them ( free of charge) and they are repairing it at no cost. Should have it back in the next few days.

824,1.0,2021-01-06,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Well it made delicious coffee while it lasted!.

But now the Nespresso Vertuo Plus has died after just 2 months of normal personal use.

Completely unacceptable for a product that holds itself out as a luxury item.

Nestle is sending me a replacement but I honestly question how much I want to keep investing in their system and coffee when I feel I cannot trust it.

If you MUST buy a Nespresso, do your homework on the best models, because this is not one of em. Or better yet, just learn to make espresso the real way and buy a machine that will outlive us all. No expensive proprietary pod system to buy into either."
825,5.0,2021-03-01,기계 전용, 타이탄.,Very simple and straightforward device; it seems to taste much better than coffee from my Keurig prior to this. They also appear to run a recycling service via UPS for their pods so don't throw them out.
826,5.0,2020-01-04,기계 전용, 그레이,This was a gift for my hubby I could t wait to use myself so I didn’t wrap it I just put it right to work. Love it so much. I don’t go to Starbucks anymore coz I love my new machine! And way quieter than our old method.

Frankly I do not know where the machine was manufactured but Delonghi makes excellent coffee machines and so I am disappointed that the front of the machine isn't labeled ""DeLonghi""

2019/05/01 -- Today is my 2nd day using this machine.. seems to be okay for now."

835,1.0,2018-02-19,기계 전용, 그레이,I purchased this as a gift for my fiancé’s birthday. It worked great for the first 3 or 4 uses. Then....nothing. The whole machine just stopped working. We did figure out we can open it to put another coffee pod in by unplugging and plugging it back in but it still wouldn’t actually brew any coffee. And it will shut off and we have to unplug it again. We’ve reset it and looked up other possible fixes and nothing has worked. I’ve reached out to customer service and haven’t come to a resolution. Pretty bummed with this purchase as we bought additional coffee pods and storage for a nice little coffee station and we can’t actually make any coffee.

854,2.0,2020-06-23,기계 전용, 그레이,"When it works, it’s great. Three months of use and the water began leaking under the machine. The pdf file under the order’s customer support had me descale the machine. I used 1/3 white, distilled vinegar in the reservoir and let it cycle through wash and rinse. Green lights from there. I had been trying the MyCaps silicone top and filters. Don’t bother with them, as they are more trouble than they are worth, and may have contributed to the machine’s problem. We shall see.
After eleven months of wrestling coffee out of this machine, it gave up. All unused capsules will be gutted and transferred to my Keurig."
855,2.0,2021-04-16,기계 전용, 그레이,The coffee tastes good. It's very very loud. We think it must be defective.
856,5.0,2017-12-05,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Up until this point I was under the impression. I would need to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to get a solid espresso machine.

862,5.0,2020-04-14,기계 전용, 레드,One step use and automatic cleanup! All I have to do is load the pod and press a button. People who like bold coffee flavors (and not watered down coffee some places offer) this is for you
863,5.0,2017-07-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Love, love love my new Nespresso. The coffee taste better than the coffee I spend $5 a cup for at the finer coffee houses."

865,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,"This is an answer to ""I have no time for a coffee shop!"". When I need a mid-day pick-me-up, this makes a great cup of either coffee or espresso. Since narrowing down the varieties I enjoy, the experience has become a highlight of a busy day.
Nothing bad to say, as of yet. Love the coffee it makes."
866,5.0,2021-04-10,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I read a review before I bought one and someone said, ""throw out your Keurig"". They weren't kidding. Love the flavor."
867,2.0,2021-11-17,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I am giving this product only 2 stars cause I am not in position to use it straight away as I received since there was no complimentary pack of 12 capsules in package, although it is mentioned in product description. Also the package content on the box is saying that with machine you are to receive complimentary gift of 12 different coffee flavors capsules. If I knew that, would order coffee separately in order to receive together with machine."
868,2.0,2021-05-18,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"The coffee is OK but those cords!!! They don't show you those in the pictures but they are huge, long industrial sized cords that you can't hide or wrap around something. That plus the too expensive pods are why I am giving it three stars. The cord I have pictured is from the frother, the coffee machine has basically the same cord so you get to deal with both cords.
Edit
I bought this in 2017 and just broke it out after a couple of years of not using it. Now I remember why I quit using it, the coffee is barely hot, I drink it black and even at that it needs to go in the microwave for 30 seconds. I am lowering review to 2 stars."
869,1.0,2020-05-27,기계 전용, 그레이,Machine broke after having it one month. To get it repaired will take a minimum of 2 weeks. Unfortunately return window closed

872,4.0,2021-02-19,기계 전용, 그레이,Thankfully we had tried this out in a store first. If you have guests maybe include some directions on there. But makes delicious coffee.

875,5.0,2020-11-16,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"This is the best espresso system yet. Better than earlier Nespressos because it provides different pods for different serving sizes. Makes great espresso.

My only complaint is that there are not any real strong coffee blend pods available in decaf"
876,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, LE 블랙 매트,Only had it for a few weeks but I like it so far. It’s plastic but I knew what I was getting beforehand. Best part is the great tasting coffee. My hubby doesn’t like coffee but he is now craving an espresso everyday.
877,4.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,I loved my machine but it broke after only 5 months of light usage. Nespresso is a nightmare to contact so we now have a broken machine.

After only four months of not daily use started leaking, search online and it seems to be a regular issue.

By the way the machine was shipped in its original packaging and was open for the first time in our home since I used a door to door service. I understand that fees to get it to the US and back should be covered by me but don't bother, warranty is void. I'm still looking the warranty specification since is the first time I hear something like this. Thanks Nespresso, a very fast way to lose my money."

I sent a request for to contact me online but after a week I have gotten no response. I again went online to see if I could try again for assistance. The USA website has NO WAY to contact them except by phone or snail-mail. What the heck is that all about??? Now, I will say the coffee is pretty good, but the extra cost for a useless plastic cylinder, when I wanted to be able to add warmed, frothed milk to the coffee really has me steamed. If you simply want the coffee, save the money and buy a unit without the frother."

896,2.0,2021-04-22,기계 전용, 그레이,I had a Nespresso machine for 18 years. It finally guit. We didn’t need a fancy one so we chose this one. It is so cheaply made! I can see why my original one lasted so long. The water container is really cheap plastic bi don’t expect this machine to last 3 years let alone 18 years. It’s easy to use I like the new way of expelling the capsules. I am afraid that if I dropped any part it would break. I don’t care if I can get replacements. I saw this model when I was in Germany. It was not so cheaply made. Not satisfied

The Nespresso web site people just tell you to follow the instructions in the manual that didn’t work before I contacted them. I have never been more disappointed in a purchase in my life... Be warned this thing is a expensive chunk of junk.

2days later.... I finally got on to a different customer service rep who actually knew how to get my coffee pot out of the descale mode took about 1 1/2 hours and one hell of a long phone call but it's back up and running. Will sell it soon and get something that's not so complex all I want is good coffee"

The “start” button is mushy, you can’t always tell you pushed it correctly. The owner’s manual isn’t real helpful - very general instructions and didn’t address our problem at all. We looked for videos on our machine to see if we could find something. The one video we found was a man experiencing the same problem, long story short, he didn’t resolve it either.

We are having to buy another machine and it WAS NOT this brand!"

931,5.0,2019-07-30,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Not much about this product we dislike, the only exception is the availability of the pods. They are not anywhere in stores to purchase you have to order off the Nespresso website or Amazon."
932,5.0,2021-09-23,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Seriously this has ruined me. I had a Kuerig before and that was fine, but the quality of coffee shooting out of this thing is far superior than anything I tasted on the Kuerig. The coffee is more expensive than I am used to but it's well worth it."
933,5.0,2020-04-03,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,I bought this nespresso machine for my 5th wheel camper. I have a more expensive model at home and this one does just as good as the more expensive model for a better value.

935,5.0,2022-07-23,기계 전용, 그레이,".....just for when I want ONE really good quality cup of coffee! I find it’s so rich & the frothiness replaces the need for 1/2 & 1/2 , which has been great for my diet!"
936,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Love the ease at which you get a great cup of espresso or cappuccino, it’s easy to clean as well"
937,2.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"I didn’t realize that I have to flush a tank full of water every week to keep the coffee tasting decent. I’ve only had it six weeks and about every three weeks, the coffee starts to taste sour. I called the Nespresso club number and she had me factory reset the machine and told me that they recommend the weekly flushes because these machines are “sensitive”. I don’t know...it was cool in the beginning but I’m now regretting this purchase. My friend has the same machine, but she didn’t even have to flush it once (she’s had it for 3-4 months)."
938,5.0,2019-01-09,기계 전용, 그레이,Still using it and its a great product!
939,2.0,2020-06-17,기계 전용, 블랙,"This machine did make great tasting coffee. But, after only one month it started to leak somewhere inside and came through the bottom with water and mold. I was worried about purchasing this machine in the beginning because of the mixed reviews both here and YouTube reviews. Back to a Keurig."
940,5.0,2020-01-02,기계 전용, 레드,"The machine is easy and fun to use, and the coffee is divine. The pods can be purchased directly from Nespresso if you are looking for better deals and diversity. I'm hooked."

948,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,The coffee this makes is amazing. Only complaint is that I wish it had a cup setting so I didnt have to brew the same pod three times to fill my cup
949,5.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Got this as a gift for my sister and she loves it. She says the coffee is the best she has had but the kids are expensive and hard to find
950,5.0,2020-06-21,기계 전용, 그레이,I had the Nespresso Espresso Maker and I felt like it was too small a cup of coffee to start the day. This Coffee maker makes the perfect size cup for my morning coffee. Love it.
951,5.0,2021-01-02,기계 전용, 그레이,I wanted a Nespresso machine and this came up for a lightening deal. I was not disappointed. It is a slim design so it doesn't take up too much room on your countertop.
952,2.0,2020-08-20,기계 전용, 블랙,"I bought this to replace a Breville Nespresso Machine which took up more counter space, so I had the opportunity to compare them directly. The Breville Nespresso machine produced a much thicker crema and a better tasting coffee than this DeLonghi machine did. With the green-colored coffee pods the crema on the Breville was nearly two inches thick, while the DeLonghi produced barely half that. I suspect that the Breville spins the pods faster and with more force, or at least it sounds that way. The Breville coffee had more body while the DeLonghi coffee was noticeably flatter."
953,1.0,2021-01-01,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"The machine came with fails and not working. The press botton on the top did not not work and the coffee did not flow. That is the reason I had to return the product to seller SHIBO on Jan/14th.
Up to now (Jan/20th) I have no answer about the return . Please give me some position about it"
954,5.0,2021-04-01,기계 전용, 그레이,Tried this unit at a friend's house. I've been using it for over 6 weeks now and still love it. The foam on top of every cup is a treasure.

962,4.0,2017-11-29,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Having a little trouble sometimes it stops and I have to re starded a few times to complete a full cup
963,5.0,2020-01-19,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,Easy to use and to clean. I love that it is cheaper than buying coffee out everyday. The coffee quality tastes 10 times better too! A great investment for sure!

967,5.0,2020-07-09,기계 전용, 그레이,Decided to try the used version. To my surprise it was in pristine condition with a little dent on the box! Super easy and perfect for the value. So excited to try the different capsules.
968,3.0,2021-03-21,기계 전용, 그레이,"I'm, not interested, ""in the morning"", standing in front of the coffee machine, holding the brew button while the machine does it's thing. It should make a decent cup of coffee at a single press of a button."
969,5.0,2019-12-23,기계 전용, 그레이,I prefer my Nespresso coffee rather than Starbucks. The coffee is so smooth and favorable.
970,1.0,2020-10-19,기계 전용, 레드,"Un understand to use it or change the coffee size, it was missing the milk steamer item"

I can froth milk, but the other whisk was supposed to be a light froth or for heating the milk only. Quess I'll have to buy an extra whisk since I can't find out how to contact the seller."
985,5.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,Love it! Everything about it. Easy to use and clean. Bulkier than the regular Nespresso line but so worth it. There’s something for everyone.

990,5.0,2021-06-30,기계 전용, 블랙,"Wow, this machine makes some seriously good coffee. I love how the water chamber holds so much water and I don’t have to refill it very often. No problems with this machine. It is very easy to use."
991,5.0,2019-07-31,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,I recommend this if you want the best tasting coffee. The pods cost more than Keurig pods but taste way better.
992,5.0,2018-12-13,기계 전용, 그레이,What an awesome coffee and espresso machine. Nespresso is a coffee game changer. The machine arrived in perfect condition and was easy to assemble. One of my best purchases.

995,1.0,2020-12-01,기계 전용, 그레이,"The unit was less than 6 months old when it started developing a leak. I have Emailed their customer service twice and received no response so I had to get Amazon rep involved to get a Nespresso rep on the phone. After spending an hour on phone, the rep was finally convinced that the unit was defective and told me that the unit would have to be shipped for a repair. She said the repair would take two weeks, not including the time in transit. No loaner unit, or replacement and she insisted that the unit be repaired. Now I need to spend next two + weeks with no coffee maker, and Nespresso has absolutely nothing to offer."
996,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,Great machine. Works well
997,1.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 레드,My Nespresso VertuoPlus machine quit working after 45 days of using it only once a day. Now it doesn't brew using the proper amount of water resulting in quite a mess on my counter top I contacted customer service through Amazon and because it was outside the 30 day return window they could only refer me to the Delongi website to be told i could not get a replacement for 3 months due to a computer chip shortage. My coffee pods will be old by then! Very frustrated and disappointed.
998,1.0,2020-12-21,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"I have an original Nesspresso Citzi and Milk machine that I have for over 10 years. It has been great. No problems at all. It was time to buy a new machine. I was really hoping the Vertoline would be just as dependable. However, the seller sent me a used machine. The packaging wasn't even sealed. I didn't take it out of the box. You could tell just by looking at it that it was either a return or display model but not factory new. I wasn't going to waste my time to see if it would work. I love the Nesspresso machines and unfortunately this seller this not doing Nesspresso any favors."

It will not recognize any programming size for coffee capsules, it will brew a capsule until until you hit stop.. It fills 2 and a half cups sometimes and sometimes it brews normal. Very disappointed with how fast this machine got faulty. I want a replacement because I love the Nespresso coffee."

Then the one and only button wouldn’t respond at all. So I exchanged the machine for this one, same exact machine, and this one didn’t even work out of the box. It would power up but again the one and only button did not work. After a call with Nespresso they said it sounds like defective wiring. Having had two bad experiences in a row I returned this for a refund. Perhaps try another brand like Breville."

This is the second Nespresso machine that I have purchased for our office and yet it is stopped working again. I added a warranty and yet I can get no assistance with a replacement.

1029,1.0,2022-05-11,머신 + 에어로, LE 블랙 매트,I am highly disappointed in my product. If there is something out of stock the pull the item from the list so guy don’t disappoint anyone else. I did lot of research and Chose this model AND the frother was a bonus... yet it didn’t come with a frother and I was offered 20 dollars off. First it was “our packers double check to make sure everything is there and maybe it was lost” THEN it was “sorry it’s out of stock” Uhm no.... I want what I paid for now I’m left no choice but to return it. Thanks for the inconvenience!

1032,4.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,"In normal operation this makes great coffee. After a time, by design, you will get an error indication that it's time to descale and shortly your machine will stop making coffee until you do. Chuck the Nespresso instructions and find a youtube video for your machine and follow along. There are only two controls, the cup button at the top and lever at the front. Sometimes you need to press them at the same time but other times separately. Sometimes you need to press the for a long (3s) time but other times just a tap. The machine state needs to be decoded from a multi-colored ring that blinks with different colors and different rates. If you are color-blind you may have a problem. My machine had been back to the company three times to be fixed before they gave me a new one with a shortened warranty. This required 4 or 5 phone calls of at least 30 minutes each. I've been using this machine for 18 months and still need to go to youtube to make it work sometimes. Also, don't stockpile a large number of pods because if you get frustrated and decide to trash the machine you could be stuck with hundreds of dollars of coffee pods you can't use."

1039,1.0,2017-07-11,기계 전용, 레드,I have had nothing but problems with this machine ever since I bought it. It worked fine for a few weeks but after that the lid won't open sometimes for 10 minutes at a time. It at least once a week will just endlessly pour water into a cup when I am trying to make coffee and the only way to stop it is to unplug it.

1056,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,Absolutely the best coffee machine. Makes the freshest coffee and espresso I’ve ever had in the comfort of your own home. Definitely worth the money and would recommend to others.
1057,2.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,This is how my box arrived. Just like this! I’m hoping the machine isn’t damaged when I open it. And I was quite disappointed that it wasn’t in a plain box because now my husband knows what he’s getting. Literally open.

1059,1.0,2020-08-31,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I purchased this unit through a reseller, not from Amazon. After going through the recommended set-up procedure the unit displayed the solid red error light. I contacted Nespresso directly who walked me through the troubleshooting procedures; unplug and retry after 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and overnight. Each try failed and Nespresso recommended the unit be returned. After returning the seller claimed the unit worked fine and charged us a $77 return/restock fee. I will no longer be purchasing higher priced appliances or other equipment from resellers as they can't be trusted."

1064,3.0,2019-03-28,기계 전용, 그레이,The machine works great but the cup platform is too small for the cups most people use today. We use the larger cups that fit fine under our Keurig machine but hang a tiny bit over the edge on this one. Coffee is great though!

1069,1.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"This machine worked wonderfully for about 3 months... it developed a leak during brewing, leaving half the coffee in the cup, the other half on the counter. A Google search revealed this problem is very common with the model. Sent into Nespresso support; they returned it 5 days later with a part replaced. The ""fixed"" machine sounded like a lawnmower, with loud rattling and vibrating. On the first cup brewed, the machine still leaked - coffee made it to the cup, but now water spilled everywhere. So frustrating... had to buy a new model (Evoluo). To Nespresso's credit, they credited me the cost of the new machine and sent some coffee pods, too."

After spending an hour on the phone with Nespresso service who had me running through the cleaning cycle, factory resetting, and descaling, it still didn't work. They said I could have it repaired for $125 or buy a new one for 35% off. Not very helpful."

1095,5.0,2020-01-02,기계 전용, 그레이,Best coffee machine I have ever had. The best coffee I have ever drank from a home machine.
1096,1.0,2022-04-01,기계 전용, 블랙,The box came open and machine had previously been used. Looks like the person who bought it before me realized the machine was broken and returned it. Has a leak and coffee gets spilled all over while preparing. Amazon didn’t verify the product was damaged before shipping it out again even though they sold it as a new item.
1097,1.0,2020-10-27,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Recommend you purchase directly from nespresso. I received the wrong item and was directed to several agents to process the claim before eventually getting in touch with amazon for a refund once I returned item. Was not offered option to have replacement sent. Very frustrating and can be avoided by purchasing directly though nespresso.

For me a few problems (although one woman in our office loves hers). Like I never could find a flavor I liked; two, the refills are awfully expensive ; and well, I guess there isn’t a third! I would just add , not a good product for “regular coffee drinkers"
1102,1.0,2019-01-14,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"Always lots of coffee in the capsule reservoir & never the proper volume in the cup. They said it would update with the app & fix that. Never happened. Then, 2 months after purchase, it started leaking all over the counter. Too late to return, it’s trash now."

I have gone through the manual and descaled the machine, I have spent the money on the descaling chemical and still the machine won't work! The Nespresso website is no help and now I no longer have my favorite thing about the morning!! I have spent hundreds of dollars on capsules so for this to happen after 10 months of use I am furious! Terrible issue to have especially since it was working fine! But some sensor shuts it down!!"
1104,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Love it. Very easy to use.

Why is this junk so expensive when it can't even last 1 year? I only make 1 or 2 portions of coffee daily. It's not like its running constantly. Angry and disappointed."

It’s a second time that I bought this machine. First time I had to put on the trash because the machine has been worked for a just 3 months and stopped to work. By right now I did the return because I bought it like 30 days ago and the machine stopped to work again. I’II not to buy this machine anymore on my whole life.

I contacted Nespresso's customer service and was advised to send it back to Amazon as it was a ""defective machine."" I have no confidence in this brand of coffee maker...you would think that for over a hundred and fifty dollars for a coffee maker, it would make coffee. Not in this case.

1178,1.0,2020-05-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"The first month with the Nespresso Vertuo Plus was flawless, but now that it's been two months, I can only use the coffee maker about 50% of the time.

I keep it plugged in all day, and some days when I try to use it, the device has a solid green light but when I push the brew button; nothing happens, and I'll wait three minutes.

I need to return this device, it's super disappointing for such a ""premium"" promise"

1185,1.0,2019-09-23,기계 전용, 레드,Terrible ease of use from the beginning. I thought maybe it was because I never had an espresso maker but after a few weeks I realized it must have been either broken during delivery or just broken before I received it never really worked it took several times to get the coffee to come out even warm if it came out at all. Extremely disappointed I saved up to get me this machine and I never got it to work but a handful of times.

The water flow mechanism is broken, so the water never leaves the tank. I spent about an hour on the phone with nespresso.com, going through the same troubleshooting steps I did on my own, and it still wouldn't work. I thought, really?? It's not like I'm designing a nuclear warhead. All this trouble for an overpriced cup of coffee. Amazon was generous. They offered to send me a third one, but I gave up and asked for my money back."

1211,1.0,2019-10-19,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,The packaging was ripped and it was taped up. The water container had water spots on it already! The machine makes inconsistent amounts of coffee that doesn’t align with the amount in ounces that the pod lists. Be careful with this provider.
1212,2.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,I really wanted to love this but the coffee just dispenses to cold. the company needs to install some sort of temperature adjustment within the unit. Its such a shame because the quality of coffee is great but the coffee never comes out hotter than lukewarm.

And when it was working, I was not impressed with the quality of the coffee it was making: too much foam and not a lot of flavor.

1232,1.0,2017-11-12,기계 전용, 그레이,"After less than a year, my VertuoPlus began leaking coffee from the bottom of the appliance. This has been regularly maintained by cleaning and descaling. I called Nespresso Club and after learning about the problem, they offered a replacement...of a cheaper version because they said mine was out of stock. I declined and told them I’m going through the Asurion plan I purchased, and so far I’m glad I did. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy this, or if you do, make sure you purchase the Asurion plan because Nespresso Club were useless with their assistance and I wouldn’t be getting another if it weren’t for the plan."

1248,1.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,Came brand new but when I tried to use it the very first time it had a solid red light. I looked in the manual what this means and it means the machine is not running. So I went to Nespresso website and diagnosed the problem and followed their instructions on how to fix it. It let me make coffee the one time after that. But every morning I had that issue. I returned it after that. It’s been 2 weeks since Amazon has received my defective item. Yet still have not received my refund.....
1249,1.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,The first one I received wouldn't shut off and would spill all over the counter. I returned it and requested a replacement. The replacement wouldn't even run water so I returned it as well. It was supposed to be a birthday gift for my girlfriend so I bought one locally that worked but was more expensive. Now Amazon is shorting my refund by 40 dollars.

The box was torn and taped up and there were multiple return labels on it which made me question whether the Nespresso machine was used or not working right and returned. I’m very disappointed and wanted to return it for a new one. I tried contacting the seller thru Amazon but I never heard back from them.

1320,1.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This product makes a fine cup of coffee/espresso. Grand, even. Unfortunately for me the needle broke just outside of the 1 year warranty. $125 to whisk away the machine for repair or a 35% discount on a replacement machine (mind you, this discount isn't applicable to the latest machine) for about the same amount. Already an indulgent approach to morning coffee, this is an untenable luxury in the post COVID-19 hellscape we find ourselves. Don't add more uncertainty to your life. It's on to chicory for me. Lukewarm regards, Nespresso."

The milk frother is fine, but the coffee machine has never worked- it won’t pull water from the tank.

First time plugging it in, I was impressed by being able to brew a full cup of coffee and I also have a (pixie). My excitement washed away quickly because the machine started leaking everywhere. I thought that was odd. I cleaned up the mess but the machine continues to leak every time I use it. I will be calling amazon and Nespresso today. This review will be updated after I find out if my machine will be replaced or fixed."

1333,1.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 레드,"Just a big no on this thing. A Keurig just makes coffee, just works. A Keurig doesn't lock you into a single source for coffee. A Keurig won't lock up in an attempt to sell ""descaling"" packets. A Keurig doesn't cost as much as airfare home for the holidays

To be fair, this thing continues to work. It's not ""broken"" per se. But the next time it locks up _forcing_ me to descale it I'm likely to beat it to death with a baseball bat. Never again Nespresso. You lost a lifetime customer over a five dollar descaling packet. Congrats"

It goes through a cleaning system at set up and was not working correctly. When finally getting it all set up, it also brewed differently than the Breville. The pump doesn’t seem to be powerful enough for the machine . We are returning it."

I originally bought the Cube when Nespresso first came on the scene and later a pixie for my office. I bought this machine hoping for a quality coffee product like the original line. This coffee is a Cadillac Keurig and the coffee does not taste good. I would return but have missed my window to return. Too bad. If you love Nespresso original line and love the quality, rich coffee, stick with it."
1345,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,Yes to all uses!!!

1347,1.0,2018-10-21,기계 전용, 블랙,"Do not buy. Get the Evoluo model. After two and a half months this machine started pouring coffee out the back of the machine during brewing. It got all into the used capsule storage area and all over my counter with each brew. After two phone calls to the Nespresso club, and three hours of my time, they sent a replacement Evoluo machine. Apparantely they do not fix this model....probably because there are so many leaky models that its an inherent design flaw. Google it....you will see the number of complaints."
1348,2.0,2022-08-18,기계 전용, 그레이,Had to have it replaced due to stopped working in less then a week.

1354,1.0,2019-07-27,기계 전용, 그레이,Read the one star reviews. Same exact thing happened to us. Stopped working after a year. Very disappointed
1355,2.0,2021-05-16,기계 전용, 블랙,worked fine for 2 months but now unusable as it leaks 1/4 cup of coffee water from the head of the machine where the capsule goes
1356,3.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,The cleaning cycle doesn’t work
1357,1.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"Returned two of these VertuoPlus models: first one, the motor broke on the lid lifter, and the second one, the water carafe leaked. Nespresso is good about customer service to exchange for a new one, but after two problems with this newest model, I asked them to send me last years model, the Evoluo. In retrospect, I should have assumed a motorized lid was unnecessary and with more moving parts would be prone to failure over time (but not two weeks, for Pete's sake), and the very slim water-feed mechanism, which the Nespresso agent acknowledged was giving them fits, was too pretty/cool, yet problematic."
1358,1.0,2019-09-19,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,The coffee was great but broke after a few months of use. Nespresso wants me to send it out to them to get it fixed leaving me without a machine for likely a month. Just going to buy a new machine of a different brand most likely.

1364,2.0,2018-12-13,기계 전용, 블랙,"I already have 1 and the machine itself is great. However, this was a gift and the packaging was broken, falling apart and completely unacceptable. Not sure I will be ordering again from here in the future."
1365,1.0,2018-01-03,기계 전용, 그레이,"This product does not use classic Nespresso pods, only Vertuo. There were no Vertuo pods at 2 Kroger locations and one pack available at 2 Safeway locations. Have to buy them online."

1372,2.0,2018-12-27,기계 전용, 레드,"The product produces coffee, but you continue to pay for specially packaged coffee.
The eventual total cost of ownership will be very high. The product is very over-engineered.
I prefer the ability to buy my own espresso coffee any time and using an inexpensive machine to produce drinkable coffee."
1373,5.0,2021-12-10,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,That it's not compatible with small capsules.
1374,2.0,2021-02-02,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,I purchased this at Christmas and it’s already breaking down. It freezes up constantly so I have to reset it. It now also will only males shots and not full size cups like it did before. Unhappy I spent nearly $200 on a machine that didn’t last but a few months.
1375,5.0,2018-08-27,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Dangerously addicting. In a good way!!

1378,2.0,2020-01-03,기계 전용, 그레이,The machine started to leak coffee within a month of my purchase. I sent it to repair.how can I machine that has been only used for a month can break down? It’s ridiculous.
1379,1.0,2018-09-24,기계 전용, 그레이,This machine makes wonderful coffee...at least it did before it started leaking all over my counter. It has been descaled with no effect. I bought it in April of this year and it started leaking a month ago. That is only 6 months of use for a very expensive coffee maker. I went back and read reviews about this model on the Nespresso website. Everyone complains of it leaking. As much money as the coffee is you would think they could make a quality product.
1380,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,Great product the coffee maker is excellent
1381,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,I like it

1383,1.0,2021-04-06,기계 전용, 그레이,I bought it a year and a half ago. It now only makes clear water when the pod is inserted. Have followed all descaling protocols. Manual and online show no info on how to fix the situation. Not sure the money and expensive pods are worth it for a coffee pot that only lasts a year and a half. Don’t recommend.
1384,1.0,2020-10-29,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"When it makes the correct cup, it is great coffee. When...the 7.77 oz cups always deliver over 15 oz of watered-down coffee and over half the 2.4 oz pods/double espresso pods deliver over 6 oz of watered-down 'espresso.' Wouldn't recommend at any price. You have to order pods and well over half don't work. Avoid!!"

1386,1.0,2019-02-08,기계 전용, 그레이,Love the coffee but the machine doesn't last... one lbroke after just a few pods...three orders... they replaced....then the second one lasted just long enough to be out of warranty...2 pods a day is not stressing the machine...my question to nespresso after three machines and hundreds of pods...why cannot they back the machine up just fix the machines.....I HAVE TWO SITTING HERE DOING THE SAME LEAKING EACH TIME I DO A POD...WORTHLESS ...AND BOTH PURCHASED IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS...

The Amazon replaced it with a new one, after I used the second one for 3 1/2 months, It started leaking again. I tried to call the support line, it transferred me to Nespresso, then let me wait for over 20 minutes, nobody picked up my call. Unfortunately, I purchased hundreds of its coffee capsules. Hopefully, Nespresso can replace it with a different model without this leaking problem."
1391,5.0,2019-06-07,기계 전용, 그레이,Great product .
1392,1.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 블랙,Broke in less than 60 days. Took immaculate care of it; cleaned it on a weekly basis. Warranty process is a pain in the assets; attempted to have us repair it ourselves (I definitely do not fall into the “handy man” cohort) then tried to replace it w/ a cheaper model until I finally said I was putting all this on amazon and magically my model was available for replacement. Absolutely ridiculous. Is it really that hard to do the right thing?

1407,1.0,2018-10-24,머신 + 에어로, LE 블랙 매트,The product I received is dirty and smells like coffee. There are specks of coffee grounds where the pod goes and the pods are literally open. Really disappointed.

I have purchased three Vertuo Plus machines, one for the office, and two for home. The red Vertuo Plus is an awesome color and meets every expectation I have. The Keurig coffee machines cannot stand up to a hard comparison...boils down to Keurig's plastic tasting K-cup coffee vs the Nespresso aluminum capsules top coffee quality and incredible taste.

1529,4.0,2019-11-29,기계 전용, 그레이,"First off, and most important, this makes amazingly good coffee. I am not an fancy coffee person, I don't do Starbucks or similar shops, I just like a good cup of coffee. And this definitely nails that.
The pods are pretty expensive, so this is not my everyday coffee but for a treat on weekends or special occasions only. If the pods were more readily available, and definitely if they were cheaper, I'd probably end up drinking it more often, but I've only been able to find them online so far, and there aren't any off brands yet.
My biggest issue with this machine is the lack of a low water light or something similar. When it runs out of water, it doesn't tell you. It will start making coffee and make only half of a pod because it ran out of the water. A few times this has happened I thought I put in an espresso pod which makes a much smaller cup. And of course once I opened up the machine and realized I put in a bigger pod, I can't use it again because it's poked so many holes in and the pod is pretty much wasted. Obviously I am working on remembering to check that every time before I turn it on, but that does not help my guests very much when they go to use it.
I also wish that the water reservoir was more firmly attached to the machine. It's great that you can position it to the back or the side, but it feels like if I am not super careful when I refill it, I could break it off from the actual machine. And, of course I want a bigger reservoir.
Overall, I love the coffee that this machine makes enough that I will continue using it, but I hope by the time I'm ready for a new one they have considered the design a bit more."
1530,2.0,2021-10-08,기계 전용, 그레이,I like the coffeemaker but am very unhappy with the fact that it needs to be descaled (cleaned) very often. I am very dissatisfied with this and want to return it since it doesn't work properly.

1579,1.0,2019-07-01,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,This product leaked after 14 months of use. Nespresso Customer Service was terrible. I was promised a callback from a Customer Service Manager and that never happened. Many phone calls to them with no help.

Was so excited about the product at first, but lifespan is very limited. Unsure why the recommended procedure did not work, but have gone back to pour over for time being.
May try the new version with the euro proportions - enjoyed one in the hotel while traveling. Maybe this one has less issues... For the price of these machines, I would expect them to last more than a year. Unfortunately we had not purchase a protection plan in advance, so ours may become garbage, unless there is a way to recycle?"

1632,1.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,"The machine was great at first. However, It started leak coffee(I wish it was water) after 6 months of use. Customer service was useless."
1633,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,"I love coffee and have been drinking it daily for over 60 years. But I am the only coffee drinker in my house, and the hassle of making a decent single cup of coffee was always a problem until Keurig came out with its single brew coffee maker in 2006. The coffee was never great, but it was decent, and the coffee came out hot, which I liked.

Recently I acquired the Nespresso Veturo Plus ,and now I’ve finally found my ideal coffee maker. It is more convenient to use than the Keurig, and the coffee is produced is much better. It appears that this coffee maker is also sold with Breville and De’Longhi labels, but I suspect all three are identical.

This coffee maker is very easy to use. Unlike the Keurig, it doesn’t have a setting that keeps the water always hot, but it only takes a minute or so to heat up. The water reservoir in the Nespresso is larger, meaning you don’t have to refill it as often, and it is much easier to remove, refill and replace than the Keurig. Cleaning is easier, and the Veturo takes up less room on my kitchen counter.

While the Nespresso Veturo line of coffees aren’t as extensive as what is available for Keurig, I found the Nespresso coffees offered to be excellent, with a range of strengths that exceeds that available from my Keurig. In addition, I sometimes enjoy a double espresso, which the Nespresso makes pretty well.

I have read complaints that the coffee doesn’t come out hot enough in the Nespresso machine. But it does. What’s needed is a good, heated insulated cup to keep the coffee hot. I have found the BTaT- Insulated Coffee Mugs, Glass Tea Mugs, Set of 4 (12 oz, 350 ml), Double Wall Glass Coffee Cups, available from Amazon to be the ideal cup. To make a cup of coffee in the morning I first turn the coffee make on by pressing the button on the top. I then fill a coffee mug with water and heat it for two minutes in the microwave, meanwhile making my breakfast. When breakfast is almost ready, I pour out the hot water from my cup and brew a cup of coffee in the Nespresso. If I time it right, breakfast and coffee are ready at the same time, and my coffee is nice and hot for the time it takes to eat my breakfast. A great way to start a day."

Even the instruction manual instructs to unplug it from the wall if it does not operate correctly. (Seriously?!) I ended-up unplugging just about every other cup. It was an absolutely Terrible machine in almost every way. I almost didn’t get the Plus model because of the pitiful Next model… but I did anyway, and am glad I did. So far I haven't had any problem with this model at all. It has actually produced a good beverage everytime I try, which was impossible with the Next model. So if you have to choose between the two, in my opinion there is no choice at all. Go with the Plus model… definitely!"
1637,1.0,2019-02-06,기계 전용, 그레이,My Vertuo Plus didn’t work the first day I tried to use it. I called the Nespresso helpdesk and they told me that Amazon had a defective batch that they refused to return. Don’t buy this junk.

1660,5.0,2019-03-26,기계 전용, 그레이,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas 2019 and we could not be happier with the quality of the coffee and the machine is still brewing away with no problems. Seriously can't go on enough about the taste of this coffee, it's coffee house quality, if you love coffee, you will love this machine.

The Cons:
- The pods are over a dollar each and can't be purchased just anywhere. But still cheaper than Starbucks.
- The de-scaling business is mandatory and confusing and if done incorrectly will shut the machine down and the instruction book could be clearer. I had to call customer service to walk me through the process of button pushing at the right time in the correct order but it was simple once being tutored and they stayed on the phone with me the entire time.
- The pods have to be returned to Nespresso to be recycled but they provide a free shipping bag with a pre addressed, paid label that you can pick up at any Nespresso store or add to any online order.

The Pros:
- My experience with customer service for this product has been AWESOME! They are available anytime you need them and they are so helpful with questions or solutions to problems.
- We order the pods conveniently online and we usually get them between 1-3 days with free shipping over $35. They offer free samples to try with your coffee order.
- The coffee is GOOD, I mean ridiculously good, with many flavors, cup sizes, types of barista blends and espressos. Superior in taste and quality to any other pod coffee.
- It's smart and knows how to brew each type of coffee and it will let you know when your water reservoir needs refilling and when to de-scale
- Aside from learning how to perform the mandatory de-scaling maintenance, this machine is really very easy to use. Open lid, insert pod, close lid, wait for green light, push button, drink hot delicious coffee with beautiful crema with every cup."

It still heats and agitates but as soon as it stops the foam collapses to ""thin soap bubbles"" in appearance and all foam disappears. Called Nespresso and explained problem, they said it was the milk. I explained that we always bought same milk from same store and it had worked fine. However, to make certain, before calling Nespresso, I tried whole milk, 1% low fat, and then Half & Half, ALL instantly collapsed just as the original skim. Agent insisted it was the milk even though I explained that problem started with milk from open container which was sued next day (a gallon lasts us 3 - 4 days). They will do nothing, they insist it is the milk. Utterly unprofessional company marketing a complex machine which they are incapable of technically supporting.

1718,4.0,2018-03-25,기계 전용, 그레이,"Sometimes you need to eat crow. My original review was not very favorable due to the fact you can not reuse the pods. I need to backtrack and say that you can reuse the pods if you do not eject them. However, you will not be very pleased with the results. However they come up with their grind calculations, the pods are spent after being used. Even if you adjust the water lever, which I did, the resulting ""second"" cup is horrifying. While I still disagree with them programming in a code where you can not reuse the pods after ejection, ultimately it doesn't matter. Still, one star off for the first machine being broke and the inconvenience of availability of the pods. Online only, and most are only available thru Nespresso. I have heard that you can buy pods from a Nespresso Boutique, if you can find one. (for the Vertuoline pods)

The first one I bought was broken out of the box. The lid was locked closed and it constantly flashed an amber light. After an hour of wasted time googling, I made another trip to Bed Bath & Beyond to swap it out, where even they determined it was faulty. I ended up taking their display model off the shelf as that was the only one they had left.
I actually LOVE the coffee/alto/lunga/espresso that this machine brews. The froth is WAY better than my friends original model. Here is the issue I have....they have designed the pods to only be used once. This is akin to the home printing manufacturers programming codes into their ink cartridge's so you can't refill and reuse them. This is nothing more than Nespresso's way to get you to buy more pods more often. This machine is electronic in the sense that it uses bar codes on their pods to determine the pod size and relative parameters to brew a perfect cup. I applaud them for this, but to TELL ME that I can't use a pod twice is BULL***!! There are those of you who believe this is perfectly acceptable behavior. Well not me. These pods are 20-30 percent more expensive than the original pods, which of those you can use as many times as you wish, and the Vertuo pods have very limited place of purchases. So now I'm in a quandary whether to keep or return this, yet again, for the original model. I simply do not like it when companies pull this crap. You buy their very expensive machines that use only their expensive exclusive pods, and then I can't get the most out of them. If I want a watered down ""second"" cup of coffee, that should be my decision, NOT yours!! And don't feed me this garbage about it possibly damaging the machine!"

Here are my results after several months of use:
The high spinning of the Vertuo creates a dry coffee foam (they call it crema).
It looks cool but tastes terrible. I have to scoop the foam off before drinking my coffee.
This machine will not dispense hot water only. If you want to add more water to dilute a strong coffee or make a hot chocolate, you are out of luck.
I purchased the variety pack of pods and have yet to find one I really like. They are all quite strong (and I like strong coffee). These are so strong I have to add half/half to dilute."

1722,5.0,2018-12-29,기계 전용, 레드,"The DeLonghi Nespresso VertuoPlus coffee and espresso maker is extremely simple and obvious to operate, brews a good cup of coffee, and a great espresso.

Most people will look at Nespresso machines and will want to compare it to the Keurig coffee pod machines. In a nutshell, Keurig has far more varieties of coffee, the machines cost much less, and the pods are cheaper (per pod $0.45-$0.65 Keurig vs. $1.10 Nespresso). So why would one buy a Nespresso? Well… it comes down to the taste and quality of the coffee and the ability to brew great espresso. The Nespresso coffees that I have tried are rich, with a deeper flavor, and have a delicious crema layer on top. For me, the Nespresso coffee is better than say the Keurig coffees that I have tasted to date..

I like coffee. I’ve owned a classic Nespresso espresso machine also made by  DeLonghi  for almost 6 years. I have a  Bonavita  coffee brewer, and used and discarded an embarrassing number of other devices over the years. When I want to drink a lot of coffee, I brew a pot from local roasters. When I want a quick coffee, I used to use 2 classic Nespresso pods to create an Americano (full cup of coffee from espresso and extra water). NOW, I use the VertuoPlus pods for a cup of coffee.

The coffees and espresso pods.
The VertuoLine pods have a limited selection of coffees and espressos. The DeLonghi machine ships with a variety pack of pods to try. The espressos that I tried were hot, had a nice crema and had a deep and rich flavor. I liked most of the coffees that I tried. They tended to be on the dark, rich side and had a deeper flavor than I have gotten from a Keurig machine. I found that I really did not like any of the flavored coffees that I sampled.

The cost for the espresso pods VertuoLine is $0.85 versus Nespresso classic pods $0.70-$0.80. The VertuoLine coffees are $1.10 per pod. In the past to create a cup of Americano coffee I was using 2 classic Nespresso pods at a time… so the VertuoLine is actually cheaper for a cup of coffee for me.

The pods are only available through Nespresso online or one of the rare local boutique stores. I ordered VertuoLine pods online and was very pleased to see them arrive the next day once and typically 2 to 3 days. The only caveat with the Nespresso VertuoLine pods that I see is that there are not as many varieties of the espresso for the VertuoLine (4 choices) as there are for the Nespresso classic pods (21 choices, ignoring Lungo). There are 10 choices for the coffees. I hope to see the variety grow over time.

Heat of the brew.
Some reviews of other Nespresso VertuoLine machines (not this machine) criticized the lack of heat for the coffee and espressos. I measured the coffee with a good instant thermometer and got temperatures of 161F. This is a hot cup of coffee which made me very happy.

The DeLonghi VertuoPlus Machine.
This machine is an example of simple-to-use functionality with a sleek, elegant design. There is a large water reservoir for the coffee and espressos, and a large discarded pod container (useful because the VertuoLine pods are a bit large). To use the machine, plug it in, hit the button on top (the only button on the machine) to turn it on and then push a wide lever on the front “up” to open the machine (via electric motor). Put the pod in, push the lever down to close the lid (via electric motor) and hit the button on top to brew. The machine takes about 25 seconds to heat up and start brewing. That is it.

A small critique.. I would like the tray that the coffee cup is placed on to be about 3/4"" larger. My mugs for coffee barely fit on the current tray. I am a little concerned that using an electric motor to open and close the lid may cause issues over the years if the motor wears out... especially for something that could be done without a motor (granted, it looks cool).

Overall… this is a great, easy to use, beautiful machine. I am loving the coffee."

Otherwise, coffee is great."
1724,4.0,2020-02-03,기계 전용, 블랙," For more details of how this product is actually used, please see the attached video review. Here is my written review:

This is a very nice machine. My husband and I love all types of coffee and welcomed this machine with open arms. We currently have a regular brewer and a Keurig. One would think that this machine is extremely expensive, but if you compare it to the Keurig, it is actually cheaper, and it is actually on sale via Amazon Prime.

Once again, in comparison to the Keurig, the pods run about the same as far as price is concerned. You can get them here on Amazon, or you can buy them from the Nesperesso website. They even have a members only program that allow you to get these pods, sometimes for a sale price and other goodies you wouldn't normally be able to obtain.

Unboxing: The machine is packaged securely, and it comes with the machine, the water reservoir, the drip catcher and the plug. There are about 4 notches that you can put the drip tray/cup holder on, starting from the bottom to the top. The water reservoir has a suction cup that moves the water from the container into the coffee mechanism. Actual contents: Capsule container, machine, water tank, lid, adjustable water tank arm, adjustable cup support and capsule container.

Simple instructions. You'll need to follow the instructions manual and rinse the machine first by running 27 fl oz of water through the machine.

Coffee preparation instructions: Fill water tank with water, turn the machine on, place cup under coffee outlet, place coffee pod/capsule (flat side up) in machine, carefully push down lid and hit start button.

Things to note: You don't have to force the lid up and down. Once you pull or push softly, it has a soft open and soft close on its own. So too much force may break the mechanism that opens and closes it.

When you open the lid to place ANOTHER capsule in, the machine will automatically eject the old one into the pod dispenser.

There are three sizes of cups recommended for this machine: Alto-14fl oz, Coffee-7.77fl oz and Expresso 1.35fl oz. If you want to top off your cup, you can simply press the start button once more and a little at a time will flow into the cup. Just make sure you have the proper sized cup.

Again, see the attached video for a more visual look at this machine.

I might also add that the machine comes with a capsule sampler that includes 12 capsules. The nicely packaged box gives a background and strength of each pod. I'm gathering that all the red pods are decaffeinated related. The flavors run from Intens (and no, that's not spelled incorrectly), Caramelizi, Elvazi, Giorni, Voltes, Half Caffeinat and Altissi. And before you start wondering if your eyes are playing tricks on you, there are 12 samples, but there are 16 descriptions.

The contents of the box also include instruction manual and a welcome card."

All the parts were carefully packed and obviously high quality. The box of sample capsules looks like a box of Godiva chocolates, complete with detailed descriptions of each type of coffee and espresso, and the ""bonus"" aeroccino milk frother is worth it's weight in gold (more on that later). I drink decaf coffee, and it's so hard to find a coffee that is rich and flavorful. Most of them taste ""flat."" I was truly impressed by both the decaf espresso and decaf coffee capsules. The espresso tasted every bit as wonderful as the best caffeinated espresso I've ever had (before I switched to decaf). My daughter and son drink caffeinated coffee and quickly went through the remaining capsules.My husband says he still prefers his pour over coffee, but he really likes the Nespresso espresso. My daughter, however, prefers the coffee capsules, especially the convenience of popping a one in the machine and drinking a cup of coffee within a minute. Of course the bad news is the expense of replacement capsules. At about $1 a cup, it's cheaper than stopping by a coffee shop but still about twice the price of making pour over coffee (our usual routine). I plan to buy replacement capsules in bulk (after payday...), but I thought I would try re-using the capsules with my own coffee. I ordered  My-Cap's Cap to Reuse Capsules for Nespresso VertuoLine Brewers  and was very pleased with the product. You simply cut the foils off the used capsules, clean them, add your own coffee, cover with a filter, then press in the plastic cap. It took 3 tries to get the right amount of coffee so the machine wouldn't reject it, but now I can get it right every time. It takes a little extra time than it does to just pop in a purchased capsule, but I set it up the night before to save time. Moving on to the aeroccino: you need this in your life! It makes perfect foam each and every time in about one minute with the simple press of a button. I use 2% milk in my lattes and espressos, and the milk is the perfect temperature with a thick, rich foam. Sometimes I will just make a steamer and add some vanilla or flavored syrup (you can make your own-- just google recipes for them). I also use it to make amazing hot chocolate. My daughter puts half and half in the aeroccino and pours it in her coffee so she isn't dumping cold half and half into hot coffee.BTW, the aeorccino that comes with this set is sold by itself for over $200, so it truly is a great bonus item. One last note: be sure that any accessories or pods you buy are specifically made for VertuoLine (not the original line) because the sizes are different."

1731,5.0,2020-07-11,기계 전용, 블랙,"Coffee is now an event in our house. We LOVE this machine. We are moderate coffee drinkers (2 cups ea. in the morning) and never really gave our tired old cup a second thought until we tried a perfect cup of coffee. Honestly, this is by far the best coffee I have ever had.
The machine is 172.00 and is ready to work out of the box. It heats up fast (15-20 seconds) and comes with 8 different coffee's and 4 espresso's so you can get an idea of what you like.
Pods are 1.10 each and cheapest at this time directly from Nespresso, however they often have specials and new machine owners get discounted coffee and a few freebies with your first 3 orders.
Why would you spend over 150.00 for a coffee maker? Or, 1.10 for a cup of coffee? Well, as soon as you taste it you will find out. We ran out of pods for 2 days and I was almost in a panic because they only sell them from Amazon, Nespresso direct and some Targets (but not in our area) I quickly ordered enough to last us at least 3 months.
This is definitely a treat yourself item, and if you love coffee buy it! If you hit a coffee house a few times a week then you will actually save a little money.
*If you are wondering what the difference is between the Originaline vs the Vertuoline , please see more information below, it does a great job explaining what the differences are and why this machine is better, at this time, than the original product (for coffee and espresso only).
The only drawback I have initially is that, at this time, there are no generic pods, which are usually less expensive, and no refillable pods.
When you re-order your coffee from Nespresso they also will send you bags for your used coffee pods which you can then recycle by dropping off at a UPS store or having them pick up. This was very important to me and one of the reasons I never purchased a Keurig. Lastly, I have had Keurig coffee and other pod machines in the past, but the VertuoPlus is by far the better cup of coffee.
If you want to try it before purchasing it, many Williams and Sonoma stores have Nespresso tastings, which will give you an idea how really fantastic the coffee is.
A solid 5 stars and a great way to start out your day by treating yourself!
- Upgrades/differences with VertuoLine vs Originaline from Nespresso.
- Uses centrifusion technology, meaning instead of using a pump to push the coffee out, it actually spins the capsule over 7000 times in a minute making a much better cup of coffee.
- It recognizes each capsule individually and provides the best setting (based on a bar code) for that type of coffee.
- Much faster heat up time, now less than 20 seconds.
- No need to change settings based on coffee strength or espresso, machine does that for you.
- Machine holds up to 14 used capsules which then can be recycled.
- Lastly, automatically turns off after 9 minutes."

1733,5.0,2021-04-01,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I received the Nespresso VertuoPlus by De'Longhi as a Chrismtas Present after adding it to my wish list. I have only had the machine for 1 week now so I will try to update my review in another 6 months to ensure the machine is still working as expected. Other reviews have mentioned the water tank leaking and the temperature not being hot enough for the machine. I have not experienced any leakage and in regards to the temperature it depends on the size of the capsule you are using. I find the coffee and Alto sizes to come out very hot. I have not utilized a lungo size yet but I do agree the espresso does not seem to come out hot and is only warm. I would say this is more so related to the type of cup I am using though. I do not have espresso size mugs yet so I am using a normal size ceramic coffee mug which is very cold to the touch. I think the size of the coffee mug I am using combined with the cold ceramic of the mug and the small ounces of espresso create the ""it doesn't come out hot"" comments. I would recommend getting espresso mugs and then just running them under hot water so the mug is not cold before you utilize with the machine. I plan to order some and try this myself so I will let you know how it works. The taste of the espressos and coffees are amazing and the sample pack that comes with the machine is a great way to get you started to figure out which capsules you like best. I have yet to use the milk frother so again, I will follow-up once I have had the machine a little longer. I hope someone finds this review helpful. =)

Update: It has been a year since I received my machine. I still have not bought espresso mugs to try to see if that helps the espresso come out more hot. However, the coffees still come out very hot and with good froth a year in. I would agree with the milk frother comments that it only warms the milk, it is not very hot so you would definitely want to drink any latte you make immediately.

I still do not have any problems with leakage like other comments have mentioned. I did break the cup holder when I was cleaning it as I dropped it on the floor and one of the slot holders broke off. I called Nespresso customer service and it was very easy to get a replacement. The replacement cost about $9 and it was delivered within $2.

I highly recommend if you are having a problem with any of your machines to call the customer service line. They were very helpful and I got someone right away.

I am very glad I got this machine as a present. My Starbucks spending has good down by at least 75%. $1 per capsule versus $6 per Starbucks Drink, the savings adds up fast."

1736,5.0,2018-12-17,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"There are many ways to make a good cup of coffee, and yes you may be able to produce a superior cup with an Aeropress or other ""bring your own grounds"" coffee makers. There's no denying the convenience of popping in a pod and pressing a button for great coffee. While the Aeropress VertoPlus may look like just another pod based coffee/espresso maker, it's much more.

Unlike the proverbial ""K-Cup"", with Nespresso you're really buying a luxury coffee system. While you can buy 3rd party refillable pods for the Nespresso, if you're thinking of going that way, you're probably not going to get the most out of this system. From the moment you unpack this stunning machine, it's clear that everything is focused around providing a luxury experience. From unpacking to set up, DeLonghi has designed a machine that gives that wow, out of the box experience that you get from brands like Apple.

The machine is really a vehicle for the Nespresso Club, which you sign up for online and has an accompanying app. With the Nespresso Club you get white glove customer service. My test unit had a leaking water tank and the support rep had a new machine in my hands within 24 hours. I didn't have to push or negotiate, that's their standard operating procedure!

The machine itself works flawlessly, from a motorized pod lid to its one-touch operation. The accompanying milk frother is quick and efficient and produces thick foam (with the option for less thick foam). The coffee quality from the Nespresso pods is top notch, you get a sampler pack of 8 coffee pods and 4 espresso pods. Additional pods can be easily purchased via their Club for around $1-$1.80 a pod. This is more expensive than bring your own grounds, but it's still significantly less expensive than a trip to Starbucks.

The Nespresso VertuoPlus does aerate the coffee/espresso at the end of its cycle. This is a little controversial as it boosts the appearance of the crema on the top of the coffee. Some coffee die hards cry foul at this, but this really isn't the system for the real coffee geeks. By aerating the coffee the Nespresso VertoPlus creates an amazingly aromatic and flavorful experience.

Understanding the environmental impact of pods, Nespresso ships a recycling bag which you can fill and return to them in a pre-paid envelope. It's not only a nice touch, it's smart business.

Ultimately, Nespresso has focused laser sharp on providing a luxury coffee experience, while it may be the penultimate coffee experience, it does truly deliver something special. The machine backed by the incredible service behind it make this an option for people who don't want to 'mess' with any part of the coffee experience but who still want an amazing coffee experience."

1741,2.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 그레이,Going on 6 months . Machine can’t connect Bluetooth . I descaled my machine and it shows I still have to descale . Customer service is trash . Either go back to Starbucks or buy another one is your only options . Can’t update firmware or anything .
1742,3.0,2019-03-20,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"UPDATE: We tried for about a month, but this thing just doesn’t make good iced coffee. We ended up buying another Breville to get us by until our stuff gets here. I wish I wouldn’t have wasted $200 giving this thing a shot. If you want real espresso and can swing it, skip this step and go straight for the real deal.

I will preface this by saying we’re spoiled and are used to drinking iced espresso from a $600 Breville machine. This is NOT comparable to that - like, at all (as much as I want it to be). Even drinks from coffee shops aren’t as good as what we’re used to making at home.

We’re military and are moving, meaning we won’t have any of our stuff for a couple months. We wanted something to get us by in the meantime, but we really didn’t want a drip coffee maker or K-Cups. We wanted espresso — strong enough to make our usual iced coffee (8 oz milk with a double shot - nothing super fancy). I did a ton of research and decided this Nespresso was going to be as close as we were going to get.

We’ve been using it for over 2 weeks (2 coffee drinkers), multiple times a day - plenty of opportunity for trial and error. Hot coffee is honestly pretty good. These drinks, I feel, are comparable to a coffee shop. Iced coffee tastes watery, no matter what I do. (Less milk, more coffee, different pods, extra pods, ice, no ice, etc.) It tastes like the coffee and water are just separate, like they really don’t blend together smoothly at all. I feel like I’m drinking coffee water. (Again, this is after multiple attempts and a good $100 in different pods, in addition to what came with the machine).

If you’re NOT used to a full-blown espresso machine or ONLY want hot coffee, this may be the machine for you. If you’re in the market for good iced coffee, you really can’t replicate a true espresso machine using pods (no matter how fancy)."
1743,5.0,2019-01-19,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I entered the Nespresso ecosystem kind of pessimistically. I'm a fan of freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee. The idea of trying coffee from a capsule system ran counter to how I thought coffee should be made. And, I've tried Keurig and have typically been disappointed. But there has been so much buzz surrounding Nespresso that I decided I would give it a try.

The verdict? I love it. I will continue to brew fresh coffee at home, but now I will supplement that with espresso and coffee from my my Nespresso machine. When I want just a single serving of coffee, it's hard to beat the combined convenience and quality of this machine. I will share my experiences so far.

* Setup was simple. I like the detachable water tank because I can take it over to the sink, fill it, and quickly connect it to the machine again (here ""connect"" just means set the tank down. It connects automatically without even a drop of water spilled anywhere). One minor setup complaint/caution: I was trying to open the top of the machine to see where the capsules go. I thought the machine was broke because it wouldn't open. But the problem was that the machine MUST be plugged in, in order to open the top...because it is motorized. I am worried that someone might end up breaking their machine in an effort to open the top without it being plugged in. There is a simple cleaning procedure you should go through before brewing that first cup, but the directions for that are simple.

* Brewing a cup of espresso, or a larger cup of coffee, is simple. Open the top, set a capsule in place, close the top, and press the start button. The machine automatically recognizes whether you are using a small capsule (for espresso) or a larger capsule (for a full cup of coffee), the water used is carefully adjusted for that capsule. It is easy to adjust the cup stand to accommodate the appropriately sized cup for whatever you are drinking. It is possible to adjust the amount of coffee that is brewed from a capsule, and to even change the default amounts. I have not made such adjustments (the defaults are good for my tastes), but the directions are simple for making adjustments.

* The coffee is good! The Nespresso produces an interesting foam at the top of each cup of coffee or espresso. I like that foam. It is not cream, but the texture is creamy as a result. It is not a substitute for adding cream, but I find myself adding cream less often to my coffee when I use the VertuoPlus.

* There are many varieties of coffee to choose from. Nespresso makes the whole process of coffee selection feel...elegant. The packaging of the capsules, the description of the coffee varieties...it all feels kind of classy. Note that there are far fewer places where you can buy Nespresso capsules than Keurig capsules. Keurig I can find anywhere. Nespresso...not so much. So, I end up ordering online (from Amazon, or direct from Nespresso), but there are a few local places where I can get them as well. I appreciate that Nespresso clearly indicates the dates that the capsules were made. If you buy your capsules from a popular source, you are likely to get freshly produced capsules. I have to complain a bit about the price of a cup of Nespresso coffee. It tends to hover around the dollar-per-cup range. Sure, that's less expensive than buying a cup from a local shop. But, it is far more expensive than buying beans and brewing on your own.

* I love that Nespresso offers an easy free way to recycle capsules. You can get an envelope from them that you fill with used capsules and send back to them for free. I appreciate that I don't have to just toss these into a landfill. So, while I complain about the cost of a capsule, if that cost is going toward recycling the capsules, then it's worth it.

* The included Aeroccino 3 milk frother is a nice little bonus. It does not steam milk. But it will heat and froth your milk. I used 1% milk with pretty decent results. There are two options with the frother: short-press the power button to heat and froth, or long-press the power button to just froth. It was a nice addition to my coffee. Nespresso says the frother works best with whole milk. I'm going to try that next.

Sorry for the overly long review. If you are an experienced Nespresso user, then perhaps you already knew all this. But if you are like me...convinced that you can only get good coffee from freshly roasted, freshly ground beans, Nespresso might make a believer out of you. I like this little machine and have already begun ordering more capsules."
1744,1.0,2019-03-13,기계 + 캡슐 세트, 타이탄.,"I've been drinking Nespresso for six years. I've owned a Pixie (great machine), a Vertuo (also a great machine), and now this piece of junk. Granted, the Vertuo machines are designed for obsolescence, since the valves in the centrifuge fail after about three years. But for three years, my Vertuo made perfect coffee with every pod I fed it.

On the other hand, this piece of trash only makes decent coffee when it wants to. It's also ugly, it takes up way too much counter space, and the swinging water reservoir is awkward and it tends to leak. If I had the choice I'd return this machine and get another Vertuo, but I'm past the 30-day return policy so I'll likely sell it and order another one next year.

If you want my advice, if you want to drink coffee and espresso you should skip this cheap piece of plastic garbage and get the original Vertuo machine with the metal top. Or if you just want to drink espresso, get a Pixie. The Pixie will last forever and you can always make an Americano by adding hot water to whatever it pours."

The instruction manual is a joke, with light font and all languages mixed together. I plugged it in, put the pod in and pressed the coffee button, nothing happens. I even tried waiting in case it needed to heat up, and opening and closing the top again, but still nothing!! Don't waste your money. I ended up using my Keurig yesterday and today. Guess this is a lesson to be careful what you think you want."
1747,5.0,2022-01-30,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I'm a newbie to the espresso game, but I just moved into a new place and wanted to get a machine. I avoided the costly ones and went for the basic DeLonghi set up, with a milk frother. That machine pales in comparison to the Nespresso. For a beginner, I wanted a simple one-button espresso maker. I realize the DeLonghi is a more traditional espresso maker where you do the process yourself, the need to monitor the machine so it doesn't overflow is annoying if you want to step away. Though it can add up over time, I decided to go with a pod machine after my DeLonghi experience.

The Nespresso fits my needs perfectly. It looks sleek, the set up and cleaning is super easy. It's inexpensive and honestly, the Nespresso pods have such a distinct variety and good flavors that I don't need to venture outside the brand. I love the simplicity of this machine and how good it tastes. 10/10 in my opinion honestly. I feel like I got something with real value because the cost is in the range of other inexpensive espresso machines but this one operates super clean and looks great."
1748,3.0,2017-11-15,기계 전용, 그레이,"We bought this machine for the opportunity to make 14 ounce coffees. They were the best! However, Nespresso has DISCONTINUED ALL 14 OZ PODS!! The machine is worthless to us after only 18 months. I feel duped by Nespresso."
1749,5.0,2019-01-13,기계 전용, 그레이,"But I didn't want to put another store out of business also I am super impatient so I bought it at Macy's for $161 and now it's going for $116! Damn and I thought I got a good deal.

I truely love this thing. It makes coffee (5oz and 7oz cups) double espresso, espresso (three different blends/intensities) and altos (14oz I suppose you could use for multiple cups and only waste one pod vs 2 but you'd have to stand there and switch before it over pours. It's obviously for a thermos but you can do either!)

It has so many flavors to choose from (coffee wise, including decaf) I just don't like that some pods are labeled with just the logo of N. I have no idea what to expect when I use them. But for the ones with labels it makes it a lot easier to pin point what I like and want to order more of. I love foam and frothy drinks but if you don't like a frothy coffee this isn't for you. You can always scoop out the foam from the coffee but some of it WILL linger.

Aside from coffee flavors and options it looks beautiful and sleek and hardly takes up space on my counter!

As for the milk frother that comes with it, I have never in my life had such foamy and frothy steamed almond milk! I am beyond impressed! I mean BLOWN AWAY! That one aspect was worth every over paid penny! It will also froth your milk cold for iced drinks

Aside from coffee options, design and the aeroccino-
It's so easy to use! Pop a pod in and wait! Love it!

It does come with a sampler but it's confusing as hell for what's what. Also, I found if you are a prime member it is worth getting yiur pods through prime. 50 pods for under $45 is a great price. They also have variety packs and if you're prime you get free shipping unlile the nespresso website offers. Lastly- they have a recycling system they walk you through how to set it up but everything is 100% recyclable which is why I chose this product. I heard Keurig is a pain to recycle. And apparently you can reuse the pods with your own espresso/coffee but you have to tamper with them a bit. Some say its as easy as resealing. Hopefully they make a reusable pod soon!"
1750,5.0,2018-07-16,기계 전용, 그레이,"This machine works with the Nespresso “Vertuoline” coffee pods.

Yes it’s true...

This 100% is the closest cup of coffee to being in a French cafe.

It’s a very simple machine for the user, although it is packing some advanced and interesting technology inside.

Each coffee pod has a barcode around the perimeter which holds the information that programs the coffee machine based on the style of coffee you’ve chosen to brew, you just inserted the pod, close the lid, and press brew button.

I’ve attached a handy chart created by a Reddit user, which shows coffee blends, brew styles, caffeine content, pod color & names.

From what I understand, the pod is spun at very high speeds (above 10k RPM). My GUESS is the centrifugal forces simulate high brewing pressure while also aerating the coffee and creating a perfect thick crema.

I do have a discrepancy with either amazon or the manufacturer.. it seems they have multiple versions of the same model. Varying locations of the De’Longhi and Nespresso logos, and varying chrome accents around the holding tray. Difference only seem aesthetic, but stock photos on listing don’t represent the exact machine customers are receiving.

I’ll update the review regarding this discrepancy (if I get to the bottom of it). My initial hunch is either old inventory is being sold OR a new redesigned unit is being sold.

I DO prefer the look of unit in the stock (advertised) photos which shows the De’Longhi logo on the top of the machine with the nespresso logo on the bottom and the black tray.

Regardless, this coffee is the bomb.

Some more subjective thoughts..

Premium coffee comes at a premium price (relatively speaking based on “pod style” coffee brewing systems) but if you can curb your coffee habits away from those even more expansive options like Starbucks or your local hip coffee bar, this system is FAR cheaper and MUCH MUCH more premium.

Time.. yes, it takes valuable time to brew the perfect cup of coffee. About double the amount of time your common Kurig takes, that’s over a solid minute sometimes.

Pod availability & purchasing convenience.. I get my Vertuoline pods either online or at Macy’s. That’s it. You can’t just run to wallworld or Costco or really any normal grocer to grab some pods if your low and in a snag. (At least with my experience in central Florida)

Overall I’m very happy with this buy, and as (almost) always I got an amazing price on Amazon!"
1751,4.0,2019-03-02,기계 전용, 블랙,"I am a huge fan of the original Nespresso capsules and most all of the machines that use the original, smaller capsules. I have been inquisitive about these larger capsules for larger cups of American-style cups of coffee. To get a larger cup of coffee, we very often use two of the original capsules at one time, using a little more water than an espresso calls for. I know that one of the Vertuo capsules is cheaper than two of the Original. Finally gave this Vertuo a try and am a bit disappointed.

The machine works very well: Efficient, quick, fairly quiet, easy to clean and maintain. You push a button and that's it. The crema is very thick, (almost seems like fake crema....). What makes it ""Plus"" and ""Deluxe"" is the fact that you can make both larger cups of coffee and espresso with the push of a single button. Nespresso makes two sizes of Vertuo capsules and this machine reads the label to add the right amount of water.

It's the Vertuo capsule coffee that falls short of my expectations. Out of all the blends that are offered, (I think we tried 16--twelve 8 ounce capsules and four espresso capsules), and I personally only like maybe 3-4 of them. Am I spoiled by the Original Nespresso capsules? Probably so. So beware, if you are used to the Regular Nespresso coffee blends, you may be disappointed in the Vertuo blends, too. Plus, there are many more blends and flavors to choose from in the Regular line."
1752,4.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"From the moment I took this out of the box, I knew that it was something special. The coffee maker itself looks sleek and beautiful. It looks and performs like the espresso machine from the future. It is black with chrome accents and has a very expensive, luxury look. The capsule lid is motorized and works with one touch. It is very smooth, quiet, and flawless. After the coffee is made the empty capsule is delivered into a bin on the back for easy removal. The water tank swivels so that you can make it fit to your particular cabinet or shelf situation. The drip tray can be adjusted to fit different heights of coffee cups or accommodate a short espresso cup. We have large coffee mugs, and they were right up against the machine. Regular size cups would work perfect. The “Milk Frother” is 5-star. The set up comes with a starter kit of different coffees and they are very good. Of course we like the stronger ones. It is not a coffee maker that we can use on a daily basis but on the weekends, we really enjoy making a specialty coffee with the froth on top. The capsules, I think, are very expensive and have to be ordered online. That is another reason that we would not use this luxury coffee maker every day.

Please Note: Nespresso has two different capsules. Depending upon which machine you have is which capsule you will need. The “original” and the “VertuoLine”. This machine uses the “VertuoLine” capsules. It will NOT use the “original” line. The “original” capsules can be found in many places including some “big-box” stores. I have yet to find the “VertuoLine” capsules anywhere other than online. Many different companies offer “compatible” “original” capsules. . . . Not so with the “VertuoLine” capsules, or at least not yet. I think one of the reasons is that the “VertuoLine” capsules have a barcode around the edge. I’m sure that Nespresso wanted to try and stop all the other companies from making money off their machines, so they made a new capsule that can’t be duplicated (or at least not yet).

One more thing. . . De’Longhi makes a lot of different coffee machines. Many of them are the more “fancy” sort of machines where you can use your own beans. Some of them are a bit pricey. . . Some are more reasonable. But in the end, because you can use your own beans, and don’t have to pay over a buck per-cup (as you do with Nespresso) . . .it can be more affordable even with the higher cost of the machine. But this Nespresso machine certainly makes it easy."
1753,4.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"We've had this machine a little over one year and have enjoyed every cup of coffee made with it. We normally make 2-4 cups of coffee a day.

Unfortunately it started leaking coffee down the back of the machine just after it went out of warranty. We've tried descaling it multiple times but no luck on fixing the problem. I then did some searching and found that someone had fixed the problem by removing the rubber/silicone ring in the top that clamps down on the coffee pod, putting some plumbing tape/teflon tape on it and reinstalling the ring. I attempted to remove the ring but found that ours had hardened up and was coming apart as I tried to remove it. The ring never broke in two but would still make a seal so I just stuffed it back up into its slot without ever being able to put any tape on it and thought for sure I would be buying a new machine. I then tried making a cup just to see what would happen and what do you know, no leak.

Fast forward a few weeks and the original machine has been leak free since then. I suspect the rubber or silicone ring in the top of the unit either compresses from use or hardens up due to pressure and heat and doesn't seal on the pods properly after a lot of usage. It's possible that just pulling that ring down a little a little will fix the problem but I'd like to find either an OE or universal ring that would fit."
1754,5.0,2019-10-11,기계 전용, 블랙,"Before I jump into a review, I'll say one thing: I never thought something would supplant my Keurig. Ever.

But the Nespresso VertuoPlus has. And pretty easily.

While I drink coffee for the energy boost it gives me in the morning as a large reason for doing so, I genuinely enjoy the taste of a good cup of coffee. Keurig brewers, even when using your own fresh ground beans, never really got me close to that. Don't get me wrong; I still think there's a lot of room for a Keurig in a house...in most houses, probably. But after the first time I tasted a Nespresso brew, I knew the Keurig and I were breaking up.

The Nespresso VertuoPlus is, in short, a Keurig for people that like better coffee. You pay for it, but overall, I think it's incredibly worth it. The VertuoPlus works almost identically to a Keurig. You pick your pod. Open the machine. Pop it in. And press go. There are, however, some major differences.

For one, the VertuoPlus delivers the amount of water you need based on your pod. There are sensors that figure this out for you, but at our house we just call it coffee magic. The coffee magic determines how much should be poured (there currently three sizes Nespresso offers) and brews your coffee (or espresso) for you within 2-3 minutes, complete with a lovely creama. The Nespresso has a centrifuge system that helps achieve this and also makes the coffee taste pretty phenomenal. Once you're done, the system has a receptacle at the back that will hold your empties, that Nespresso will actually recycle for you for free.

The Nespresso has a few shortcomings, but they all have to do with acquiring their pods. First, they are more expensive than Keurig pods. Where you can get K-cups for .30-60 cents per cup, a Nespresso pod will run you about $1 a piece. If you're willing to pay for better tasting coffee, you're probably willing to spend a little more. The larger issue is availability. Both Amazon and Nespresso offer online services, but it is frustrating sometimes when I can't just run to the grocery to get them.

Despite the issue of availability, the VertuoPlus has become my go-to coffee machine when I don't have time to press my own. The machine is reasonably priced, works incredibly well, and brews a very nice cup of joe.

Highly Recommended"

I LOVE it and recommend it to every one I talk to. My wife bought the VertuoPlus with the Frother for me for my birthday and this is by far the best gift I've received and again in the long run this will save you money. 10 pods in a sleeve for like a dollar a pop, so inexpensive for such delicious coffee. I now no longer have a coffee problem more of a Nespresso problem. I have bought so many sleeves I don't know how long it will take me to drink them all. Lol"
1756,1.0,2022-08-08,기계 전용, 레드,"I had this for about one year (approximately one cup per day) until it encountered problems. At one point, it stopped brewing the correct amount and just kept brewing until the entire reservoir was empty. I checked everything but only hit the button one time and nothing changed. To fix this, I decided to descale the machine and did everything the way it was written in the manual. After exiting descaling mode, it continued to have problems brewing the correct size (or brewing at all). I searched online for days - because I do love this coffee. Eventually I found a way to do a factory reset of the machine. That actually fixed the problem... for about 2-3 months. In the last few weeks it started having problems again brewing the incorrect size. Now, the machine won't even turn on (seriously I tried EVERYTHING - including checking my fuse box, resetting the outlet, moving it to another one, etc.). While the machine makes good coffee, it has some serious issues and should last longer than one year (especially for the price). My advice: pass on this and buy a better machine."
1757,5.0,2018-01-12,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"This is an impressive coffee/espresso maker for the price! I don't think of myself as being mechanically inclined nor a fancy-coffee-maker so I was a little hesitant about ordering this from Vine and being able to set it up quickly and use it. Luckily, Nespresso made it very easy. I took it out of the box right away, read the instructions for about 5 minutes, and started setting it up. Within 20 minutes (after doing a rinse cycle, per the directions, I was already making a frothy cup of coffee, easily following the directions in the booklet with minimal frustration.

Instead of doing an all new review, a few take-aways, building off of others' comments:

*I found the water reservoir to be relatively convenient. By being off to the side, I was able to put it a little farther back on our counter, which is great for our very limited counter space.
*This does fill to the very top of our mugs on a normal pour. I do like cream in my coffee, especially the frothed milk with the handy frother. A simple fix was to press the button once when I wanted it to stop early. I was then easily able to accommodate the cream/frothed milk.
*The coffee pods are pretty expensive, which kind of nixes this as our everyday coffee maker. We will likely kick this one out on weekends and/or long holidays. We are teachers so we have some long holidays where it would be worth lugging it in and out of the garage to use it for a couple weeks or even a couple months during our summer break. We will continue to use our regular coffee maker for our every-day coffee. The pods come out to about 75 cents each- cheaper than a Starbucks, for sure, but too much for a regular cup. For those that like to visit a coffee shop every day, it may be worth getting the pods for every-day use.

The milk frother is very easy to use and takes little time to set up and clean. I do not like to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning, so this is a must for me.

The coffees are excellent and Nespresso does a good job of describing each in the included variety pack, especially along the intensity scale. My husband and I were able to find several coffees that we are happily ordering again for those weekend/holiday coffees.

This is an excellent wedding/new house gift, or just a self-indulgent splurge."
1758,5.0,2019-02-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Yes, I know it's expensive. Yes, I know the pods aren't readily available.
But if you love coffee (and I was born with a cappuccino ladle in my mouth), this is an incredible machine!
It's very easy to use--after the first cleaning operation which lasts a few minutes--select a pod, touch the tab and up the top goes exposing a receptacle for that pod. Slip it in, touch the tab downwards and it's ready to go. I really like how fast the water gets heated so that it is ready to make a cup very quickly, certainly under a minute. This is really, really good coffee and you can tell this as the aroma hits your nose as it's brewed. One thing to be careful of, my machine does not reliably eject the used pod so watch for that. Before slipping in a new pod, the old should hit the used pod receptacle at the back of the machine with a soft thunk. If you don't hear that, it won't close on the new pod, stopping with a red light error condition. What has worked is to press the tab up again and it'll properly eject the pod.
Most of the pods in the welcome pack I can do without although for testing purposes I tried them out. I'm not a fan of decaffeinated coffee but even those tasted good. The head/crema on the coffee in the cup is glowing and sumptuous. Add some milk to that from the included milk frother and you're in heaven. The frother, or the Aeroccino 3 to call it by its proper name, uses some kind of magnetic levitation to whisk milk into a foam that is solid and won't break apart. This is real coffee house stuff here.
There's just nothing I don't like about this machine and if the pods were readily available and reasonably priced, this would garner an easy 10 stars. As it is, I'm going to have to settle for the 5. If you're a coffee fiend, you're going to get this machine, period."

Called Nespresso, said it's their standard design. Love the frother."
1760,5.0,2021-05-17,기계 전용, 레드,"I have an unhealthy obsession with coffee, so was excited to try out this machine! The machine was simple to set up. Just stick the water reservoir on, swivel the water reservoir to the desired position, and run several cups of water through the machine to clean out any debris. Cleaning the machine is a somewhat animated activity. All you need to do is fill the reservoir and the machine does the rest.
This machine can make either regular coffee or Expresso. There are two different size capsules to use. The larger capsules are for coffee and the smaller is for brewing Expresso. All drinks are brewed with around a fourth of an inch of foam or creme on top. I don't believe there is a way to eliminate the foam, if that is not your thing.
The coffees from the variety pack are displayed beautifully and seem to be all full bodied. If you are a fan of Keurig coffee, this may not be the cup of coffee for you. It definitely does not have that watered down taste!

The pods are a bit difficult to come by. Some specialty stores sell them, but Amazon of course is a good choice. The pods average around $1 a piece, which is still cheaper then a artisan coffee from your local coffee shop.
One feature I am absolutely in love with on this machine is, the top off function. The machine is programmed to make 8 oz cups of coffee, but if you prefer a bit larger cup of coffee, you can push the Brew button at the end of brewing and the machine will keep going. A second cool feature this machine offers is, that it disposes used pods on its own into a receptacle in the machine. This saves you from having to constantly take single trips to the trash to get rid of your old capsule.
Overall, this is a fantastic machine that quickly makes coffee shop quality coffee. If you are a high end coffee addict, this may be the machine for you. I can't wait what else they come up with in the future!"

The only thing that confused me was opening the top, where the capsules are inserted. As it turns out, it opens and closes via an electric motor, so of course it won't work unless it's plugged in. Also, the little attachment that goes in the bottom of the frother is very small - much smaller than I expected - so I spent some time looking for some larger attachment in the box.

Once assembled, you need to run it through an auto-clean cycle, which the instruction manual will walk you through. After that's done it's time to make coffee. It comes with about a dozen capsules, each a different flavor. This selection doesn't cover the entire line of flavors available from Nespresso, but I think there are only about four that are left out. It's very easy to use, just put some water in the jug which attaches to the side, press up on the lever on the front to open the top (which will automatically eject any old capsules and drop them in the bin on the back), and drop your new coffee capsule into the holder. Close that, place a cup on the holder on the front, press the start button on top and wait just a couple of minutes for your coffee to be dispensed. At the same time, you can put a bit of milk into the frother and let that run - it should be done in plenty of time for your coffee.

We've sampled quite a few flavors from those provided, and quite simply love them. They are strong of course - that's why you add the cream from the frother. My only complaint is that this brand of capsules is not available in any of our local stores, so you'll have to order them from Amazon. I don't mind the price too much, it's certainly much less expensive than going to a coffee house, but of course much more expensive than making ordinary coffee.

Overall it's a beautiful machine, it works quickly and the espresso is delicious. Cleaning is very easy as well. It's a wonderful addition to our kitchen and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced machine for their home."
1764,4.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 블랙,"This does everything it notes. The Nespreso obviously won't give the flavor of a well-poured, freshly mixed brew but it's OK for large groups, for people who use milk and sugar anyway, or for those who prefer flavored coffees.
Taste aside, my main concern is the same as for other similar coffee makers, and that's how the heating apparatus can clog with mineral sediment (and bacteria) fairly regularly (coffee is a good medium for this). I'd clean it out with lemon juice or dilute vinegar (or your own favorite cleaner) followed by a couple of water rinses now and then, and I would suggest doing this before you brew your first cup (it's manufactured in the usual place, so product safety should be a consideration).
This is a capsule-type machine, so you are sort of locked in to buying more of the manufacturer's capsules. I haven't tried to rig the machine so you can re-use your capsules with a favorite blend. The company does provide a bag to mail in used containers if you think the plastic bag, and the fuel used to mail it with, are sound trade-offs. If you don't use the machine frequently, you may consider that coffee has a rather short unrefrigerated shelf-life unless you use preservatives. Also, keep in mind that your ecological footprint will be somewhat larger with a capsule machine, if that matters to you."
1765,5.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I've never owned a coffee maker, and to be honest, I've never wanted one. I like my Starbucks. But there are some Saturday and Sunday mornings that I just don't want to get out of bed and go get coffee ... And I have to have my coffee. Sure, I could send my husband, but when I do that, I have to order off the menu and it costs more money. When the opportunity arose to get the VertuoPlus, I could hardly contain my glee - it makes espresso! That's what I drink from Starbucks! It came with the Aeroccino 3 milk frother! I only make iced coffee drinks, but still - maybe one day I'll want a cup of hot coffee. Imagine my surprise to learn that the Aeroccino 3 does hot AND cold frothing! The machine is very simple to use, starting with a hot water rinse prior to brewing your first delicious cup. There aren't a lot of buttons or settings or things to fuss over - you just pop the pod into the machine, push a button, pour your milk or cream into the Aeroccino 3, push a button, and about a minute later you have a beautiful cup of coffee and a beautiful, foamy hot or cold milk to add in. As for the flavors, I have tried three of the pods that came in my sampler box, which I made all iced and with almond milk. I didn't really care for any of the coffees ... When Monday came back around and it was time to head to Starbucks, I told myself that surely my espresso would taste better with the almond milk than the Nespresso coffee had been. I was wrong. Apparently almond milk renders all coffee teetering on the brink of undrinkable. Now I have a pint of Half & Half in my fridge at home and the almond milk has been repurposed to make my breakfast. I could go on forever about how amazing and wonderful this coffee maker is, but I have a lot of work to do so I'm going to leave you with this: I truly believe it is a purchase you will not regret."

We would frequent our local coffee house and would spend about $6 per drink, this is a do it at home, make it the way you want for way less the price. Get a frother and you can make your own foam or flavors to customize."
1767,1.0,2018-08-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"As for the coffee this machine makes it's pretty good for the most part. So far I've only tried the few samples that came with it. About a third of them I didn't care for at all. And that's not all that I don't like about it. The bad part of having this machine is the capsules for it are very expensive and I haven't been able to find them at any store around here or anyplace other than on Amazon and they are suppose to be available on the special Nespresso Club website. Haven't got around to checking that out yet. The biggest fault of this machine is it uses only the special coffee pods or capsules that are made just for this machine. They start at $11 for 10 of the same kind and the price quickly goes up from there. I've seen some for $22.50 for 10 and up to $45.00 for only 10. I don't know about anyone else but $4.50 for a cup of coffee is way too much for me. For me to pay that much for coffee it better be in a 24oz mug and taste so gooood that it can almost give me an orgasm, and a all day high! Now if the pods for it were a competitive price with all the other Nespresso pods that don't work with this machine, like under $1 each and several at .50¢ each and available at Walmart, King Soopers, Safeway, and other stores I would give this machine a 5 * rating.
The machine itself works pretty good. Except mine leaked a big puddle of water on my counter the first time I used it. It's very simple to use. Just make sure you put water in the holding tank, press up on the lever on the front and the motor drive opens it. Drop a pod in it, press down on the little lever and it closes with the motor drive. Wait for the green light on top to stay on then lightly press the little button with the green light. Make sure your cup is under the spout on the front first though. It does its thing and fills your cup with coffee. It only takes a couple of minutes to brew any cup of coffee that you have the pods for with little to no fuss no mess. Cept maybe some water on the counter. It's too bad that the special coffee pods for it are so expensive and are only available by ordering them online then have to wait for the mail to get them to you.
I did find a kit on Amazon that you can use to reuse the pods with your own coffee. I ordered one of them so that I can use my own favorite brand of coffee and maybe try some beans and grind my own coffee to make my own pods.
UPDATE
I'm now more familiar with my machine and I'm tempted to change my rating to just one star. First, the problem with this thing leaking water all over the counter is worse than I thought it was. This thing leaks all the time that it still has water in the tank! Ignore it long enough and it will leak the whole container of water out onto the counter. The other problem is with the coffee pods. About 1 out of 10 the machine will reject. Put the pod in, set my mug under the spout, close the top and press the little button, light flashes green a couple of times, then goes red and shuts off. No idea why it didn't finish the cycle. Put another pod in it and it works fine. Any where from 6 pods to 12 pods later and it does it again. It rejects at least 1 to 2 pods out of every ten and that's just throwing money away.
Once I use up the pods I have left this thing is going back in it's box and going out to the shed where I store all the other things that I have that don't work like they are suppose to. Then I'm going to take the money that I would have wasted on pods for the reject and buy a new Mr Coffee machine for good old regular coffee."

It has plugged on me and had to refer to online manual to figure out descaling. Then the lid would not open, and there is no way to manually open it. Had to send it in. Although the customer service is great, I would rather not have to use it. Can't wait to get the machine back for the great coffee, but would like a more bullet proof machine."

But based upon the fact that I was a part owner of a coffee shop in Oregon, I have some experience with espressos, single origin and blended coffees. My issues are these:
1.) There is very little distinction in flavor between Nespresso's espresso pods. The same is true with their coffee pods.
2.) Every single pod consistently spews out foam. For some drinks, foam is appropriate. For an Americano? No. For a basic cup of coffee? Blech!"
1770,5.0,2019-07-23,기계 전용, 블랙,"There is a lot to like with the Nespresso Vertuo Plus Deluxe Coffee and Expresso Machine.
The set up is simple but make sure to read the directions because the first step is to prep/clean the machine. Also, make sure you use a light touch for the off/open /close lever.
I've been using the Nespresso machine for a few weeks and I love it. It sure beats going to Starbucks!
The coffee tastes so smooth, creamy and overall delicious.
""Nespresso VertuoLine Coffees are characterized by rich, generous foam called crema - naturally formed during the brewing process, thanks to our new Centrifusion™ technology. The unique centrifuge action of the Nespresso VertuoLine ensures you get every drop of flavor from each Nespresso capsule. Just insert a capsule and close the lever, when activated, the capsule spins up to 7,000 rotations per minute, blending ground Coffee with hot water and producing the perfect crema to complement your favorite Coffee or Espresso.""
It only takes a few minutes and my morning coffee has me ready to go!
I love the water canister that holds enough water for several uses (64 oz.)
The Nespresso reads each capsule so it knows exactly what to do. I did buy a separate milk frother so I could experience the lattes and cappuccinos fully. According to the Nespresso website, adding milk creates a whole new taste sensation, as well as bringing soft, smooth and creamy textures to the coffee.
For an even more indulgent experience, start by pouring about 2 oz (50ml) of milk in your cup and brew your coffee over it. I can definitely taste the creaminess described, Nespresso coffees are a whole new level that you, (IMO), can't compare to K-Cup like coffees.
I also like how on the Nespresso website it gives you a breakdown of the different coffee and espresso; their intensity, flavor, and smoothness.
Nespresso 's website has a variety of coffees but the sample pack included gives you a great idea of the diversity of the coffees. When the machine finishes making a cup of coffee it discards the capsule in a collection bin which is convenient. Nespresso also offers to recycle the coffee capsules, you can send the empty capsules in the bag Nespresso supplies but you have to request it."
1771,1.0,2018-02-23,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"We got this from our registry and after 6 months of use, the machine has completely stopped working. I loved the coffee this machine makes and we have tried absolutely everything from factory resetting to using different outlets. It just completely stopped working. It's a waste of money and you are better off going with a more reliable model. When it worked it was great, but I think the quality of product is very low and I wish I could tell you it was something fixable."
1772,5.0,2021-02-02,기계 전용, 블랙,"I was not prepared for how good this coffee/espresso maker really is. I own and use a Tassimo daily and have used other Nespresso (espresso-only) coffee makers as well as various Keurigs. Hands down this is the best ""pod-based"" coffee maker I've ever used.

There are a few reasons for this. First, this unit takes pods for both coffee and espresso. The pods have the same base (so they fit the machine), but different sized shells so that they have the right amount and grind of coffee for the drink they are making. The base of the pods has what is essentially bar code that tells the machine how to brew that coffee. Finally, this machine doesn't just force hot water/steam down through the pod (like my Tassimo or a Keurig). Instead, it swirls the hot water/steam around the pods. This creates an insane amount of crema while still giving you a strong coffee or shot of espresso.

The machine is a breeze to set up and use. The holding tray for your cup can be adjusted to the best height you need from a demitasse cup to a large coffee mug. Coffee is dispensed outwards from the machine, so even very large mugs can be used (not so for my Tassimo). The water reservoir is good sized and visible from the front, so it is easy to see when it must be refilled. To open and close the pod holder, just tap the front ""handle"". It is motorized and slides open and shuts at a touch.

Some folks mentioned only being able to get pods from Amazon. Target also sells the pods as do some Macys. And of course you can order direct from Nespresso. The only disappointment for me is that you really can only do coffee and espresso. My Tassimo has chocolate, milk, and tea pods as well and we've found that versatility to be handy at times.

Finally, Nespresso has a recycling program for their pods, so you can get a bag for your used pods and send them back, free of charge. I really like that as it eliminates one of the issues with these pod-based machines"

1774,4.0,2017-09-26,기계 전용, 그레이,"So far I’m very happy with the quality and the amount of effort It takes to make a cup of coffee with this Nespresso machine. My one and only compliant would be: “how incredibly wasteful, and limiting these machines pod business model can be”

The pods can easily become a very expensive habit, especially if you have multiple people using them. They claimed to be recycle pods, but still an awful amount of plastic waste being produced by one person on a daily basis.

I ended up buying a third party reusable pod for my machine and so far it has been working great. I’m just a bit disappointed with the fact that Nespresso doesn’t have their own reusable pods yet, if they are truly confident about their products they should have offered the costumer with this option by now...anyways

In summary, this is a great espresso machine for all those coffee fanatics out there, but I highly recommend buying a third party reusable pod. You will save yourself a lot of money and you won’t have to deal with the hassle of ordering Nespresso pods every month."

1776,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"Pretty nice. Have a different Nespresso model at the office - so this was nice to compare. Nice features, then opening the top, press lever and it opens automatically (other model does not; although it did seem to stick a couple of times, will watch that). The water reserve tank is also nice that it is moveable. I have this unit next to my Keurig, and it does not take up much room at all because I have the water tank in the back/hidden.

The frothing unit is a big bonus. Easy. And very cool. Actually, you can do hot or cold milk froth (I'm using soy milk and it froths nicely); nice, creamy, thick. I start the frothing thing first, then the coffee; they get done about same time. I have it sitting sort of in front/in between the two coffee makers.

Now -- for the actual coffee. Have tried a few now -- regular coffee and the expresso. GOOD! I've added froth topping (hot and cold) to regular coffee/really good. I made express this AM and mixed w/frothed milk for a nice ""expresso latte"". Great. Since the pod/capsules are a little pricy, trying to use regular Keurig days/and Nespresso nights (I like nice cup of coffee at night). Although that morning expresso was really good.

All in all, pretty nice. (but more expensive than Keurig on a regular basis -- and I drink a lot of coffee)"
1777,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,"My Cuisinart 12-cup Grind and Brew died and decided to get a different brand of coffeemaker. It made decent coffee, but the carafe had a big lip on it that was always spilling coffee. Have a Keurig in the office that makes okay coffee-not as good as Cuisinart but less messy. Decided to try a Nespresso and glad I did as there is a world of difference in taste. Nespresso makes coffee that you savor; can't say that about Cuisinart or Keurig coffee.
However Nespresso coffee is more expensive than Keurig-approximately $1/pod versus $.50/pod and not as widely available. Also you don't have a choice in amount with Nespresso-you can only make the amount specified by the particular pod versus Keurig where you can choose between small, medium, or large cup per pod.
It really comes down to how important the taste of your coffee is to you. Very important-get a Nespresso and order the pods from their website for the best selection and price. Not important-get a Keurig, Mr. Coffee, Cuisinart, etc."

My beef is that after I order it i have to sign up and log in to website to get a tracking number.

Chill out nespresso send the pods and the tracking in an email. Thinking you special because of brad pitt? Oh youre special, you're a star even.... 1 star out of 5."
1779,5.0,2020-02-08,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"First off, I don't use this machine every day. I grind my own coffee beans every morning for a normal pot of coffee, and that is what I drink during the week. But I've had Nespresso at other people's houses, and I always thought it would be lovely to have for mornings when I'm off work, for a weekend, or for a special occasion. I always talked myself out of getting it, though, because of the price of the machine and the price of the pods.

I finally decided to get this, though, mostly because it comes packaged with the Aeroccino frother as well, and I'm so sorry I didn't just get it sooner. The quality of the Nespresso pods is outstanding. i've used 75% of the complimentary pods so far, and I haven't had one yet that I didn't like. It will be a challenge to decide which ones to replace when I order more. I have only used the milk frother once so far, but it produced an incredible, silky foam that made me feel like I'd spent $5.00 on my drink.

I honestly can't imagine using this every single day, because of the price of the pods, but it has worked out the way I expected: I use it almost every Saturday morning to treat myself to a wonderful cup of coffee, and I've made a handful of lattes and cappuccinos on days off from work.

If you're waffling on whether or not this is worth the price, I think it is, especially with the frother. And even though the Nespresso pods are both pricey and proprietary, the incredible cup of coffee or shot of espresso you get is well worth it. This is not just an expensive Keurig, it's a lovely addition to any home coffee bar."
1780,5.0,2017-07-29,기계 전용, 레드,"If you love GOOD coffee, any Nespresso coffee setup is for you. Pricewise, you'll save money replacing Starbucks with these $1.10 pods. (That's saving at least half of what a coffee cost at the local cafe.) You'll get crema, coffee in under 2.5 minutes, and 24 flavors to choose from right from the convenience of your home. I'm a coffee purist--no milk, sugar, etc. These coffees are really good, but you have to try a lot from the sampler to find the perfect cup for you. The descriptions are helpful.

This entry-level machine is quiet and it doesn't take up that much room. The interface is basic and not overwhelming. Easy 3-stip coffee process is convenient. I can't believe how high quality the coffee is!

There is a lot of technology you don't see in the machine. I hope it never fouls up: lots of codes if it does! [knocking on wood] But this technology and quality bean selection is the reason why it tastes s good. I call it the Dre Beats of coffee makers because I think that THIS is the way coffee was meant to taste like. High quality and pure. I have to limit myself to 2 cups or I'd be drinking coffee all day! Mornings are a joy and I look forward to my first cup.

Side Note: I'm pretty sure Nespresso's machines are made by DeLonghi--this one is despite not having any branding on it (except Nespresso at the top). If you get it on Amazon, it will say DeLonghi. If you get the same machine at the Nespresso store, DeLonghi logo will be replaced by Nespresso.

So far, I can't offer any improvements. I do have one preference they should consider though: a flat plug so it doesn't stick out of the wall (my setup is different)."
1781,5.0,2019-02-12,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I'll start this review by saying that I found no negatives (outside of coffee pod prices) for the Nespresso VertupPlus Deluxe coffee and espresso maker.

From the moment I set this up and made my first cup of absolutely silky smooth coffee it was love at first sip. The coffee maker is easy to setup and it warms water in less than 30 seconds. Once you place one of the pods in the machine the motorized lid closes and you hit the button. The Nespresso injects water and swirls it around the coffee until it come out of the spout with a delicious foam. I can't say enough good things about this coffee. It's smooth, and just about every pod (from the sample set) I tried was delicious. Even the decaf is good.

The foamer is an odd duck but it does the job. You pour in milk, although my girlfriend prefers coconut milk, and push the button. There's a small whisk inside that spins as the milk warms up. It creates an excellent foam that nicely complements coffee or espresso.

The one downside is the price of the pods. If you're used to picking up 100 coffee pods from Costco for $40 prepare for a little sticker shock. Each pod costs roughly a dollar and a little change. But honestly, the coffee is so good it's the kind of thing you make once a day as a treat and then use your regular brewer for the rest of your coffee needs.

One last note. I really appreciate the small foot print this coffee maker leaves on a counter. I've had Kuerigs for years and they are pretty large. This is a slim and sexy machine that would look good in anyone's kitchen."

It was so easy to set up and I had a perfectly hot cup of coffee within a minute of plugging it in. I like how you can move the water container around the machine to suit your space. Having said that, I do think the size is a little cumbersome, and that is probably because of the water tank. Even when moved to either side or the back, it is still kind of bulky for my kitchen (I don't have a ton of counter space). Note: After refilling the water tank, simply set it on the base where it rests. Do not twist it after setting it down. My husband set it down on the base and twisted it, and water leaked. Just FYI. It didn't happen again after the twisting incident. This coffee maker is the pinnacle of coffee makers. I tried all of the pods provided and re-ordered the hazelnut pods as I like those best.

As much as I love the Nespresso machine, I LOVE the Aeroccino. It is amazing. Makes perfect foamed milk at the perfect temperature in about a minute. And it's so quiet! I confess I've been more into green tea matcha lattes lately, and use this aeroccino every day. It is so cool. I also love how small and compact it is, and it's pretty easy to clean. This has gotten much more use than the Nespresso but I guess I'm more of a matcha drinker lately :) All around this is a beautiful, superbly featured set and I would recommend it to all coffee lovers."

One touch loading of the pods, a nice and automatic emptying of the pods into a separate container. Easy fill and load on the water.

Best of all, the coffee is excellent. Rich and flavorful, much more so than the sad cups spat out by the average Keurig.

The only downside? The pods aren't cheap (in and around a buck a cup). Cheaper than Starbucks, but not by much. But good coffee, quick and easy.

Edit: Our office has continued to have a problem of water leakage when loading and removing the water canister. No matter how careful we are it seems to put a quarter cup of water on the counter every time. Not a tragedy by any extent, but something that would drive me much more insane in my own home."

Did they fix the massive wastefulness to the environment and use recyclable materials or sustainable materials? No.

Did they make a coffee machine that provides a superior value to their customers with this latest iteration? No.

They created a machine that drives profits by making it impossible to use pods manufactured by other companies. Each pod is more than a dollar.

Here’s my middle finger back to you nespresso. These kind of business decisions that worsen your customer experience will be your eventual ruin."
1786,5.0,2020-11-23,기계 전용, 레드,"My husband and I are avid coffee drinkers (aka we are coffee snobs) and wanted a single serve espresso maker that did not take up the entire counter. We live in a state that makes fresh roasted beans and feel that the baristas at most coffee houses burn the espresso or serve stale coffee… we never understood and still do not understand why people actively stand in long lines and pay $5.00 to $8.00 for crap coffee. We also do not have a whole lot of time in the morning to make a proper French press, etc. before work. For this reason, Nespresso works wonderfully.

PROS: The crema that this maker leaves is wonderful. (Tasty, rich and thick.), the coffee tastes fresh and crisp, Easy to use (a couple of slight pushes and bam! – you have coffee or an espresso in a minute), time-saver, easy to clean (each pod slides into a single compartment and you dispose all of them at once), size, speed, a versatile selection of pods, super quiet and doesn’t wake the kids in the morning, assembly (open up super cute well-packed box, gently clean things down, add water to compartment- you will have coffee in 5). Machine comes with a variety of pods to try. CONS: The pods are expensive (but only if you compare it to a Keurig), but still cheaper than if we ran to the corner coffeehouse. Average cost of pod ($1.10 per pod) versus Average cost of coffee or Doppio at coffee house ($2.00). You will not be able to find the pods just anywhere... You will have to go to a specialty store or order online."

The machine features a container on the back into which the empty coffee pod is emptied - wonderful idea. The frother is a really great bonus although it's a machine unto itself and has to be plugged into an outlet, so if you're limited in that regard, it could be a problem. This comes with a sample pack for both the frother and coffee maker, from decaffeinated to flavored coffees, which allows the consumer to try different ones. It's a bit pricey and you have to buy the pods (you can make them yourself using a product here at Amazon), but all in all, this is a lovely machine, very showy and attractive."

For whatever reason this new machine’s coffee temperature is not as hot as it should be, especially if you add any milk or cream. I called Nespresso to see if there is any factory settings that can be adjusted, but was told that the only thing I can do is to heat my cup up first, or heat my milk before adding it to the coffee.

This empty pod can be placed in the machine & hot water will be dispensed when the button in depressed. You may want to remove the container that receives the used pods, so you can save the empty pod for the future.

Of course, I don't buy expensive take out coffee, so I can see the difference of opinions in the costs of the cup of coffee. I can make a whole pot of fresh coffee with my other coffee maker for less than that.

Then I traveled overseas and had black coffee at a café where the beans are picked right out back. Holy cow, I was introduced to what real coffee is supposed to be like. Ever since I have been looking for the same experience. I now know that you have to make investments in order to know what you are getting. Good coffee will cost more than the average. Furthermore, the next step is processing what you get to make sure you get the most out of it. I'm no expert in anything coffee, other than liking a certain taste. I don't know how these machines work. I just know the Nespresso by De'Longhi works and works well. An easy process to get your coffee made. The only downside of course is the cost of the pods. So very nice that you can get 5 brew sizes. Doubly nice you can move the water tank around to fit counter spacing."

I use to go to Starbucks nearly daily to get a double shot espresso black over ice for $8!!!

Now that I have this machine I'm addicted to the Double Shot Espresso Scuro its $1 a pod.
It tastes like a chocolate vanilla and I can drink a double shot a day every day of the week for $7 as opposed to Starbucks were I'd spend about $56.

My favorite coffee flavor is Mexico.

And my favorite limited edition flavors are -
Pumpkin spice cake, Italia Black espresso, Australian white over ice.

The limited edition flavors are available online and in store... I don't have a store near me in 50 miles so.... I order on the nespresso site and they give me free samples of coffee I never had before too!

I own this machine for 3 years and no issues.
And I own the Delonghi Evoluo for 2 years and then I have a classic nespresso maker as well but I like the taste of the vertuo better.

Then all of the sudden I noticed my coffee cups were not getting filled up like they used to and noticed puddling around my coffee maker. I ran the descaling process with the solution twice. I used a toothbrush to clean it all out including working the seals as best I could. Nothing worked. I was so happy with it at first but the machine is garbage and as any owner who has had one for a while can tell you it is only a matter of time before it starts leaking again even if you can get the problem fixed. Poor engineering. DO NOT BUY!

I do wish there were some more flavors in the expresso's but I'm happy with what I have found. I really like how it makes iced expresso and does not melt the ice too fast. Easy to clean but descaling is a bit of a chore and needs to be done. We had an issue, after a year, with coffee coming out the back. Called Nespresso and they were so nice and helpful.

It was like nothing I had ever had before in a coffee shop and thought it would be awesome to have my own machine, despite its exorbitant price. I finally own one, but I use it as my ""special treat"" coffee, not my everyday coffee. The machine is easy to set up and use. It produces a frothy coffee without milk or cream, which offers a unique spin on the hot beverage. If you want, though, you easily make and add milk froth to the coffee, too, giving it even more airiness and flavor. Where Nespresso gets you is that you have to buy their ""Nespresso capsules,"" which are like Keurig's K-cups, but not exactly. This coffee/espresso maker comes with a sample pack, but you can buy more capsules from Nespresso's website and get a deal if you buy in bulk. That's why this isn't my everyday coffee; I drink about 3 cups every morning and would go through the capsules like crazy.

For the design, I'd knock off half a star in my rating. The machine itself is plastic, which seems a little cheap for the price, and the water tank hooked on the back makes it look and feel like an afterthought. I would have liked a machine that looked a bit nicer sitting on my counter."

Notes
- Makes your drink quickly in under a minute
- Decent size reservoir we fill ours every few days
- Our favorite drinks are the caramel and the Giorno. These are much stronger than anything we can make with our Keurig.
- On a per drink basis, it really isn't too expensive. They are about a buck per drink if you buy the pods on Amazon
- Upcoming is pretty minimal - but we find that it tastes best with filtered water
- We use the frother on occasion and it works well

Final Verdict - a great option for anyone who enjoys gourmet coffees!"

Brought it home and tried out the samples. Wow, I now feel I’m being served by a barista. Crema was beautiful and lots of flavour.

Fast forward to today, yes I tried what everyone is talking about. I reused one of the Melozio Nespresso pods and filled it with my LavAzza and replaced the top with Reynolds wrap foil. Just make sure not to cover the bar code. Coffee came out perfect with lots of crema. Pics here are of my LavAzza reusing Nespresso pod. You can enjoy the best of both worlds.

1804,5.0,2022-07-29,기계 전용, 블랙,"I already own a Nespresso ""standard"" VertuoPlus coffeemaker, which has gotten passed down to one of my sons. This ""deluxe"" edition is identical to the twenty dollar cheaper regular edition except for: 1) the water tank is larger and 2) the cup stand and a few other parts of the machine are chromed metal instead of plastic.

If you've never had Nespresso coffee, you are in for a treat. Most coffee makers use some variation of pouring hot water over coffee grounds. The Nespresso utilizes a new way of making coffee by putting the coffee in a miniature centrifuge to force hot water through the coffee under pressure. The result is a rich coffee with a flavorful crema that is the equal or better to any espresso you've ever tasted. It is super easy to use and quiet and actually is smaller than my Keurig. There is one significant drawback: the pods are only sold by Nespresso, are limited in availability, and cost two to three times more per serving than Keurig. However, if coffee is your passion, then I think you will agree the Nespresso is worth the extra cost."

I brought it to work at my new job because my French boss uses a Nespresso in the office and I thought maybe we could use another. We have a  Starbucks Verismo 580 Brewer Silver (011023256)  at home and I didn't think we would want to switch but I didn't realize that this Nespresso VertuoPlus uses a different, larger pod than a conventional ""classic"" Nespresso. I've already ordered an additional 180 pods for this machine. I think it makes better coffee than Verismo and of course it's better than a Keurig.

The machine reads a bar code on each capsule and can be ""taught"" to make the same size cup given a specific sized pod. This is a really great feature as a frustration I have with the Starbucks Verismo is that I have to press additional buttons to incrementally fill my cup (I know this sounds ridiculous but when you are trying to make a cup of coffee while running around getting ready for work its annoying to have to keep returning to the machine to add more coffee to your cup).

It makes a very frothy cup of coffee."

1814,3.0,2018-04-04,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"My first modern non-traditional coffee maker. Generally works fine. I'm not a heavy drinker. They say the coffee is better than with other systems, I don't know... many people think so. I usually add vanilla flavoring to my coffee anyway. The Vanizio on its own wasn't enough for me.
Coffee will cost more than other systems that accept third party coffees, unless you re-use the coffee packets with the bar codes, which you can get supplies for, but kind of a hassle if you want a quick fix.

My biggest complaints with this model:
1) The cup support/holder/platform is too small in my opinion. Some may not care, but I don't like the base of my cup sticking out over the edge of the support. Sure it's works out ok, but it still bothers me.
2) The coffee dispenser is too close to the lip of the cup. It hasn't been an issue yet, but I just don't like the design. You might expect a liquid dispenser of any drink system to allow more room for the liquid to come out closer to the center of the cup.

I can't speak to to how the design compares with the other coffee systems, this was just supposed to be the latest Nespresso design so I went with it. Could have been a little better despite the benefits mentioned elsewhere (hotter than older systems, etc.)."

It makes good coffee, easy to use, fast brewing, relatively compact. But the pods are too expensive. I roughly went through 500 pods this year and average down they cost well over $1 per coffee, there are cheap ones like 85 cents, but the choices are limited and you have to buy 50 pods per time.

So this one year I spent $169 + $550 = $719. I bought a Breville 870 for my father last year, which was $500, and he probably only spent $100 on beans for the past year, not to mention he also has way more choices and can also make milk foam with it. If we keep using it, the difference down the road will be even larger. It makes no sense for me to keep paying more but getting less. The regular Nespresso or K-cup saw significantly price drop since it came out, and also has a huge selection of coffee now, but Vertuoline would probably never see this day coming, as the price had only went up and some of the coffee is almost never available."

I find Nespresso's service and care wanting even as I love their products and coffee pods and was one of first user of Nespresso in my region. I purchased a new VertuoPlus machine last December and tried it out the moment it was delivered. For some reason the machine could not make more coffee after the first pod and even that was defective compared to the samples I had at the store. Not seeing much information in the box on how to return I bought the defective machine back to the store in Macy's. I was told they do not take returns only the Nespresso Club but by then I was going into surgery the next day and could do little. A few weeks later I finally could call Nespresso Club. The rep was very nice said she will email me a return certificate and that I will also be getting a shipping label from UPS. This label never arrived. I called again and this time a rep from 718 area code answered, she could not hold back her contempt when we said we wanted to return the machine. When she instructed us to put the machine out from 8 am to 7 pm every day for the next three days we asked if there was any alternative as we are concerned about porch thieves. She shot back asking if we live in a very high crime neighborhood, and that is just one instant of her many smart lines. Then she told us (between numerous sighs) to write down every word on the instructions she was to give us because we tend to be"" very confused"" in other words having senior moments. For three days I stayed home watching over the machine, no pick up. We felt we had run out of options and I was ready to wait out the weekend and then bring it to UPS store on Monday which by then was about 3 weeks from the time we connected with Nespresso Club. Thankfully on Monday UPS came knocking on the door, had a label and picked up the machine FINALLY! This return took over our lives at a time when I was weak and limited in my movement and should have been spending my time and energy on recovery and rehab instead of fending with a passive/aggressive rep from 718 NYC and all these misinformed instructions.

So I cut into the machine to see what was the issue.. and the mains were frying the spade connector due to a fault somewhere. There was NO breaker or fuse. I have no idea how this machine got UL listed with the amps it pulls when heating, and the shitty design for the main power supply. Fault - to - Fire and bad DeLonghi customer service? No thanks.

1840,5.0,2017-12-09,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"This Nespresso Coffee and Espresso maker is great for coffee lovers. It uses its own pods and the machine can be adjusted to make either regular coffee or espresso. The quality of the coffee, using their pods, is excellent."
1841,3.0,2020-02-27,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"Good: Simple to use. Starts up fast. No need to wait for preheat to press ""brew""... if you press the top button a second time it starts the brewing/pouring as soon as the heat-up period is finished. Decent coffee with some pods. Machine stops at the amount of coffee suitable for each pod, and it is easy to stop early, i.e., get less volume than the intended amount.
Not so good: The ""crema"" is more of a foam on the top of the coffee/espresso. Gets annoying because it doesn't eventually break down. Nespresso over-engineered its pods to create a long lasting thick foam. Many of the coffee offerings are quite weak; we can strengthen them but cutting back the quantities made. But the espresso simply isn't like a good high pressure / pulled espresso.
Bad: Nothing. It is a very nice machine if you like their coffees and can tolerate the ""crema"" foam."

Keeps getting better, went to ship the thing back to NJ, and found return shipping will cost $40 USPS ground. lol. Can't really say shipping a $150 item back for warranty repair is cost effective. Especially given the product is only 6 months old and the damage looks to be from the factory.

After contacting DeLonghi I am told they no longer service the machine (only six months old). I must contact NespressoClub for service. NespressoClub tells me I must join their ""club"" in order to receive warranty service.

Still fuming over this, and after reading many reviews for issues with the machine having other issues with leaks, shutdowns and other odd problems that the ""club"" wants you to buy specialized products for (descaling), not even sure I want to send it in for servicing. Might count my losses (I still have two boxes of coffee pods) and give the pods to someone else.

ps: Joining their club means allowing them to install a ""special app"" to my browser to allow them to track my coffee and other purchases. Seriously? Who in their right mind installs software that is designed to track their web habits and agrees to this open invasion of privacy? Besides Facebook users, that is.

In any case, I asked for and received a shipping address to return the unit for warranty repair. I am told it will take 14 days minimum for the service - and that shipping delays might be incurred. Basically, once I get the machine in the mail, it will be at least 3 to 4 weeks before I can get it back to use it again.

Well, so much for brand (DeLonghi failed me big time) and so much for buying something that seemed to be fair quality from a reputable source (Amazon and Nespresso both failed in this).

What was that old saying? Caveat Emptor.
First impression was the lid never opened and closed properly. Always takes two attempts to open. I got used to that quirk and continued using it almost daily (often two or more cups).

Now, after six months, the thing is leaking like a sieve. The o-ring in the top is breaking down and chipping away (poorly made rubber does this). So for every cup I make - a portion of coffee is left dribbling out the back of the machine in a large puddle.

I'm going to see what DeLonghi will do - the thing should have at least a year warranty. Hopefully they can just send a new o-ring/seal whatever it's called."

We drink 4 cups a day at my house, so our habit is $120 a month, $1440 a year. We've had it for over 2 years now, so we've spent over $3,000 on the pods. I guess it is cheaper than Starbucks, but Starbucks is too expensive for my taste."

Not only is it narrower and takes up a bit less space, but it's not as loud, either, and is easier to take apart for cleaning etc. The quality of the coffee it makes is about the same as the older model, which was good enough for a pod machine.

However, my problem with this pod coffee maker is the same as with the older model - Nespresso's pods are specific to their brand, pricey, and not easy to find (especially if you want a variety of coffee types). If this took the same type of pods as the readily available Keurig-style pods, I would rate it four stars...but it doesn't, so three stars it is."

Guess this one is going in the trash pile :-(."
1865,2.0,2018-01-25,기계 전용, 블랙,"For about $1.50, you get almost 2 teaspoons of coffee. That means you are paying over $20 per lb. for your coffee. Yes, you are paying less than you would for a professionally made latte but when you are out and about and you want a coffee, you also pay for the experience and convenience. However, when you are at home, do you expect to pay ultra premium prices for something you have to make yourself? A pound of Starbucks Espresso roast to brew at home is roughly half the price of the Nespresso capsules. Even Starbucks who overcharges for their coffee knows that making it at home should be less expensive than having something made for you. Nespresso sells you on the fact that it's less than buying something that is professionally made so you don't notice that you are paying $20 a lb. for coffee and then you have to prepare your own milk and add your own flavoring (if desired) in order to get something that is roughly the same as the professionally made version. To top it off, you are locked into $20+ a lb coffee because they don't want any competition and they add DRM to the pods. If they believed in their product, they could just sell it at a fair price but one major reason for DRM is so they don't have to be good, they just have to get you to buy. Once you are in, you are locked in. They made it easy to use, the espresso and coffee are good but they make it virtually impossible to get the pods and they charge ultra premium prices for something that you can get for less than 1/4 the cost if you get a grind your own espresso machine. It might be a little different if you could pick up some coffee locally but all of the advertised ""convenience"" is thrown out the window because you have to order the pods and wait for them to arrive... unless you want to pay even more... smh."

1870,5.0,2020-06-22,기계 전용, 레드,"If you've never had coffee from a Nespresso Vertuo machine, you owe it to yourself to try it out. It is a whole level beyond Keurig-type brewing.

Most coffee makers use some variation of pouring hot water over coffee grounds, from standard drip machines to the convenience of Keurig machines. The first generation Nespresso machine used the traditional Espresso technique of pressurized water forced through the coffee grounds. While this produces superior coffee, it also is loud because of the pressurized pump required, and is also prone to mechanical failure. The new generation Vertuo machines use a entirely new way of making coffee by putting the coffee pod in a miniature centrifuge and using that pressure to drive the hot water through the coffee instead of using hydraulic pressure. The result is fantastic-- a rich coffee with an amazing crema that is the equal or better to any you've ever tasted.

The pros: it gives a rich brewed crema to both espresso and regular coffee blends. It is super easy to use and quiet and actually is smaller than my Keurig. It gives coffee that is the equal or better to Starbucks, especially if you use a separate frother when you blend in milk or cream.
The cons: EXPENSE. The pods are only sold by Nespresso, are limited in availability, and cost over a buck a piece. That's why I would really recommend to try before you buy if you can--- if you truly love great coffee or if you want to cut back on your Starbucks habit but can't face just ordinary drip coffee, this Nespresso could be your new best friend."

For starters, I have been hooked on the Nespresso brand, they make amazing coffee, but the Delonghi brand just doesn't hold up. My first Delonghi machine broke within the one year time frame, apparently the diagnosis was that the motor burned out. Nespresso was nice enough to warranty it in exemplary fashion. They even shipped a box to my house to send it back to them in and I had the same(but brand new) replacement machine sent almost immediately back to me. Problem is, my second Delonghi machine broke in just shy of two years, which is outside of the warranty window of 1 year. So, in a nuthshell, I have had a nespresso machine for just shy of 3 years now and I am entering in to needing a third machine. This is ridiculous. I know if many inexpensive coffee machines owned by friends and they never have any problems and the machines last years and years. Delonghi is a total piece of shi$ and I wouldn't waste even $10 on this brand of machine. Do yourself a favor and buy a Nespresso by Breville which friends of mine have had for 7 and 10 years, they are still rocking great coffee. If you don't listen to my advice, you will be purchasing a replacement within the next 2 years because the machine won't last. I guarantee it.

3. The very sweet, helpful & nice lady Sashana will help you through a testing of the machine. My machine failed the process and leaked much worse. She then instructs you on how to send back the machine.

3.a. Nespresso will send you a shipping box, return label with instructions.

4. I got lucky having registered my machine, it is still under warrantee.

5. Ask for a gift for the trouble. They are sending me a free sleeve. Hoping they cover shipping.

1880,1.0,2020-05-02,기계 전용, 그레이,"The one-touch feature and excellent coffee of this DeLonghi VertuoPlus Titan machine sold me on the spot during a demo in a local kitchen store. That was early July 2018, five months later in December 2018, we noticed coffee puddling around the rotor well where the capsule is placed. By January 2019 the amount of leaked coffee had progressed to the point where I called Nespresso and after some discussions about ""run a cleaning cycle and then call us back"" I convinced them that was not the problem and they issued a repair (UPS shipping) to correct the problem. That went quick and easy in less than a week and the repair paperwork indicated them replacing the ""Top Rotor"". Note that on an average day we make two cups of coffee and on the weekend about four or six each day. I did use the cleaning cycle and descaled every four months. So now eight months after the repair we suddenly have lots of coffee puddling around the capsule well and so much that it's running out the back of the machine and onto the counter. Of course, it's out of warranty and therefore it's junk and I need to advise prospective buyers that this unit, made with all plastic, will fail! DeLonghi did not perform very well on this design-- there are many other reports of this problem on the Internet.

Now after Christmas, I go to use the Evoluo and it LEAKS EVERYWHERE. I called to troubleshoot and it was a machine issue not a water tank issue so they gave me the option of sending it back for repairs. I've read reviews about people sending it back for repairs and it doesn't get fixed so I'm not doing that. So I ask for a return and refund, BUT because ""I opened it and used it"" (once, I may add, before finding out it was completely faulty), I have to pay for this giant heavy box to be returned to them – they won't even send a return label. I also asked if I could just return it now for the machine I ordered in the first place, but nope because I said I'd just keep it before finding out it didn't work I can't do either. So as a first time customer – I strongly don't recommend. I ordered because I've had their coffee before and I loved it, but clearly didn't know their customer service and machine quality are terrible.

Save your money, buy something that is more durable or that has better customer service."
1896,2.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,"I got this last year for Christmas. It worked beautifully for a while. Fast forward to June of this year and I notice some espresso puddles starting to appear. I clean it thinking it was a one time thing. Nope. It started getting worse. Followed all the proper maintenance instructions, descaling, etc. Called Nespresso, who walked me through troubleshooting the leak. It didn’t work. Still leaking. According to the reviews on the Nespresso website, this particular model has a history or leaking. As of now my machine is being “repaired” by Nespresso. It takes 3-5 weeks. Which also happens right around the same time the warranty expires. Fingers crossed it gets fixed but I don’t have my hopes set very high."

2 out of 5 star
In less than 1 year the VertuPlus begins to leak where the coffee is extracted from the capsule, read the online forum and it appears to be a known manufacture issue. Nepresso sells on convenience and quality, but now I'm frustrated after buying this expensive vertuo plus delux machine AND ordering monthly capsules from the Nespresso website. Did they purposely design a machine to break down this easily? horrible experience, called customer service to get a shipping label for maintenance and repair. 2 stars given, 1 for the lousy machine, 1 star for customer service with the hope nespresso will repair or replace this broken machine.

old review
1 out of 5 star
had this vertuoplus deluxe for a few months and it continues to malfunction and waste coffee capsules by pulling a short shot instead of a full cup. ran the cleaning cycle several times and searched online for answers. If Nespresso makes a crap product this is a disservice, simply outrageous to spend lots of money on a machine and capsules without it working consistently."
1898,2.0,2022-03-31,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I was so excited to receive this. I decided to splurge when my coffee pot went out. 1.) you HAVE TO USE THEIR CAPSULES. And they are much pricier than I expected. 2.) This machine is LOUD!!!! it sounds like a rocket shipping off to space every time I brew a cup of coffee. Not so great when I want to enjoy a cup of coffee before the rest of the house wakes up. 3.) sometimes it doesn’t work right. You put a capsule in and press the button and nothing happens. Have to reopen it and start again, but because when you open it the capsules slides back to the empty tray even though you weren’t able to use it. You have to fish the capsule out and wipe out the coffee that spilled out because it already punctured the capsule. This happens every other morning so it gets pretty annoying. Knowing what I know now, I would have bought a keurig and saved myself some money."

So embarrassing"
1900,1.0,2021-02-23,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I can’t recommend this item. It worked OK for a while, I didn’t use it that often, but then it began leaking large amounts of brewed coffee with each cup I would make. I got the impression from Nespresso support it may be a “problem“ machine. I would not order it again. I’m gonna try the Evoluo model now, Nespresso is going to give me a substantial discount on it so I’m hoping that works better than this one."
1901,2.0,2018-01-06,기계 전용, 그레이,"This machine works great with the espresso pods, but anything designated as ""coffee"" ends up being kind of thin and watery tasting. I really expected more out these pods considering that cost around $1 each. I can use 4 of the small pods to make a really good tasting cup of strong coffee, but that costs like $4. Might as well go to Starbucks or Tim Horton's. After a year of use, I'm going to be retiring the machine and moving on to a different brewing method that makes stronger tasting coffee."
1902,2.0,2020-05-11,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"Threw it away today, with it only lasting a little over a year. Water started leaking out of the bottom and it just flashes red now. I let it sit for another few months while I debated whether to go back to Keurig, which I will even though I still have $50 worth of Nespresso pods. I would not recommend buying a Nespresso as this seems to be pretty common. An office I visited even had two for when one inevitably broke."
1903,2.0,2020-07-18,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I have used this product gently, to make about one cup of coffee each day, since I bought it last year (less than 13 months ago), and all of a sudden it is broken and leaking coffee all over. There was nothing to cause it to break and it was not being over-used. The coffee is delicious, definitely my favorite of the pod-model machines on the market, but I can't spend this kind of money on a product that breaks so quickly."
1904,1.0,2019-12-09,기계 전용, 그레이,After being in Europe summer of 2019 I came back wanting my own machine! I received this machine for Christmas 2019. It has not even been a year of use and this machine began leaking yesterday! I got online and read up on it! I ran a cleaning cycle and then I used a toothpick to clean the coffee granules from the seal. It still leaks! Highly dangerous Nestle with this being a product that has to be plugged into electricity! I am terrified to use it now in case I catch something on fire! This has been an issue for plenty of Vertuo Buyers! BEWARE! I would have NEVER asked for this had I known about this issue! Excitement got the best of me. I do not want a repaired machine either after reading reviews!
1905,1.0,2021-02-03,기계 전용, 그레이,"Similar to the review right below mine, my machine has entered perpetual “need to descale” mode and is not working after my first descaling process. They have made the process so convoluted so at first I thought it was doing it incorrectly....however, after checking with independent posts on the internet as far as instructions I was doing it right, but the machine is just messed up.

A sign that this might be a problem is that if you purchase the descaling solution from Nespresso, it does not come with instructions with it and they refer you to the website because you have to watch a video in order to see the instructions.

I will maybe try a different Nespresso machine manufacturer when I toss this one because I think maybe Nespresso should just stick to making the coffee and outsource their machine product to someone who knows how to make appliances."
1906,1.0,2020-10-31,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I would give this product 5 stars if it hadn't started leaking at the top where the coffee pad is leading to coffee running out the back end and creating a nice mess. For about 18 months, loved this machine. Great tasting coffee and easy to use. Now, unless you stand there with a rag to mop up the coffee as it leaks during a coffee making, you're going to have a big mess to clean up with every cup. Lots of complaints about this on Amazon, YouTube, etc., so obviously a known problem that Nespresso has not deemed worthy of fixing. Too bad, they're losing a lot of money on coffee I'm now back to brewing in my Norelco coffee maker."
1907,2.0,2017-12-01,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I used this product at school successfully for most of last school year, but after I returned back to school this year after summer break and went through the descaling and other cleaning procedures specified by the machine, the machine now leaks from the capsule canister as well as the nest-area where the capsules are brewed. This is ridiculous and unacceptable quality for such an expensive product. Very disappointed."
1908,1.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,"Original review: The machine is fine overall and makes a fine cup of espresso. However, about 1 in 5 times the unit will not process one of the pods. I have to manually reinsert a few times to get it to work. Very frustrating.

JUST DOWNGRADED to one star. 9 times out of 10 the unit does not work. You have to eject the pod, reinsert several times, and eventually it will work. This makes a mess and you get grounds in the coffee. A real downer because my wife loves the coffee when the machine functions."
1909,2.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 타이탄.,"I loved this machine while it lasted! Then it started leaking: a puddle of coffee underneath it every time we brew. Worst part - we've had this thing for just about 8 months! Of course the Amazon return window had passed, so I called Nespresso who wants me to send the machine in for repair. What a pain!! Your product is defective, just send me a new machine! In my opinion, this is not adequate customer support."
1910,1.0,2018-01-20,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I had no idea this was a pod system, so after trying all the different variety packs, the good ones were tiny size. I wasted money on a bunch of 'large cups' and they weren't very large at all. I drink a lot of coffee. Machine is also very slow. No filter options...no reusable pods. Kept buying more and hoping it would be better. Wasn't. I still have mine sitting here, as I bought a keurig and like much much better. $30 for keurig gets you 72 pods. $33 for 30 for Nespresso, tiny, cruddy cups. You might as well buy starbucks/dunkin every day tbh. Just as expensive.

Just hoping I can sell mine even for a little. Do this at risk. Was not worth it. There are better options."
1911,1.0,2021-08-11,기계 전용, 블랙,"I bought this machine directly from Nespresso, but I wanted to leave a review here as a warning. This is the second time I’m sending this machine back for repairs and I just purchased it November 2020. I’ve only had it for 3 1/2 months! The brew button just stops working and is really touchy...maybe I got a dud who knows. I love the machine when it works, makes a great cup of coffee, but not worth the hassle when you have to return it once a month to be repaired. I would probably purchase the older machine if I had a do-over."
1912,1.0,2017-12-17,기계 전용, 그레이,"I used the machine only one time a day for a year - called the hotline (b/c online they say the warranty is 2 years on all Nespresso machines) and was told I could send it in for $125 to be fixed. Well, a new machine costs less than that. Went back to my Keurig which tastes half as good but is still going strong 10 years after purchase.... bad customer service at best. Even stranger that they had the nerve to offer a fix for less than the machine is worth brand new. All around disappointed."
1913,2.0,2017-08-25,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"We purchased this through Sur La Table and are on our second machine in two weeks. The canister leaks terribly, like a puddle of water under the machine at all times. This has been so frustrating, as each time we’ve called the Nespresso club, the hold time is over 20 mins. I’ve resorted to emailing them, hoping for a fix. We’ll be taking this back(again) if they cannot provide one.
Still makes good coffee, but unfortunately has a major design flaw."
1914,1.0,2020-03-31,기계 전용, 그레이,"I received the machine as a Christmas present and we tried to get it working. It started leaking immediately and nothing we tried would stop the leaking. I called the company to find out how to return the machine and was told I had to pay to return it. This is a defective item!!! I should not have to pay to return an item that is defective, that floods my counter every time I use it. When I asked to speak with a manager I was told they would get back to me in 24-48 hours. All of this was ""in policy"" The customer service agent just kept repeating ""I understand"" like he was reading from a script. It was the most useless conversation. If you currently have a Keurig, I suggest you stick with it. It won't flood your counters with water and customer service is pretty good."

I called customer service and 15 minutes later, I have to hang up, wait 15 minutes and call back so they can do more troubleshooting with the machine cold. The coffee is quite pricey, I expected better from the machine. Wish I could just get a refund and purchase a different brand. I have $200+ in coffee pods that I can't use."

Knew it was capable of using the new Nespresso Vertuo capsules but it was very unclear on Amazon that it was not compatible with the original Nespresso capsules.

1922,1.0,2018-12-27,기계 전용, 그레이,"These are made to make great coffee. They are not made to last. I cleaned mine regularly and right after they are out of warranty, they stop. The manufacturer offers to fix or sell you another machine. I can buy a machine on Amazon cheaper than any offer the maker makes. I will miss the coffee, but buying a new machine every year is not something I am willing to do. Goodbye Nespresso!"
1923,1.0,2019-10-31,기계 전용, 그레이,"All I can say is don’t buy it! Coffee doesn’t stay hot. Each different type of coffee pod brews differently. Example coffee strength, froth and heat! Our cups of coffee where never hot enough. You expect your coffee to be hot and stay hot for more than a couple of minutes. Then you have to buy the de scaling product from them only. Then what an absolute nightmare doing the de scaling process. Our machine broke down and sent it to the manufacturer to repair it. 6 months later broke down again. Now out of 1 year warranty no recourse. They only offer 2 to 3 types of decaf pods very limited! Stay away buy something else."

You will receive no support from the manufacturer and amazon will only offer a partial refund if you send it back (cost alone of packing, etc.), not worth it.

It's as if the pod isn't being pushed down far enough and when it sound up to 7,000 rpm, it's sending all that extra coffee out the back to the used pod container and subsequently the counter.

1953,5.0,2021-04-16,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"Overall I really like this machine. While there are some minor quirks about owning a machine like this, I find myself enjoying it and the convenience is great, especially for having coffee one cup at a time.

Packaging:
The packaging is fantastic quality both in appearance and for product protection. Colors on the printing were great and definitely works well if giving this as a gift.

Machine Appearance:
The look of this is machine is fantastic. Most of the unit is a shiny 'piano black', along with some matte black and metallic plastic buttons. Any metal parts have a nice bright shine to it. The water reservoir is robust and clear to see water levels. The machine takes up a little more counterspace than my old coffee maker. Overall it has my approval on looks and build quality.

Machine Setup:
Setup of the unit is easy. Be sure to read thru the quickstart manual to ensure the machine 'self-cleans' prior to initial use. Adding water is as simple as removing the reservoir, filling it with water, and putting it back in the machine.
Controls are simple. Click the handle up and the machine opens. Put pod in, click the handle down, and it closes. Hit the button on the top of the machine and it warms up the water and then dispenses your coffee or espresso.
The machine does not take much time to get the water hot. I was actually surprised that after a minute or two it begins pouring the coffee and that the water 'warm up time' was not longer than it was.

There is adjustment for the amount of water per pod type also. The controls for water adjustment are a little difficult as you need to hold down buttons while actually making coffee. It is explained in detail how to accomplish this. The nice thing is that if you ever feel the need to adjust the amount of water dispensed thru a specific type of pod, it will always remember how much water you prefer. Sadly there is no way to tell if you are on the 'default' or a 'custom' amount. It is great that it only adjusts the water for the specific pod you have in the machine. For example if you want a little bit stronger vanilla type and adjust the water quantity, it does not change the water amount in any other pods, only vanilla that you adjusted. The machine remembers and stores the information for each pod type.
To be honest, I have only tried changing these settings a few times to see how it worked, and then I realized that the machine and pods were pretty much set up properly in the first place. Nice though that you can fine tune it to your liking if required and that it only affects one flavor pod. Difficult as there is no way to tell what setting you are on.

Cleaning:
For the exterior of the machine and for any other areas, a damp towel works well. Not much cleaning is required for any surfaces other than a weekly wipedown during routine kitchen cleaning.

I love that the unit has its own 'wastebin' for the used pods. There is a rail system that will automatically lift the pods up and slides them into the wastebin. Wastebin is large enough to store 15-20 used pods and simple to wash if it ever becomes dirty. The bin is magnetic for easy removing, dumping, and putting back.

One thing to pay attention to, is that the machine requires a special solution that you need to run thru the machine for cleaning. This is to avoid mineral buildup, so be sure to be prepared for this type of cleaning when the machine tells you for this maintenance.

Pods/Coffee/Espresso packs:
The machine does come with a sampler of very colorful coffee and espresso pods that are available. While it did not include every flavor offered, there were plenty of different pods to sample to see which I liked. Pods are well constructed in that the foil and aluminum body is sufficient to protect the grounds. I have 'dented' the pods on purpose, and they still function properly within the machine.

Milk frother:
It does work very well for both cold and hot frothing. It utilizes a magnetic 'clutch' for the stirring device which allows for very easy cleaning. The most important thing that I have found is that the amount of milk really matters. Put in too much milk, and you will find yourself having much more milk than froth. However, as with any 'tool' you will need to learn how to use it properly. I have had the best luck with whole milk and surprising enough works well with goats milk.
This has been kind of a hit or miss personally since I typically just add milk directly to my espresso/coffee.
Having people over for a proper cup, you can bet that the milk frother is used.

Not many negatives to say, but there are some things to pay attention to.
1) From time to time, the espresso pods get stuck. If I make a cup of espresso, and do not make coffee again for a day or two, I have found that there is not enough weight for the pod to drop out into the rails and into the wastebin. It gets caught on the spikes that the hot water comes thru when the machine opens. I am aware of this issue, so whenever I have the machine open, I look for the old cup to drop and slide down the rails. If this does not happen, then I just use my finger or a wooden toothpick to get the pod to drop onto the removal rails. Careful as the spikes are sharp.
This is not typically an issue for the actual coffee pods as they are larger/heavier. Another thing that you can do, is immediately after having espresso, open the machine and close it again so the pod will not 'dry' out and stick.

2) While this makes a fantastic cup of coffee, you will be stuck at the pricepoint of the pods. I will leave you to compare the current pricing for the costs of pods. Currently, the cost is around double of other 'pod' systems, and 3-4 times the amount of 'generic' types. At the same time, this cost is also on par to that of fast food or gas stations (with Nespresso tasting far superior), and much less than the specialty coffee shops. So if you pay more than a dollar a cup at the coffee shop, this can be a cheaper and more convenient solution.

3) Coffee Flavor Choices. You will be limited to what is offered. The flavors that are offered are fantastic with an ample selection of flavors ranging from mild to robust, vanilla to caramel. Espresso you have four options. Decaf, you have one option. So perhaps with time, we will have more choices.

4) While it makes a fine cup of coffee and espresso, keep the following in mind. Proprietary cups means that you will not be brewing coffee with your own beans. This in turn means that you cannot get rid of your existing coffee machine on the counter.

Quick Summary:
Ability to make coffee: 10/10 - Makes a cup of coffee easily and without fuss
Packaging (looks/protection): 10/10 - Colors are great and care has gone into packaging
Ease of use: 8/10 - Simple to make coffee, little difficult to adjust settings (not that you really need to do this)
Value: 7/10 - Nice high end machine that looks great, cheaper than coffee shops, more expensive than other brands.

Overall satisfaction: 9/10.
I really like this machine and the coffee/espresso it makes.
I would like to see more flavors come out, and the ability to utilize my own coffee beans.
Would make a fantastic gift for anybody who enjoys coffee and espresso."
1954,1.0,2019-12-04,기계 전용, 그레이,"The machine is a reasonable price. The pods, however, are not. Nespresso charges $1.62 per pod now, which is very expensive. I no longer use my machine and switched back to regular bagged coffee. Much cheaper and more delicious"
1955,1.0,2021-02-04,기계 전용, 타이탄.,Had this Nespresso for only 6 months and all of a sudden it is spewing coffee out the back! What kind of design is this?? Picture attached.
1956,3.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I am giving this 3 stars and am feeling kind of badly about it. It may be my own issues with it, but I do indeed have a few complaints.

The water tank, which swings around in order to save space, doesn't really save space. It only moves so far to the side and it doesn't sit flush beside the machine. It drives me crazy because it looks like it should be moved forward a little and straightened out. When moved as far as it goes to the side towa rd d the front it still sits back further than the machine, so the tank and the machine could never sit flush against the wall/back splash for example. Perhaps my own pet peeve, but it does indeed irritate me that I can't straighten it out and it always looks crooked. You can of course swing it back behind the machine and then it sets nicely back in the corner of the counter, but that's not where I wanted to put it (my kitchenaid stand mixer sets in the corner).

The tray to sit your mug on. Oh boy. Maybe I need further advice on this or a different mug, or..? The tray is small. It also has a small lip going around the edge which essentially makes the space on the tray even smaller. I sat an average size mug on the tray and it *just* fits. Theres no room leftover inside between the lip and mug and you have to very deliberately set the mug on the tray to get it inside that lip, otherwise it will sit on top of it and be crooked/wobbly. Technically this isn't an issue, I guess, since the coffee/espresso will still go into the mug. You can move the tray up and down to accommodate for a taller or shorter mug, but there's no adjusting forward or backward. Also, the mug sits right against the machine, so you're really limited on the size of the mug you can use because of the position of the nozzle that puts out the coffee.. it will end up not going in the mug if you have an odd mug shape. For example, I have some where the center of the mug is fatter/wider than the rim of the mug and I can't use those with this machine because the coffee will shoot down half on the rim of the mug and half outside it closer to the machine. (Hope I am explaining this properly and not making it confusing). The size and positioning of the tray and the position of the nozzle should have been a little more thought out better. There needs to be a bigger tray, to accommodate more mug/cup sizes and shapes. The nozzle should then be placed above the center of the tray, that way you have room to set the mug where it needs to be and have the nozzle still at a position to fill with no problem. The other machine I've been using is set up that way and I can use any size or shape of mug, cup, thermos, etc. It works out very well and is a huge advantage over this VertuoPlus.

So, with that average mug size, (and really I think it is slightly smaller than average because it is sort of a decorative mug and the only one I had that fit properly in the tray), the coffee pods fill the mug to the very top. So, if you want to add creamer, milk, use the frother, etc, you cant because there's no room left in your mug. Now, if you dont usually add anything then I guess this is no problem, but in my house we all use creamers or milk and also use a frother (theres a frother arm on my other machine).

The frother. Hmm. It does a really good job, BUT... its a whole separate appliance which also needs to be plugged in. It has a heavy duty, 3 prong plug. I do not have outlets to spare as it is. I wasnt prepared for this to be plugged in separately and again that it my own personal issue. I didn't think it through thoroughly when looking at the product description before ordering, I guess. So yea, my issue. I do like the convenience of my other machine having the frother arm built in and it works just as good as this separate machine.

There is no ""drip stop"" type feature after you brew. Sometimes it can drip for a while and it irritates me because I want to let the mug sit there so there's no dipping into the tray which results in not needing to clean the tray daily... BUT I don't want to wait til it is done dripping... I want to drink my coffee! Maybe I am spoiled with my other machine and the drip stop?

The VertuoPlus does have some very neat features though and this is why I feel bad to go with the 3 stars. For one thing, I love how it spits the used pods into the pod container after you brew. I like the way the lid is motorized to open and close. Self cleaner feature is a plus, of course. And most of all, this is some really good coffee and espresso! Love the variety pack that it comes with so we could try different flavors and see what we like. Theyre not only yummy, but it's actually pretty. It looks like a box of Christmas balls when you open it, with all the pretty metallic colored pods. I had never tried this brand before, so yes I was impressed with the shiny, pretty colors :)

So, I will come back and add more as I use this longer, but for now these are my main thoughts on this machine. It does make a great beverage, but I feel like the machine itself could use a few improvements in aesthetics and tray size etc to be more accommodating. Also, I'm not loving the whole separate appliance frother, though it does a great job.

Also note that this set does not come with any of the mugs you see in the product pictures. It only comes with the variety pack of flavors. The mugs can be bought on the nespresso site. You can also download an app for recipes etc."

 I used this machine regularly, brewing no more than 1 cup of coffee a day. The Nespresso coffee would come out smooth and tasted amazing. I periodically cleaned the machine using factory settings and cleaning guidelines. However, 1 year to the date of purchase my machine started spewing coffee from the rear. A few ounces would pour from the rear and into the used pod basket. After some online investigation, I saw quite a few videos online with the same issue and within the same timeframe. There seems to be a consistency in machine malfunctions. It was good while it lasted. At this price point, I wish I got more than a year of usage."
1968,1.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 레드,Doesn't make a good cup of coffee or good espresso either.
1969,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,"So this is nespresso's newer line that uses the vertuoline of pods, which sorta sucks because you have to pay full price on nespresso pods. The original pods, and machines are actually good if you just drink espresso type drinks as they have generic pods, as well as starbuck and peets pods. But back to this machine, this new machine uses the an electronic activated lever in front, so you just pull up and it opens, you just tap on it down, and it closes, powered to open/close. Thats pretty cool, and this machine isn't as loud as some video's show, i was expecting like like crazy whirring noises, but it's only slightly louder then the original machine. The water container is like double the size too of my essenza mini but this one does full coffee cup and if you buy the larger pods can do small thermos and larger travel mug sizes. So far i tried the odacio coffee, it was ok, smooth but flavor wasn't my favorite. I tried the diavolitto expresso and that was excellent. In both i tried frothing Oatly (oat milk) with a half pack of sugar, in the aero3 frother, and it seemed to work fine, heating the oat milk to an acceptable temperature. For some reason it didn't do well with the silk brand oat milk though, never got hot enough. I have purchased the nespresso melozio as well and will try that soon, which is another coffee mug type size pod. The machine does come with a sampler pack which i haven't tried yet. But this machine does seem to output more espresso, compared to the original, and mainly i think because of the pod size, so if you don't like small espresso shots maybe this machine will work better for you. Just remember you will pay full price for pods though. It might be more cost effective to do double shots on the original machine. So with that said, this machine has all the features of the old machine, but does everything larger, you can adjust water output just like the old machine, but this one has more automated features like the auto close and open for pod insertion. It also reads the pods barcode to know how much water instead of selecting the right size button, this machine only has one on button. It has a clean mode, and reset mode as well. The water tank can be moved from left, middle or right side which is interesting. The cup holder can be moved per cup size or taken off for tall mugs/thermoses. I currently marked flavor on 4 stars as i thought the coffee setting wasn't as good, it's a strong smooth coffee, but wish the flavors were better. Will comment more when i taste the other coffee pods. So for overall competition against keurig i give it a 5, as the quality surpasses keurig by a mile, but i'd minus a star just because of the pods costing so much. I expect the coffees to taste just as good for the price we're paying per cup which is about 1.10 30 pods for 33 on amazon. So compared to SB, you're still getting a deal, but wish the pods were a little cheaper. If you're planning on making lattes, recommend getting the combo with the aerocinno3 frother, as it's about 50 bucks bundled with the coffee maker, it's 99 separate. The coffee machine has a 40% discount if you create an account, so it's still cheaper to get the bundle."
1970,2.0,2021-07-14,기계 전용, 레드,"I bought in sale. It was marked down nearly all year. Than amazon prime day, it went up 20$. Wtf! But back down after the thrill of prime day, I grabbed it. A good quick espresso. But espresso is not a fast and easy beverage to make. Don’t judge espresso by what you get at Starbucks. Capsule espresso, next they’ll be having microwave TV dinners. Lol. But people demand instant over quality. All n all a nice little “espresso” machine. But will only use special mfr pods with bar code rims. The way it reads how much water it uses. ???

Update . After time to use, and time to ponder this machine and need ton purchase Barcode only coffee Nespresso type pods , You can’t use any other pod but one with a barcode, Causing more trash in landfills, negating the ability to use a reusable pod. Though there is a standard reusable barcode pod for a specific amount of coffee. Make a set for different types. People are looking more towards recyclability, reuseable products now. Get with the program. This technology failed and should have stopped on the development end of production. Boo to delonghi for not considering this. If you have there would already be a variety of reuseable pod sizes.
This is one of those worthless novelty products that are just a waste of any money’s spent, even when on sale."

Amazon gift card for my birthday, and decided to take the plunge. This makes superb coffee and expresso! I purchased a replacement policy but I have had zero problems with it. I enjoy a good cuppa of both coffee and expresso and this machine delivers. Try experimenting with the different paks offered: so far my 2 favorites are Giornio and the Vanizio for coffee and the Voltesso for expresso. A lot of folks complained about the cost of the pods. For great taste, I will pay the price! Still cheaper than Starbucks. The machine is fast and convenient to use."
1972,5.0,2020-03-08,기계 전용, 그레이,"Obviously this makes a better cup than pot or Keurig coffee. But I think it rivals coffee from a legit espresso machine. My dad has a Saeco espresso machine that he spent close to $1,000 on and this little pod rivals it. I'm telling you this Nespresso machine does it right! I had my first cup at my boss' office when she kept telling me how great it was. When I saw the machine, I thought - yea, OK. I'm sure it's good but it looks like Keurig's baby cousin. I made a half calf and could not believe how good it was. Then I had a regular and I was convinced. It's so creamy and rich - like you'll find in Europe. All those George Clooney commercials are starting to make sense to me. I get it. I will never go back. The best part is they recycle their pods for free. So you can feel good about having 5 cups a day."

With Covid-19 putting a damper in our plans to roam around and hang out at the coffee shop like we used to. Now we look forward to playing some coffe shop music in our kitchen, brewing some amazing Nespresso favorites, sitting and chatting our mornings away together. I HIGHLY recommend this machine. We have yet to try the frother yet but i'm sure it'll only add to the awesome experience we've had so far. My ONLY complaint is that I wish this machine was able to take a universal capsule that we can fill our own favorite coffee with. This is really such a small desire being that we haven't found a Nespresso capsule were disappointed with."

The main thing I hate about coffee is the clean up, and this takes all the work out of it.

DeLonghi is the brand & Deluxe is the model. All models offer “conservation” but the Deluxe is smaller on countertop and a flick of a button is nice even for one who does not have arthritis.
2032,5.0,2018-12-27,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Exactly what I expected!
2033,5.0,2021-11-23,기계 전용, 그레이,My second Nespresso machine and works very well. It is not bulky and easy to operate. I recommend it.
2034,5.0,2022-09-03,기계 전용, 그레이,It was a gift for my son's birthday!! He said it made the best coffee !!
2035,5.0,2018-09-16,기계 전용, 그레이,"I absolutely love the coffees that this machine makes. The froth is incredible and the variety of tastes makes it a fun journey. However, it is now April and I bought the machine in November and there is a 1 in 3 chance my 7.75 oz brew will only give me a 2 oz. brew. I use bottled water and I have run the machine 3x in a row with vinegar and I still get wonky brews. I am going to contact the company and see what can be done.
UPDATE I called espresso support and they very patiently walked me through how to reset machine. We did that and it works great and now I know how to problem-solve down the road. TIPS Use filtered water then you only need to descale every 6 months. The machine will tell you when it is time to descale. Do not push down on the button with the coffee cup light or the lever that opens the pod placement for very long. Tap and release. Keeping your finger there or double tapping either will reset the machine. ENJOY the best coffee ever!"
2036,5.0,2019-03-15,기계 전용, 그레이,"I bought this for my son, he is older. He LOVES IT! I wanted to get him something special. This did it! Works well and taste awesome! GO FOR IT!"
2037,5.0,2019-10-10,기계 + 캡슐 VertuoLine, 잉크 블랙.,I love everything about this. 100%. Better than Keurig hands down 100%. Everything about this.
2038,5.0,2019-09-08,기계 전용, 그레이,Stayed at a friend’s house and used their Nespresso for a week. Bought one for ourselves as soon as we got home. Pods are a little spendy and I wish they would bring back the Alto (14 oz.) ones but the coffee is wonderful (good enough that we stopped using our Keurig machine).
2039,5.0,2018-11-25,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I love my Nespresso although after a few weeks my included frother started frother on to the counter. The rubber casket on the top doesn't hold and allows the froth to run down the side.
After calling customer service and listening to 10 minutes of BS about how its my milk or milk level and the cap isn't included in the warranty because its a spare part I hung up. I don't know if this customer service agent represents the Company's attitude toward customer service but for a 10. part after only six weeks it is a very petty approach to some that is buying a few hundred dollars in coffee a month. Ill buy my own lid from Amazon. Thanks for a lot Nespresso."
2040,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,We purchased this for our office and everyone seems to love both the coffee maker and the selection of different coffee flavors and types.
2041,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 + 캡슐 VertuoLine, 잉크 블랙.,I love it one of the best purchases I ever made
2042,5.0,2020-01-07,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Great life changing coffee
2043,5.0,2019-06-17,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I’ve had a Keurig for years but wanted the convenience of making my own espresso at home. So far, this machine has done very well. It’s fast — even faster than the Keurig — not too noisy and the espresso tastes great. I use the smaller pods for a single shot of espresso. They aren’t the cheapest — this is the Vertuo line that has its own pods — but I only drink a shot in the morning so I don’t go through them that quickly. This model also comes with a milk frother if you want to use it. A nice convenience, and easier and cheaper than going to a coffee shop."
2044,5.0,2018-12-27,기계 전용, 그레이,This makes a really good cup of coffee or espresso. The only complaint is the pods are a little pricey. But nespresso recycles all their pods and will send you a prepaid bag to mail back the used ones.
2045,5.0,2021-11-23,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"Absolutely PERFECT, delicious coffee and espresso drinks with warmed and frothed milk. I LOVE THIS MACHINE!! So easy to set up and use. Best Christmas present I ever bought myself!"

2047,3.0,2018-09-16,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"When it works, it makes great coffee. We purchased this in November of 2021 and have had the machine for just shy of three months. In the beginning, it worked fine but after about a month, it just stopped working and would blink Red when you tried to make a cup of coffee. At that point, I cleaned and descaled it and it worked again for about another week or so. Then, blinking red light again. Cleaned and descaled another time with no success. I called Nespresso customer care and we got it working, it made two cups of coffee and stopped again. I didn't have time to call Nespresso so it sat on the counter for two weeks and we tried again and had coffee for two weeks. Then, the same issue. Nespresso is now sending us a replacement machine. This also happened to my daughter's machine so beware this may be a common defect with the machine design. Also, make sure you clean it weekly and eject the cartridge after each use -- this was a tip from the customer care person at Nespresso."
2048,5.0,2019-03-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Love this machine for the flavor of the coffee that it gives of. No other machine makes it like Nespresso.
2049,5.0,2019-10-10,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Delicious Coffee. Milk frother does not create milk hot enough for hot chocolate but does it's job.
2050,5.0,2019-09-08,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I love being able to place one pod in the machine, and have a perfectly fresh cup of espresso each time I brew one. It is easy, quick and tastes divine. The Aeroccino machine makes a delightful whipped topping if you wish and it makes the serving hot or cold based on your desire. PERFECT!"
2051,5.0,2018-11-25,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"Works well so far, makes good expresso and coffee, I'm pleased."
2052,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,I have been intimidated of buying this for so long. I really wish I had bought it sooner!
2053,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 레드,Machine by De'Longhi is so much better than the one that Nespresso has. We have been through 2 Nespresso machines in a year. We got another one on eBay which worked once then quit. All of the Nespresso ones leak into the pod collection area and create a mess. The De'Longhi one has worked SOOOO much better and faster. We are very pleased with it. The coffee is very good. Our use of Starbucks has plummeted!
2054,4.0,2019-01-10,머신 + 에어로, 타이탄.,"I love the heavy quality feel of this machine. It’s too new to tell if will have issues like some reviews mentioned. I got it for my hubby for Christmas and he is loving the coffee. It comes with a variety of coffee choices kinda like a box of See’s Candy. We mostly use the Melozzio. We look forward to coffee that much more every morning. We were using a “Cuisinart Grind & Brew”, it’s great but the hassle of grinding and brewing an 8 cup carafe every day and the clean-up is not very practical. I have to say this is going cost about $90 vs. $25 per month. We may go back and forth between machines. It’s hard to find the pods in the store, but Amazon has them in stock. I probably should of got the one with the other pods style as they sell those at Costco. I recommend it."
2055,5.0,2019-02-03,기계 전용, 그레이,"I love my Nespresso. I did have to look up instructions online because the ones in my box didn’t explain it super easily, but that wasn’t too hard. I bought my own milk steamer because the ones sold with some of these don’t get great reviews. The coffee is amazing and fast. Definitely worth the money."
2056,4.0,2022-02-12,기계 전용, 그레이,"While this is not a barista level espresso machine, it’s pretty good for the price you pay.

One complaint I have is the flimsy and slippery cup stand/shelf. As the espresso is brewing, your cup will slide outward due to the vibration of the machine. If the shelf had a rubberized surface it wouldn’t be an issue."
2057,5.0,2019-01-17,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Coffee has never been so easy and delicious! This Nespresso machine is so easy to use and even empties itself after each cup of coffee. I love it!
2058,5.0,2022-08-12,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,Gift for my daughter. She uses it daily. She said it is the greatest thing ever
2059,5.0,2022-01-24,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Love the quality and the ease of use.
2060,5.0,2019-11-03,기계 전용, 그레이,"I Love my 1st. Nespresso Vertuo Plus Coffee Machine that I bought through Amazon in December, 2018.
I decided to purchase another one & give the old one to my Daughter, since I will be moving to another place. We enjoy all sorts of coffee capsules that We both have purchase through Amazon as well directly online with Nespresso USA, these past years, they are the best!!! I know that the Vertuo Capsules can be very expensive using it on a daily basis, but it’s worth it!!
We also have 2 other types of coffee machines @ home, but honestly, I couldn’t personally go back using them. It’s the best investment I have done and if you take good care of it, it will last a lifetime. Sincerely, Magdalena"
2061,5.0,2022-08-03,기계 전용, 그레이,"I bought this Nespresso for the office, and already had the Verturo Next at home. This is inline with great quality products for Nespresso, and I have no complaints.

One neat feature on this model is the lid has a motor to open and close where you put the pod in rather than manually opening it. You simply push up on the front lever to open it, down to close it and in seconds you will have an amazing cup of coffee waiting for you."
2062,5.0,2020-01-19,머신 + 에어로, LE 블랙 매트,"I have had my machine for a week now and I am obsessed! Super easy to use and super easy to clean. Makes the most amazing coffee, better than any coffee shop. Would definitely recommend, came super fast and packaged well. Love that it comes with a sample pack of coffee’s too."
2063,5.0,2022-02-12,기계 전용, 그레이,"This Nespresso is delicious. Many different blends and all so delicious. Hot or cold, you going to love it."
2064,1.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 그레이,Item was returned
2065,5.0,2018-11-28,기계 전용, 블랙,"I wish I would’ve have listened to my colleague a while back and purchased this expresso machine much earlier!
I love it so much I look forward to mornings every day before work. I don’t think I can ever go back to drinking regular coffee anymore in my life. It’s very simple to use and coffee taste delicious. Although pods do cost more but hey, it’s still cheaper than going to Starbucks! Also, it’s good to treat yourself with some good coffee in this world we live in. I think we all deserve that. I totally recommend this machine trust me you won’t regret getting it. A great investment."
2066,5.0,2022-08-05,기계 전용, 레드,"I'm in love with my newest Nespresso ! Ahh such ease of use, wonderful aroma and delicious taste."
2067,5.0,2018-12-26,머신 + 에어로, LE 블랙 매트,Love the taste.
2068,5.0,2017-03-15,기계 전용, 그레이,The taste of the coffee is so much better than my keurig. I love this
2069,5.0,2017-06-24,기계 전용, 그레이,"This stuff makes good crema and the flavor is strong. I frequently make iced and hot drinks with this and have use it every day, sometimes two times a day since I bought it."
2070,5.0,2017-05-28,머신 + 에어로, LE 블랙 매트,"I’m not a coffee snob, but I do enjoy good coffee, and I think all the pods we’ve tried so far easily are way better than any Keurig pod I’ve ever had. Also the average price for the pods are right about what the keurig cups cost at my grocery store.

I love that the machine will automatically adjust the volume by the pod size. But I think what I like most is the temp comes out hot enough that I can start sipping it without burning my tongue. With the keurig I’m impatient and always put 5 ice cubes in to drop the temp enough to drink it, but I don’t have to do that anymore, so I’m very pleased. The frother also works really well and you can do hot or cold froth. For the price and convenience I think this is an awesome machine, and currently kicks the crap out of our keurig.

Again I’m not a barista so I’m sure you can make better coffee with a grinder and some fancy way to brew it. But if you’re already using the keurig as your coffee method, this is way better!"
2071,5.0,2018-01-05,기계 전용, 그레이,"Easy to use, simple. I had a Nespresso espresso maker and I always added water to make an Americano. This machine makes a full 8oz cup of coffee which is nice and rich. It’s perfect.
I’m trying the different varieties but prefer the flavored pods."
2072,5.0,2022-01-24,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I'm just going to say that I love everything, it's perfect! Early Christmas present for me. 🤍

•I will update my review if anything changes."
2073,5.0,2017-11-27,기계 전용, 레드,Love that Nespresso recycles the aluminum pods and the fast is awesome.
2074,5.0,2022-06-04,머신 + 에어로, 블랙,"I like this machine. It's solidly built. It doesn't feel cheap to me. It's really easy to use and I like that it automatically collects the pods for you in it's storage compartment. It's super simple to use. You just fill up the tank with water, insert a coffee pod, then press the coffee button. It's pretty quick and it brews the coffee nicely. I did have to exchange my first machine because it was not brewing so I was concerned these machines were finnicky and prone to problems. After I received my new machine I see now that the first was just an outlier and it overall appears to be a easy going well functioning machine."
2075,5.0,2017-03-18,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,2 weeks in and I still love this machine. The ONLY complaint is that the frother won’t froth cinnamon powder into my milk.
2076,5.0,2017-12-15,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I always loved this coffee machine.
And will always be my favorite choice.
Give the exact espresso flavor."
2077,3.0,2018-11-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,Never makes the same amount of coffee.Taste is different every time .Not always good.
2078,4.0,2022-07-08,기계 전용, 그레이,"Purchased this machine to upgrade my 8 years old original Nespresso machine. I like how quiet it is and how fast it heads up! Coffee is very good as I am used to with my original line. Like the option to have 5 different coffee sizes (although I am a heavy espresso drinker) I went with this machine over a manual one mainly because of the speed, maybe some day I will have enough time in the mornings to perform a Barista. For now I am happy with my purchase."
2079,5.0,2017-06-04,기계 전용, 레드,This is a great cup of coffee. All kinds and they are wonderful.
2080,5.0,2017-12-11,기계 전용, 블랙,Love this coffee....we have one at work and I had to have one of my own. No regrets...relax and indulge. Next to French press it's my fave!
2081,5.0,2019-01-02,기계 전용, 그레이,"Had an original Nespresso and wanted a newer machine. Decided to get a vertuo for the increased variety. After reading tons of reviews, I finally decided on the Vertuo plus. So far so good after a couple months of daily usage. A lot quieter then my previous machine and love the option to get double shots and full cups of coffee from 1 pod."
2082,5.0,2022-05-29,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I love this! Makes a great frothy cup of coffee, or espresso. Looks beautiful and coffee options taste great.."

2085,5.0,2018-01-14,기계 전용, 그레이,SO MUCH FLAVOR.
2086,4.0,2021-12-28,머신 + 에어로, 그레이,"I've only had my Nespresso machine for a short time but I am IN LOVE with it already. I did watch a lot of YouTube videos instead of reading the pamphlets and it's so easy to use! I also love the frother, it's so easy to use and I can now make hot milk without having to use my stove/microwave. I also love that this machine has a self cleaning mode!!!

The only thing I have noticed is how loud the machine is. Maybe it's because I'm still getting used to this machine opposed to a Keurig, but it's a very minor thing. Overall I still highly recommend this machine, and all of the flavors Nespresso has is just amazing so I'm excited to try them all!"
2087,5.0,2017-12-11,기계 전용, 레드,Nice and elegant
2088,5.0,2017-12-15,기계 전용, 블랙,This machine has changed the way I do mornings. The coffee and espresso are amazing with so many options. Super easy to use. Really puts some pep in your step. Highly recommend!
