0,5.0,2018-08-07,베스트 셀러 팩,"I really enjoy this coffee , but, there is not much of a selection. Everything is for the Nespresso original but not Virtuoline. Yes you could by the foil lids and refill whatever you want, but that defeats the purpose of investing in a better brewer"
1,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,You need something quick and to start your day. These pods are it. The coffee is fresh and if you need a light roast or something to kick your ass into gear. This coffee is the best. Our go to in the morning. Quick and easy. On the go coffee. Will buy again.
2,5.0,2022-09-23,베스트 셀러 팩,"It's usually not the freshness I have to worry about these days with vendors, but the actual pods being damaged or dented. I have purchased 4 sleeves every month for the past few months with ZERO issues or delays!

happy customer here!
Thanks"
3,5.0,2022-09-16,베스트 셀러 팩,I love a cup of Nespresso. I like coffee but Nespresso is a unique treat. It has a smooth silky texture and rich and robust taste. It always has a froth layer on top. I like to drink out of a clear glass so the layers are visible. Some mornings an average cup of coffee will not do! So I reach for the best! It is a little pricey but much less than my favorite barista store fronts!
4,5.0,2022-09-14,베스트 셀러 팩,I love that I can quickly make a delicious cup of coffee so quickly without having to drive to get a good cup of coffee!
5,5.0,2022-08-23,베스트 셀러 팩,"Anything pod I purchase from Nespresso is fantastic. We order all different varieties, and love them all."
6,5.0,2022-09-19,베스트 셀러 팩,"I love these because they come overnight and they’re waiting for you first thing in the morning.
But unfortunately, my Odacio package was opened and two pods were missing. I’ve never had that happen before.🙁"
7,5.0,2022-09-23,베스트 셀러 팩,All I can say is it beats the price at the Nespresso site. And was here in 2 days. All flavors are delish. Worth the money. Will definitely be ordering again. 5 star.
8,5.0,2022-09-11,베스트 셀러 팩,Like the variety and its on my doorstep

11,5.0,2022-09-20,베스트 셀러 팩,"I will not drink mediocre coffee. I only like the good stuff. This is it. Always fresh & aromatic, and the thick, foamy top is best!"
12,5.0,2018-08-07,베스트 셀러 팩,"We’ve used these pods a few times and they’re always great. And it’s a great deal especially if you usually go out for coffee, saves a lot of money and it’s just as good"
13,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,"These pods are pricey no matter where you buy them, but Amazon gets them to us quickly when we run out!"

23,5.0,2022-09-10,베스트 셀러 팩,Good flavor!
24,5.0,2018-08-07,베스트 셀러 팩,"While I'll admit the pods aren't cheap, you can't beat foof-y cafe latte feel in the comfort of your own slippers! The coffee or espresso provided in these pods is strong (I get the higher numbers usually) but the end frothiness makes it all feel luxurious so I don't mind that these probably aren't the best 'bargain' option. My only suggestion would be that the Amazon provider also include the handy recycling bag that Nespresso offers when you order directly from them so as to be eco-conscious!"
25,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,My wife and I love our Nespresso machine and these pods are perfect. Flavors are great and the price is right.
26,5.0,2022-09-11,베스트 셀러 팩,This is a great mix to figure out what you like. Overpriced but very smooth!
27,5.0,2022-09-13,베스트 셀러 팩,These are super tasty. I’m addicted to them already. Almost time to reorder. I’m thinking about using them as stocking stuffers for Xmas as well.
28,5.0,2022-09-13,베스트 셀러 팩,My wife and I love all three flavors. The are distinctly different but all with full bodied flavor.
29,5.0,2022-09-20,베스트 셀러 팩,Our favorite flavor was Stormio!
30,5.0,2022-08-02,베스트 셀러 팩,Love the Nespresso Coffee Maker and ordering the coffee on line is easy. I have auto delivery. Sure wouldn’t want to run out. Wish they cost a bit less. But I will continue to order and enjoy my two cups in the morning.
31,5.0,2022-09-02,베스트 셀러 팩,I love the taste but it is too expensive to be used everyday.
32,5.0,2022-09-11,베스트 셀러 팩,"So long as you like the system, it's great (little expensive though)"

35,5.0,2022-09-12,베스트 셀러 팩,Nespresso has a rich and bold taste to each and every one of their coffee pods. Absolutely love Nespresso coffee.
36,5.0,2018-08-07,베스트 셀러 팩,"These are economically the same as ordering from Nespresso, except that I can get my Amazon points.
Seem to be very equivalent in every way. The only drawback is that you don't receive any RECYCLING BAGS as you get for free from Nespresso."
37,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,My new favorite coffee!
38,5.0,2022-08-16,베스트 셀러 팩,We’ve ordered this before and not only is the flavor and the quality amazing but i ordered last night just to wake up to it being delivered before 7 am. Amazing customer service
39,5.0,2022-09-01,베스트 셀러 팩,"I appreciate the consistent tasty flavor in these coffee pods for our Nespresso machine. Packaged in 3 flavors, it also gives us some variety."
40,5.0,2022-09-04,베스트 셀러 팩,"Love the coffee but they don't provide bags for recycling pods in every box. I can't throw away aluminum pods. Need more bags,please!"
41,5.0,2022-09-02,베스트 셀러 팩,"Good mix of coffees if you're not feeling too adventurous with your Nespresso, or just need something more fitting for everyday consumption. The Melozio, in my opinion, is a great baseline flavor, with Odacio and Stormio each getting stronger."
42,5.0,2022-09-13,베스트 셀러 팩,Excellent product
43,5.0,2022-08-24,베스트 셀러 팩,This is a great product however I've had a lot of difficulty getting my Amazon deliveries here they always seem to get lost. I have started ordering these directly from Nespresso and they are the exact same price anyways with much more reliable tracking notifications
44,5.0,2022-08-12,베스트 셀러 팩,These are great in case you run out they can be delivered quickly and are a little cheaper. They are the ones sold by Nespresso so they are quality.
45,5.0,2022-09-08,베스트 셀러 팩,Rico se las recomiendo es un café divino
46,5.0,2022-08-15,베스트 셀러 팩,"The pods and the machine are pricy, but I cannot find a coffee that’s anywhere near as good as these pods. It kinda ruined all other coffees for me."
47,5.0,2022-08-22,베스트 셀러 팩,Muy rico su sabor excelente
48,5.0,2018-08-07,베스트 셀러 팩,"It is a great variety pack with 3 flavors. My only complaint was one of the sleeves with the cartridges had 3 of them busted open. There was coffee all over in the Box, then opened the sleeves and found 3 damaged servings. If more of the capsules would of been broken I'd be bummed. So consider that then when ordering this type of product online."
49,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,I love that this brings mild to strong flavors.
50,5.0,2022-08-19,베스트 셀러 팩,pure and good smelling espresso ! love em

 I just got the nespresso and I was worried about quality but this knocked it out of the park. Perfect"
61,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,So much faster than a Nespresso.
62,5.0,2022-08-21,베스트 셀러 팩,Better than Starbucks at a fraction of the cost AND I don't have to leave the house!
63,5.0,2022-08-21,베스트 셀러 팩,I personally enjoy it very much!
64,5.0,2022-08-11,베스트 셀러 팩,"Since we moved further from our local nespresso store we started ordering here on Amazon. The quality of coffee is no different and this trio happens to be my favorite coffee pods of all. We are so happy we set it up on Amazon auto delivery.

We had ordered our coffee a few times before we moved on nespressos website but it took so long for us to receive and who has time to wait 5-7 days for their coffee.

All in all Amazon wins."

68,4.0,2022-08-03,베스트 셀러 팩,"Some of the reviews say these are NOT made by Nespresso, they are fake in fake packaging. Can anyone prove this? I find it hard to believe on a product sponsored by Nespresso are shipping fake product."

72,5.0,2018-08-07,베스트 셀러 팩,Nespresso is the best! It’s so delicious. This is a good price and comparable to their website.
73,4.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,"I switched to Nespresso simply because they have the best single cup coffees available, and the three included in this package are among my favorites. The only negatives to Nespresso coffees, in general, are price and availability. The Nespresso capsules are considerably more expensive than any of their competitor's products. Additionally, since they recently closed our only local Nespresso Boutique, I am relegated to buying the capsules online. The ability to purchase the capsules is a great convenience because they arrive much quicker than if purchased directly through Nespresso, and the prices are the same. The only things lacking from Amazon are the variety of coffees, free gifts included in direct purchases, and the lack of recycle bags for used Nespresso capsules. I have received recycle bags in two of the packages I purchased from Amazon, but this is not nearly enough. I wish Amazon would include a recycle bag in each box of capsules."
74,5.0,2022-09-26,베스트 셀러 팩,"There are several varieties of coffee pods to choose from. Order a bunch and decide for yourself which ones are your favorite! We like them all. Some are more bitter than others, but some days that's what you want!
I would reorder these pods again, and from this vendor."
75,4.0,2022-08-08,베스트 셀러 팩,excelente lo recomiendo
76,4.0,2022-08-01,베스트 셀러 팩,I say the flavors are okay not my favorite I like my coffee Iced and just had a hard time making Ice coffee with these and they didn’t go well with the creamer I like. So if you like warm coffee and a lot than you might like these.
77,5.0,2022-08-09,베스트 셀러 팩,the coffee tastes amazing!!! they really know how to make coffee.
78,5.0,2022-06-18,베스트 셀러 팩,"3 different flavors, one better than the other. My favorite is Stormio. A must buy for coffee and dark roast lovers."

85,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,"I love that there are three varieties and strengths here. Depending on my mood, I may want to be a little more caffeinated than at other times. It gives me options and I like options."
86,5.0,2022-07-31,베스트 셀러 팩,I love my Nespresso and these pods are excellent.
87,4.0,2022-08-03,베스트 셀러 팩,Why does everyone always sell the same basic flavors? This one is exceptional I just wish they had more flavors. Make it happen.
88,5.0,2022-07-22,베스트 셀러 팩,"I love that you get a variety of flavors with this pack. I think it’s a great way to try out what you like and also makes a great gift for someone with a nespresso! For me, personally, I did not enjoy the odacio flavor in this. It’s very fruity and acidic and it’s just not my cup of tea (haha). But that’s 100% a personal preference. If you don’t like fruity/acidic coffee, I may recommend going with a different pack because 10 of the 30 pods wouldn’t suit your taste. But otherwise I think it’s great!"
89,5.0,2022-02-14,베스트 셀러 팩,3 flavors varying in strength love nespresso vertuo line such a great coffee. These pods are perfect to drink alone or with milk.

91,5.0,2022-07-16,베스트 셀러 팩,"I really look forward to a fresh cup of coffee every morning since I bought the delicious Nespresso coffee pods. They’re so full of flavor and freshness, I no longer feel the need to purchase a cup of coffee from a coffee shop. I have the coffee shop at home."
92,5.0,2022-06-10,베스트 셀러 팩,So delicious! But if you can’t tolerate strong coffee I would recommend get a lower roast.
93,4.0,2022-07-17,베스트 셀러 팩,Got the wrong ones for my machine. Couldn't use them to taste. Everything else was great. Shipping and speed in which they came in.
94,5.0,2022-07-09,베스트 셀러 팩,I look forward to my Nespresso coffee every morning. My favorite and ready quickly.
95,4.0,2022-07-19,베스트 셀러 팩,"Cost way to much use reusable pods, but reusable pods sometimes don’t work well in your unit."
96,5.0,2018-08-07,베스트 셀러 팩,Great tasting and great variety. But you need a Nespresso coffee maker and it is one of a little more expensive coffees.
97,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,The coffee is awesome! Great taste. Not bitter!
98,5.0,2022-07-09,베스트 셀러 팩,I bought these for my kids for Christmas. They absolutely love the flavors of this coffee and the quality. I highly recommend it for anyone.
99,5.0,2022-07-15,베스트 셀러 팩,Excelente inversión!!
100,5.0,2022-07-10,베스트 셀러 팩,"The people giving this machine negative reviews and saying a Keurig is better… I actually laughed out loud. This machine is 3,000 times better than any Keurig I’ve owned and I have had several. Yes, the coffee does not get scorching hot, but that’s a huge benefit in my mind. The coffee brews in less than 30 seconds and then is drinkable without burning your mouth immediately. The pods may be more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Their flavors are top notch, and truly taste as good or better than any coffee you can get in a coffee shop. I don’t see myself stopping at Starbucks anytime in the future. I can now make incredible coffee at home. Ten stars."

103,4.0,2022-06-23,베스트 셀러 팩,I really love my nespresso machine and these flavors I just wish u could customize the flavors u want when u are ordering on Amazon without having to buy the flavors by themselves or in these pre picked sets especially if ur a subscriber I think u should be able to pick and choose whichever flavors u want to buy .
104,5.0,2022-07-08,베스트 셀러 팩,"The variety pack gives you 3 different flavors and intensity. Works for us, especially the quick delivery."

106,5.0,2022-04-08,베스트 셀러 팩,"I love the fact that I don't have to rely on going all the way to a Nespresso store to re-up on my coffee because I don't live near one. Plus, it arrived so fast! Also, I love the variety pack option instead of just getting one flavor."
107,5.0,2022-06-27,베스트 셀러 팩,"It's really great coffee. I haven't tried all the varieties yet, but, so far, they have all been good. The brewer will have a cup of great coffee in less than 2 minutes--start to finish, including warm up."

Yes, the company needs to return a profit, but the pods are on the expensive side ($1.10 to $1.50 each). I think most people could live with $0.75 per pod, and Nespresso would still make a handsome profit."

175,5.0,2022-04-27,베스트 셀러 팩,For serious coffee lovers. Nespresso never disappoints. I spent a lot of money and proudly held a gold card at SB. Everyday I would get SB coffee.

One cup keeps me going all day and the flavors are amazing.

Nespresso pods as they are originally made for their machines, they are always extremely consistent, excellent flavor, lots of foam and quality coffee with great flavor.
Paying a little extra for something original, beats the hassle and eliminates the disappointment."

205,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She WAS a Starbucks addict. Since she started using the Nespresso she’s not gone out of her way to get her Starbucks and says the flavor she gets from our Nespresso is not only better but is perfect to her tastes. We love it and talk about value for the money? I’d say that at $5.00 a cup at Starbucks vs. a little over a dollar for a cup at home is pretty cool. Our Keurig will be sitting in the garage as a backup. My only complaint would be the water reservoir is not as large as I’d like but it’s still easy enough to refill. I also LOVE that the company sends preaddressed and postage paid bags to drop off at UPS the used pods. Kudos to George Clooney for his funny commercials that got us interested!

And, it's so rich that I only drink one in the AM. The dark roast isn't speedy. I found the medium roast to have more caffeine which makes sense. The lighter the roast, the more caffeine."

301,4.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,"Price over convenience. For a heavy coffee or espresso drinker a mug is $3 or more. May as well go out and have someone serve you.
If you sip I suppose it's ok. But the price per capsule is just over $1. Got money to burn it's not an issue.
Aside from the convenient capsule and cool machine before you buy and end up returning do the math. A 12 cup pot of coffee made at home comes in at under $1 per pot. 12 cups of this is $13 and you need 2 boxes. Per month I would go through 1 pot of coffe per day. That's about $33 a month for coffee and filters. If you used 12 capsules a day you would pay over $390 a month in espresso capsules. Do your math first."

I justify buying these pods as awarding myself for being an awesome human LOL !!!

319,5.0,2021-10-21,베스트 셀러 팩,My girlfriend loves her nespresso machine so much so I had to order one so she wouldn't rush home for her morning coffee. This is the same quality and price as if you purchased from nespresso.com. I like that you can get a variety pack to try different ones. May order a few more of these to try different kinds. BEWARE... Buying from different sellers you will pay more. I have found misleading descriptions where you think you are getting a whole pack but you get less and pay more. Also there are sellers that are selling the european version which is the same coffee but they are charging more. I would only buy from Amazon and amazon only sells in 3 pack quantities.

However, I will complain that the vertuo pods are much more expensive that the old nespresso pods which is something that should be considered by the company. All that being said, I love a strong coffee and was excited to try these flavors but was sadly underwhelmed. I only enjoyed the gold pods and tried EVERYTHING to enjoy the other flavors from different creamers to almond vs 2% milk- etc. I just found the notes to be too overwhelming for your average morning cup."
326,5.0,2022-02-05,베스트 셀러 팩,"It’s do-your-own-coffee these days, so better make it as good as you can. Nespresso does that, and the pods are recyclable which I love. Easy to use, the machine tosses the old one into a compartment when you go to add a new pod. Clear out the old pods once a week and take them to a Nespresso store (or maybe recycle on line?? Not sure.) I choose the darkest roast coffee which is strong and bitter, but there are a variety of mellower kinds to pick from. And Amazon Prime gets my replacements here so fast, I don’t have to panic when I am running low."

339,5.0,2022-04-13,베스트 셀러 팩,"This is one of the perfect variety packs for anyone with a new Nespresso, because it has a variety of medium and dark roasts pods, but doesn't commit you to too many like some of their variety packs with 40 or 50 pods. It comes with their best-tasting dark flavor - Stormio, and probably their second best medium roast - Melozio. I really like that Nespresso gives their roasts an intensity level. Even though their flavor names aren't completely transparent, the intensity level makes it easy to see that Odacio is a medium intensity right in between Stormio and Melozio."

I like this machine better, the coffee is hotter and the froth is richer and thicker. I also enjoyed the starter pack that came with it. It helped us learn a little more about the coffee and each type. the flavors are not as good as I would think. They are fairly bitter but with the milk from the frothier it is sooo good .

The capsules arrived fine, my favorites are the Melozio and the Odacio (the Stormio is the strongest but not my cup of tea--er, coffee). I live in New York City so it's not hard to find somewhere that sells the Nespresso, but it's also not incredibly convenient.

Nespresso has been in the capsule coffee business long enough to have a variety of terrific flavors. They know what they are doing and they do it well.

My only complaint and reason for only four stars is the price. At almost a dollar a cup, there are other options that check the quick coffee/espresso box with a better price to quality ratio."

My husband got me a new Nespresso machine for Christmas so I had to order these capsules a few days ahead of time, so I'd be prepared to make some coffee immediately; I didn't know the machine he got me already came with some sample capsules. For those of you that are questioning these capsules being authentic or not due to the logo, I can tell you they are, the capsules that came with my new Nespresso machine have the exact same logo (see the photos)."

The green and blue are almost identical, strong-flavorful, and the tan is very, very ,mild. The small size espresso shot (dark blue) is by far the best variety and the green is the closest one to that in a full size. Why Nespresso does not make the espresso shot variety in a full size is beyond me! The tan variety is not worth $1.10 each."

445,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,Excellent flavors and quality. The only thing that I couldn’t handle was the strength of the Stormio. I got nausea and had to throw up. I barely made it to half a cup before I started feeling sick. I’m going to stick to the other milder flavors and the expressso pods so it’s strength in smaller portions. Hopefully one day I can build up to the Stormio because the flavor is very strong and bold

The downside is some of the pods came damaged, and I wasn’t sure how to contact Amazon about it... but when I did the return process on the app, they told me I could keep the product still and issued the refund immediately. I am extremely happy about that. It gives me the confidence to order again and give it another shot!"

469,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,No more Starbucks and a touch of luxury at home. Best coffee of all the single serve brands. These capsules make 7.8 oz but the stronger Stormio can be run twice to make a larger cup like the Alto size 14 oz. The price difference between the 7.8 oz ($1.10) and 14 oz ($1.20) capsules is 10 cents but if your out of the Alto is works in a pinch.
470,5.0,2021-05-13,베스트 셀러 팩,I get these as a repeat order. Bold rich flavor and the Nespresso machine whips up a great frothy cup.

496,5.0,2021-09-17,베스트 셀러 팩,Absolutely love the coffee but it stinks you can only get it online and it’s twice as expensive as a Kuerig pod. The flavors are amazing but you should be able to purchase the coffee in stores instead of paying $1+ per pod.

Now the supplier says they can’t deliver a replacement to our address (they didn’t have any trouble sending the first one to our address). The whole process is very odd, and despite the fact that I like this product I’m giving this one star due to the seller."

Any chance possible I love to poke my fingers in big corporations eyes. with all other coffee makers people have found a way to give you cheaper versions of the coffee pods or allow you to create your own. Nespresso spent who knows how much money trying to engineer capsules that could not be re used but it probably took 30 minutes for someone smart to figure out how to re-use these. Search google/amazon and you will find many kits with aluminum labels that you can use your own coffee to make your own pods. I bought 3 or 4 boxes of these and saved all the aluminum pods removing the old top. you can buy mycaps, recaps or 3 other vendors who sell cheap aluminum foil tops. ... every 2-3 weeks i refill 50-60 pods and it takes me 45 seconds per pod. I save $1000 a year easy and my coffee is 10X better than theirs."

The pods themselves were not damaged and I used them all just fine, but that would have stunk if I was buying these to give as a gift as it made what is normally such a sleekly-designed product look awful."
559,5.0,2021-09-16,베스트 셀러 팩,I love the taste! Best cup of java/espresso I’ve ever had. (yes that’s including Starbucks.) These capsules are a bit expensive... but sure beats paying $6 elsewhere!

I have the Breville machine which does a perfect cup every time. Only complaint is the price and not sure how Earth friendly these pods are. TG I can buy them online. In Europe you have to belong to a club to get these things."
616,5.0,2021-08-20,베스트 셀러 팩,Delicious coffee! Sleek packaging and nice that the ends pop off so you can store the rest. Flavors are great! Do wish these were more affordable.

That said, you'll pay more than $1.00 for each cup you brew at home, as compared to 10 to 30 cents with any other single serve coffee maker. Nespresso has a monopoly on the ""pods"" by virtue (no pun intended) of a patent that bars anyone else from making pods that fit the virtuo machines. Great coffee, but think twice."

664,3.0,2021-03-10,베스트 셀러 팩,"I didn’t read the description correctly. I thought these were espresso pods for my new Nespresso machine. They are regular coffee, not espresso. And they’re strong, even for me, and I like a big bold flavor. They almost taste like instant coffee, which I loathe. My solution was to make lattes out of them, and that works for me. I had to order espresso pods right away, though. I’ll use these for lattes, and will take them as my to-go cups on my way to work. Like I said, my mistake, but they are really strong for a regular daily coffee."
665,5.0,2021-05-10,베스트 셀러 팩,I love these flavors. It’s the perfect medium roast combination. The dark is just dark enough. I also like how big of a coffee all of these make. Highly recommend getting a frother if you don’t have one already - makes the coffee even better.
666,3.0,2021-07-12,베스트 셀러 팩,"This is definitely some of the best tasting coffee your are going to have, unfortunately really don’t understand what the issue is with the presentation (vendor or company). I have purchased directly from nespresso and it was flawless but it does take a few days so I figured amazon would be quicker, it was but it look like they were all rejected from nespresso. The good thing was the presentation did not affect the taste but some of those pods were questionable if they were even going to work. If you have the time I recommend buying directly but if you are on a bind then this is as good as it gets. Buy at your own risk."

673,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,The fact that Nespresso uses barcoded k-cups that determine the best water to coffee mix for each different type of coffee/espresso they offer is tremendous. The end result is a cup of packet coffee dsr superior to what I get at most American coffee cafes.

690,4.0,2020-10-17,베스트 셀러 팩,This was one of the better prices I was able to find online. About $1 per pod. They all tasted good and worked in my Nespresso maker. It does fill up a mug and is frothy without adding foamed milk.

Some users have mentioned having difficulty loading the final back row. This only occurs if you load the pods front to back. Load back to front—everything fits just fine.

For the price, it is sturdy and looks great! Highly recommend this product."

The most recent batch I purchased here made me sick, and I know it was the pods because I took a break from these and drank other dark coffee from my local coffee shops instead, and on those days I felt fine! It was specifically on the days I drank these coffee pods that I felt sick immediately after. Very strange. I’ve had these pods before and they didn’t cause this issue. So bad batch? I wouldn’t order them from amazon again."

I pay over a $100 a year for prime and it's 2 day delivery. Now it's going to be 4-5 days and will probably arrive at 9pm. What's the point in paying for a service that lately isn't consistent. If you can't commit to a service which I pay for then give me my $100 back"

Amazon had to cancel my original order twice and ""restart"" the order process which turned a two day shipment into over 10 days.. without coffee?! I had to drink the swill from the cafeteria... also way to expensive and the brand new Nespresso machine I purchased has a leak somewhere so now I have to go back to the store and beg them to exchange it... supposed to be a quality product..

You can pair this with the HyperChiller (https://www.amazon.com/HyperChiller-HC1-Iced-Coffee-Maker/dp/B0147K0ZEY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1512707987&sr=8-3&keywords=hyperchiller+iced+coffee+maker) and make amazing iced coffee as well. Hard to beat for just a hair over $1.00 a cup."

Half the coffee's you can't even tell the difference in taste. I buy it because my wife likes it but if it was up to me I would get rid of it. The delivery system is terrible it takes too long to get your order. Sometimes my orders are damaged and I don't bother calling to cry about it. It is not that big of a deal the nespresso club. I'd rather buy coffee by beans grind them myself and put them in a coffee press"

Otherwise, Nespresso Vertuo coffee pods are amazing in taste and super easy to use. As for Nespresso, I wish they would allow third-party brands to make Vertuo pods like they allow for the classic pods, but of course, this would drive down prices because of competition, which they don't want."

1382,1.0,2020-02-20,베스트 셀러 팩,"As other reviews have suggested, these are counterfeit. Let me count the ways that are obvious.

Things that are wrong
-no blend name on foil seal
-strange colors on basic pods
-pours that do not match the actual pod size(copied bar code from another pod)
-real pods have better airseal. These are like a deflated baloon.

God knows what is in these pods."

The pods that were shipped make my nespresso machine leak around the pod holder. After further investigation the pods that were shipped are overfilled.

Perhaps this is why nespresso advices you purchase directly from them and not from amazon."

The value for the money just isn't' there for me, and if I could get a credit for the return I would do it, reclaim counter space etc, but maybe for others the value is there - hard to tell."

If I could give it less stars I would.
it of course is not attaching to the correct product on this order. I assume that is on purpose."

The coffee is pretty good and the machine comes with a nice whipped milk cup.
But, you can buy K-cups for your Keurig for much cheaper and use the whipped milk container with that.

Ecologically speaking, the Nespresso capsules are recyclable while most K-cups are plastic. But, you can get K-cups made from biodegradable materials....or you can get an empty cartridge and fill it with your own ground coffee."

2109,5.0,2019-04-06,베스트 셀러 팩,"This Nespresso “best seller” selection has three different intensity coffee capsules for VertuoLine machines only. This includes 10 each of Stormio (intensity 8), Odacio (intensity 7) and Melozio (6 intensity) that brew larger 7.8 oz cups of coffee rather than the short espresso shots. It’s a good assortment of coffee that’s all rich and flavorful but varies in intensity.

Stormio is a bold, dark roast coffee that’s rich and flavorful. It tastes like a good French Roast that’s strong and rich enough to make a satisfying Café Au Lait (coffee with hot milk) that’s a little smoky but not charred or burnt tasting. Stormio is a pleasing medium bodied coffee with thick foam from the brewing process. It’s lightly acidic and a touch bitter in an enjoyable way. I enjoy Stormio a lot. 5 stars.

Odacio is a blend of light roasted Ethiopian beans and long roasted Nicaraguan beans. It’s rather dark and bold, but also lively. It has a full bodied mouthfeel as it’s thick and creamy. It’s flavorful with cereal notes and lighter fruity notes. This coffee doesn’t taste sweet like my favorite dark roasts that have chocolate or caramel notes, but milk and sugar bring out some sweetness and Odacio is robust and satisfying. 4.5 stars.

Melozio is more of a medium roast that tastes rich and flavorful but still mellow. It’s not too weak or too intense. I’d describe it as medium bodied as it’s not watery or thin. It’s a smooth and balanced coffee that I prefer with milk and sugar to bring out the flavor and sweeter notes, though I drink all my coffee with milk and sugar (or other sweetener). Being less intense, Melozio is a pleasant surprise as I thought it might be too weak for me. 5 stars. Overall, an enjoyable assortment of quality coffee capsules. 5 stars."

2120,5.0,2019-03-01,베스트 셀러 팩,"I'm one of those dudes that can't start my day without my daily cup of joe, especially that first cup in the morning. Instant freeze dried coffee can be economical, convenient and time saving, but they lack taste when compared to freshly brewed counterparts. When it comes to brewed coffee, this is typically accomplished by traditional drip coffemakers w/ carafe or Keurig-style drip coffee via coffee pods. One of the latest & most popular & high-end homebrew coffeemaker is the Nespresso lines of coffee machines, and its myriad of Nespresso coffee pods. If you own one of these machines, typically you'd need a milk Frother as well to make best possible Nespresso style espresso drinks, the challenge isn't how to make it, but with so many varieties and flavors available, WHICH one to choose!

Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, this problem, albeit it a good one, is easily solved, when I discovered the 『Nespresso Capsules VertuoLine, Best Seller Variety Pack』.

The VERDICT
==========
Every Espresso machine owner knows that it can be difficult to search through the variety of VertuoLine pods and capsules. This is one of the nicest things about the Nespresso world – the many choices. But this wide range of products is, of course, also quite confusing.

This Nespresso Capsules VertuoLine contains the entire Nespresso VertuoLine assorted coffee pods from Stormio (10), Odacio (10) & Melozio (10), this is same as strong, medium to light roast. So, my family & I, everyone can have a Nespresso espresso drink with the preferred brewing strength. Absolutely perfectly blend of different strengths, you bound to find one you enjoy.

💞🤩🤩💕☕👍☕ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED☕👍☕💞🤩🥰💕"
2121,4.0,2019-05-31,베스트 셀러 팩,"This is the classic coffee lovers variety pack. It's the first selection I bought when I had used up the few pods that came with my machine, and I continued to buy it until I started dabbling in the single origin pods.

If you're buying this as a gift for someone else, and you don't know what they like, get them this. All three flavors in here are great. Stomio is the strongest, Melozio is the mildest, and Odacio is in between. But all three of them taste bold and engaging to me. Personally, I like to have the Odacio in the morning and a Stormio after lunch. My wife likes the Melozio, so those are for her.

You can either buy your Vertuoline pods from the Nespresso website, or from here. (Or the Nespresso Store if you are lucky enough to live near one). The advantage of the Nespresso website is more selection, including seasonal and single origin flavors. The advantage of Amazon is free delivery even for small orders for Prime members, and overnight delivery in many markets."

2125,5.0,2020-01-30,베스트 셀러 팩,"This medium to dark roast variety pack of coffees is impressive. The numbers corresponding to the strength on the coffees' strength is very accurate to me. The flavors are very rich and deep, with a delightful aroma that fills the kitchen while they are brewing. The darkest one, Stormio, reminds me a bit of some Cuban coffee I had years ago. I had to sip on that one, because it was much stronger than what I'm used to. However, it was good, but it's not a flavor I would drink daily because it is so dark and strong and for me, one to be sipped and savored.

The other two flavors were easier to enjoy, because the strengths and darkness were more familiar to me. I enjoyed trying to discern the different ""notes"" in each. The quality of all 3 flavors felt very high-end to me, much nicer than the typical coffees that I drink daily on a regular basis.

Comparing the quality and flavor of the Nespresso to the other major competing brand, the Nespresso wins hands-down in my opinion. However, it's also more costly than that brand, so that's a definite consideration for me. For those who go out and buy their coffee at coffee shops and are wanting the same (or better) quality and flavor of coffee at home, this is a definite cost-effective and richly flavorful option to consider.

They have a great flavor, and I honestly can't figure out which one is my favorite.

They all make a lovely crema in our Nespresso Vertuoline machine, and we love the richer flavors that make us feel like we have our own personal gourmet coffee barista ready to serve up the most delectable Nespresso whenever we want. I like this set, because it's a happy medium between my husband and I - he likes the darker roasts, and I am more into the medium ones, and these are kinda on those fence lines that satisfy us both, no matter which one we choose out of the 3 in this variety pack.

I like that the flavors are always consistently good. There are a lot of different flavors to try if you like experimenting. I like their intensity scale so I don't have to guess too much about what a new flavor will taste like.

The product description makes a big point about the used pods being recyclable (unlike the disposable Keurig pods). However, you cannot recycle the pods through most city home recycling systems. You need to send the pods back to Nespresso. If you buy the pods directly from Nespresso, they will give you a postage-paid package for you to send the used pods back. Unfortunately, you do not get the recycling package when you buy from Amazon. Minus one star because recycling is a hoax for Amazon customers."

The pods are easy to use in your machine following the instructions for your Nespresso brewer. I love that this includes three different flavors 10 Stormio, 10 Odacio, and 10 Melozio. Each box gives a meter to let you know the intensity of the flavor.

Besides being great coffee the pods are aluminum and you can take them apart, dispose of the coffee and recycle the pods.

These are name brand and came in perfect order. I read a few reviews saying pods were damaged but these came with the three box inside the manufacturers box so there really is no way for them to be damaged.

2145,5.0,2019-02-01,베스트 셀러 팩,"I've had all of these flavor pods in the past and liked them so I thought the variety pack would be great. For some reason with this batch I found I wasn't really enjoying the Melozio compared to the Odacio and Stormio. And between the Odacio and Stormio, I enjoyed the Stormio a little better. Felt the flavor was less muddy than the others.

Overall, I find the Nespresso Vertuoline to be excellent coffees especially when compared to the original Nespresso pods that I would make as Americano. The packaging has changed recently to just dumping the pods into the boxes versus putting them in special sleeves (which were a slight pain to remove the pods from). The pods packaged this way arrived just fine, no damage or denting.

Overall, great coffees.. try them out in something like this variety pack to figure out your preference.

I hope this helps you."

Each have their own taste characteristics—Melozio is very smooth, Odacio is slightly more acidic so brighter and somewhat bolder and Stormio which is dark, rich and bold.

All three brew a 7.77 ounce cup with the usual generous layer of crema. The aluminum pods are recyclable and do not impart any odd flavors unlike some of the plastic pods used with single cup brewers. There is a reason these three varieties are best sellers. Excellent."

Odacio is a Nicaraguan Arabica with cereal note, a splash of acidity, and a delicate fruitiness.
Stormio is a highly roasted blend of Nicaraguan and Guatemalan coffee beans with spicy, woody notes and a hint of cayenne. It has a smooth richness and was my favorite of the three. I drank a cup of my regular brew afterward and it was tasteless.
Melozio is a blend of Brazilian bourbon and Central American Arabicas that is lightly roasted for a smooth, perfectly balanced coffee.
I enjoyed all three blends. They are all quality coffees that are well worth the price. They would make an excellent gift for your favorite coffee drinker, especially if you gave them the brewer, too."

I'm the person that drinks too much caffeine so I often take a steel mug with me to work and it's still great later in the day.(mainly have used the Melozio for this). I don't have the urge to pick up coffee while out, when having it with me.

The flavors are much better than Keurig pods, and Nespresso provides free sleeves to return used pods for recycling, so no guilt necessary. If you want a good introduction to Nespresso's coffees, this three-pack is a great way to go. Odacio is a cerealy blend, a plain and solid cup; Melozio is more flavorful; and Stormio is a strong blend that will put hair on your chest and will definitely wake you up in the morning. Each provides a good froth and a full cup, and is fine with or without cream and sugar, though the cream brings out more subtle flavors. We *always* have Nespresso Vertuoline pods in the kitchen, and these are three fine ways to enjoy the varied flavors. Highly recommended!"

Three different flavors are essentially, light, medium and dark and all are really good, and I think the choices for favorites are all contingent on whether you like a lighter or stronger coffee flavor. These are so good, they don't even need sugar (less calories when having your coffee, which is a plus in my book.)

Easy to order, use and recycle, which is very important to me as I wouldn't use these if they were not ecologically friendly.

Every single flavor/roast/fake italian word of these is absolutely vile.

We found a vertuo machine on the street (first warning, maybe you're smarter than we are), and bought some sleeves of these capsules. We've had regular nespresso and they're not great but they're fun and we have a baby coming. We figured this would be the same. Well joke's on us, because these coffees are so undrinkable we are opting to hang out with our screaming two week old and wait for our good old Mr Coffee to perk up instead of drinking these weirdly foamy, absolutely tooth-shatteringly awful cups of coffee. 0/10 avoid like the plague.

I guess I'd rate these ""giftable"" because I recommend you giving them away as soon as they arrive."

You will not be disappointed with this buy I promise. The price breaks down to about $1.23/cup which is a huge save from the $5 it costs at one of those big chain places."

2301,5.0,2018-05-13,베스트 셀러 팩,"Having owned Nespresso machines both the original line and Venturo line for several years now I feel I’m qualified to give accurate and objective reviews of these products. I do not enjoy or drink flavored coffee so I only order regular coffee never decaf. I tend to favor the dark roast coffees so that is what I always order.

The coffee in Nespresso pods are all high quality and expertly roasted! When I got my first Nespresso machine an original line unit I did try a few of the other brands but none of the knock off brands came close to the taste and quality of the Nespresso product. Even though I could save a few bucks using the knock off pods I came to the conclusion that using the Nespresso brand pods was cheaper than going to Brand “S” to get my coffee fix. Plus it was better for the environment since Nespresso has a recycling plan for its own pods which is easy to participate in unlike the knock off brands which are usually plastic thus not easy to recycle. With the Venturo machine there is no decision to be made the only pods that will work are made by Nespresso. Yes they cost a bit more than those for original line machines, but the brew they make is top quality!
So, if like myself you enjoy good well made coffee I believe the investment in a Venturo machine is worth every penny spent!!"

Please try enjoying this one as it is because you won’t regret it. And lastly…I really wanted to enjoy Odacio but when brewed it doesn’t smell inviting to me. I don’t know what it is but I’m trying to like this one regrettably this Odacio pack is for when I run out of coffee completely.

I am a pour over fan from the old days (1975 Melitta) and French Press so I can enjoy whole bean varieties of my choosing from around the world. There is a work-around to reuse the capsules with our own choice of bean. I do like the recycling measures of Nespresso to reuse the capsules.

I have this on order every 30 days!!!! Super clean as well as there is even a recycling system they have with UPS to dispose of your pods appropriately. My only wish is if I bring a full bag of recycled pods, I wish that would equal a free tube (10 pods) of a flavor of my choice at my local Nespresso store as an incentive to use their recycling system with UPS....."

The gold color is VERY weak and literally not worth drinking.
If you want to drink something that light-tasting, save your $ and just drink tap water."

2444,5.0,2019-10-08,베스트 셀러 팩,"These pods are well worth the money. At only ~$1/pod, they may sound expensive, but compared to what I would spend on a latte at Starbucks-- it's a steal!

Taste: very flavorful. This variety pack is perfect for my husband and I. He likes a strong coffee, I like a medium coffee. This pack is the best of both worlds.

Value: being a previous Keurig lover, I was a little thrown off by the price of the pods when we got the Nespresso machine as a gift. But, the quality of the pods far exceeds the quality of the Keurig pods. Point blank, you get what you pay for. And considering the quality of this product, the value is a steal.

Definitely recommend this variety pack, definitely will be buying again in the future."
