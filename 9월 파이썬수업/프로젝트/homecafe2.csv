0,0,별 5개 중 4.0,미국에서 2022년 9월 16일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"I used to own a Dolce gusto Circolo (beautiful machine) since 2008 probably, for years I thought the machine would quit on me soon so I was conservative ordering pods, but it lasted me almost a decade and half. So now we had to decide which way to go in terms of a replacement machine, you would think after so long there would be lots more options for espresso drinks with the ease of single cup, not really! This system still won out for us in terms of ease and speed of making a cup even if everyone in the family had a different order. Ease of cleanup! This is a big differentiator for me, sure you can barista your own cappuccino with other machines and then you can spend time cleaning up everything, nope! The price for the machine is decent, doesn’t break the bank, quality wise it isn’t as sturdy or elegant as the circolo but it isn’t as expensive either. I hate the red cord! Like nobody was thinking camouflage while designing this thing… I like the dispense auto stop feature compared to the older machines, it helps give a consistent measure and taste. My main beef with this product has been the swinging price and availability of pods since the pandemic. You just cannot turn on a subscribe and save for your favorite pods as the price and seller swings around, no consistency. If this machine lasts half as long as my old one, and the pods pricing and availability stabilizes I would have no regrets buying another Gusto machine. Favorite flavors: caramel macchiato and the au lait."

2,2,별 5개 중 3.0,미국에서 2022년 9월 16일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"PROS
- Doesn't take up much space
- Easy to use machine.
- Easy to use pods (follow the top instructions on the pod).
- It's quick! You flip that switch and the coffee comes out instantly hot.
- Aside from the start up issue, I use it once daily without issue (so far). I've been using it about 9 months. I will update if I run into problems.
- This machine is causing me to drink less coffee because small amounts come out.
- Note that the regular coffees and espressos have intensity levels and come stronger or weaker. There is a number given on the front of the box. Goes up to 10, I believe (never seen a flavor above 9 though). My favorite is the Americano Veranda from Starbucks, which is a 6 level. The 5 level Medium Roast tastes watery and is a bit too weak for me, so I never put the higher water level for that flavor.... but not bad on the rare occasion that I want a second cup or when I just want weak coffee on some days.
- If you have/buy a glass mug, your coffee really will look as tasty as the product photo!
- Easy to make tea, just turn it on without the coffee pod for hot water-- nice since I go through tea-only phases

CONS
- The machine didn't work when I first bought it. We did an Internet search for reasons why, and in our case, it was related to the water tank/line. We had to fill it with water and put it in place. Then lift it out of place. Then put it back. Then lift it out of place. Then put it back. We had to do this pull it off and on thing maybe 15-20 times (you might have to do more). Apparently the issue had something to do with air pockets in the line and you have to force the water through manually. Who knows. But eventually it started working. After 9 months of use, that was the only time I had to do that. But an instant 3 stars for this first impression alone and the lack of warning.
- Limited choice of pods. You can't use the K-cups in this machine. You have to buy the Dolce Gusto pods. I did find one or two obscure brands that can be used with this machine but they are just as pricey and one choked up my machine so I threw it out.
- Pods are becoming less and less available. I don't know if it's related to the pandemic or what but many flavors are no longer available since I got the machine. And you won't find these offline.
- Pods are ridiculously expensive. Pretty much the same price (OFTEN MORE) as going to one of the big chains.
- Not bad tasting coffee tbh, but not as flavorful as the big chains. I have become a bigger shopper of creamers as a result. Sweet cream with no flavors is the best (personally I love Fairlife Sweet Cream Creamer... less sugar and no weird aftertaste).
- Use a SMALL coffee cup so you won't be disappointed. Most of these pods won't give you the big cup of coffee you may be used to. I had to measure them in a measuring cup because I was so shocked at the small amount it made in my big cup. It was about a cup. The regular coffees like Medium Roast (non-milky) will make more.
- A number of these flavors require TWO PODS. Each will be a different color. But this also means that if you get a box of 16 pods, you're really only getting 8 cups.
- The red cord is an eye sore.
- I have found exactly one DECAF option... and it's double the price of other flavors!
- Check the expiration dates on the pods. One flavor expired after just 2 months of purchase. All the others will expire within a year of purchase (spectrum of 2-11 months for mine-- most 4-6 months).
- AVOID the GRANA CAFE pods which claim to be Nescafe Dolce Gusto Compatible. Read the reviews!! They will damage your machine!! Mine coughed and sputtered and didn't seem to have the pressure needed for the pod. I threw them out as reviewers stated repeated use can damage your machine.

I've decided to use it up until my coffee stash runs out. Then it's going in the garage and I will explore something new. After close to a year with the machine, the pod issues are the biggest negatives at this point."
3,3,별 5개 중 5.0,미국에서 2022년 9월 22일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"I already have an espresso machine, but bought this one to make cappuccinos and macchiatos quickly. The machine is priced fairly, compact, not very fancy (plastic), easy to operate and clean, and makes good coffee. The temp of the coffee is perfect for me. I have to wait a bit to drink it. Some reviews claim the coffee doesn't come out hot enough. That may be the case for those who drink their coffee as soon as it's brewed. I can't handle that level of heat. It burns my tongue. I'm not so sure about the design... You have to slide and hold the knob on the back to one side for a couple of seconds after the coffee starts brewing. If you let go too soon the machine stops and you have to slide it to one side again. Not a deal breaker, but an odd design. To brew cold you slide to one side and hot to the other. I haven't had other people try the cream/coffee pods, but I personally like the flavor of Nescafe blends. My husband likes the medium roast (no cream for him). The cream has a hint a sweetness, but not sweet. I like that. The hot chocolate is okay. So far, very happy and already bought over 100 pods. I haven't tried the cold brews yet. Availability of pods may be an issue since this machine is more popular in Europe and South America. I had to buy 3 to 4 boxes of each, and one mixed pack. If you wanna try one box first, that may be a problem. I have only used the Nescafe pods. I read that you can buy stainless steel pods for this machine but I already have an espresso machine so this one is for convenience and speed."
4,4,별 5개 중 4.0,미국에서 2021년 1월 3일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"Trying desperately to ween myself off of expensive Starbucks habit during Covid, but have no attention span or patience to tamp my own espresso. So many machines on Amazon that I was unable to make a decision and I'm cheap at heart even though I will pay extra for quality when justified. So I decided to give this machine a whirl since the price can't be beaten. Having travelled outside of the US quite extensively, I was aware that Nescafe has more coffee options internationally. The machine is ridiculously easy to use, looks very European and the thick, red cord does not bother me, but totally understand why others may find it a turnoff. All of the coffees and espressos I have tried so far are quite tasty and I find I prefer the Nescafe brands over the Starbucks pods offered. I tried the Nescafe Cappuccino first and the espresso by itself is amazing with hints of dark chocolate. The milk pods are surprisingly good, but I do not like sugar in any coffee drinks period so I would only use the milk pods as a treat rather than everyday use. I rely on my Nespresso Aeroccino3 - highly recommend! - that allows me to steam and froth any milk I desire (mostly lactaid-free non-fat). I do agree with other reviewers that you should stick to the number of bars recommended for the water level/cup size and then add hot water separately if you find the coffee to be too strong. That is the only thing I found frustrating - I want a 12 oz cup every time so you may have to use several pods combined with the desired amount of frothed milk to get to 12 oz. But it's probably no different in the end than having to pay extra for a triple shot in a venti at Starbucks. For sure it is cheaper than having your Starbucks delivered by Uber Eats or - god forbid - having to leave the house to pick up your mobile order, especially when you have no time during the work week. I found some ""Italian Coffee"" brand pods on Amazon that are made in Italy that combine the milk/espresso in a single pod that are very good and by using 1 of those pods + 2 other espresso/coffee pods + adding my own frothed milk, I can create my own delicious lattes and macchiatos. I rated 4 stars for Blending Power based on above, but don't really understand what ""Blending Power"" means otherwise. I totally understand other reviewers' frustration with availability of pods and price increase, but for me since I just got this machine, it's still cheaper and more convenient than Starbucks. My ONLY true complaint is that the pods are NOT recyclable, which sickens me. But I'll stick with this for now and when I need to upgrade/replace will switch to brand that is fully recyclable. Hopefully Nescafe will have this covered by then!"

Yes, the pods are a little expensive, but I got also some compatible silicone pods that can be filled with coffee and used over and over again. When I came back home my Keurig coffeemaker broke and made me very happy, as I went ahead and bought a Dolce Gusto for myself! Cappuccino is my favorite, and I like also the intense espresso."

8,8,별 5개 중 4.0,미국에서 2022년 8월 5일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,I'm originally from the UK and pretty much everyone has one of these (at a much reduced price I might add). I really like the taste of the coffee that has the foamy milk such as the Latte and Cappuccino so I bought one in the US. My main problem is that the price of the pods in the US is twice the price in the UK. That's all !

This is a great lil machine. No need to spend hundreds one others, especially if your like those Italian inspired coffees! Be careful, however, when picking reusable pods. I've bought some duds already. Works excellent with the pre-packaged pods tho!"
10,10,별 5개 중 5.0,미국에서 2022년 5월 12일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"Purchased the machine to replace my German Bought Krups - Nescafé Dolce Gusto Piccolo. Having lived in Germany, I enjoyed the convenience of the machine and the absolutely great coffee it made. Having moved back the USA, I could not find that machine for sale.

I discovered that this machine "" the NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto Coffee Machine, Genio 2, Espresso, Cappuccino and Latte Pod Machine"" was available here in the USA.

-Coffee Maker-
A few remarks. This is a ""commercial coffee maker"". That is made for the ""hospitality industry"" as it says.
It is about the same size as my home machine the ""Krups - Nescafé Dolce Gusto Piccolo"". It is about twice as expensive, but also, it appears, a bit more heavy duty.

It also has more ""bells and whistles"". One nice feature is the ability to adjust the coffee size. That is 12 oz, 10 oz, 8 Oz and all the way down to Espresso size. Lights and a toggle switch show the size of the coffee.

-Automatic-
With this machine, you can pop in your coffee capsule and set the machine and walk away. It will stop automatically.

This being a commercial model, it has a larger water tank. Which means less trips to the faucet to refill.

-Taste-
As far as taste, I just got it and have made 3 cups on two days, so far. Too me, it tastes just like the coffee in Germany that I made on the other Dolce Gusto machine.

Unlike the K-cup machines, this produces a real ""Crema"". The coffee is made at 15 Bar of pressure. Like an Espresso machine. It produces a really nice Crema on the coffee and has a real good taste.

For the price that I paid, around $100 bucks, I think it is a great deal, especially compared to the K-cup machines.

--Suggestion--
Some people apparently complain that they want it the coffee more hot. It seems hot enough to me. I do pre-heat my coffee cups to maintain the warmth and taste.

--Closing Remarks--
This Coffee/Espresso maker is made for the USA with 120 Volts.

The only inconvenient thing, is you can not run to the store and pick up capsules. But Amazon and other major online vendors sell them. If you shop well, you can get the capsules at a cheap price.

The Coffee Machine looks well made, and heavy duty. It is cheaper than the Nespresso machine and most of the Keurig Coffee makers.

This combo Coffee maker and Espresso maker looks to be a great deal. I wish Nestle would focus again on home use. Having said that, if you like European Style coffee with ease of making and great taste, this is the machine."

12,12,별 5개 중 5.0,미국에서 2022년 9월 16일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"I'm on my third Genio (which doesn't look like the one shown...mine has two extra 10/12 oz. options above the usual 7 intensity settings) and I like it in spite of the flaky behavior when trying to use those other seven settings. E.g., when I set mine to, say, five bars for cafe con leche, the last one at the bottom doesn't cycle through, but for the 10/12 oz. choice, it works fine. The coffee gurus at Illy say that a cup should take approx. 30 seconds to brew properly, and so the Genio does pretty well. My ""price-per-cup"" benchmark for even going with Dolce Gusto was once .50$Am. Those days are clearly gone but I shop around for as close to that as I can get for the three-pak pod boxes. My experience with also-rans like Metasa has been that they're poor quality to use and maybe even dangerous (leaky). In ten years of using my Genios I've never had a bonafide Dolce Gusto capsule fail. YGWYPF.... .

An 11/26/21 follow-up: Amazon's got a 40% coupon thing going on the Genio -- but it's not the same model as I bought a year ago with 9 brew settings. It seems to be a throw-back to the original Genio/Piccolo setup with seven settings. So a caveat is in order here. But if you go for it and don't heed the Dolce capsules that call for 9 settings, then no big deal.

If you're replacing an older Genio, keep the water reservoir for the new machine if it doesn't leak."

14,14,별 5개 중 4.0,미국에서 2019년 10월 29일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"My wife and I love this machine. Now, when we originally bought this machine, we were thinking it could replace our regular coffee maker as well. That didn't work out so well. The coffee pods are generally more expensive and from what we found, only available online. We bought some of the reusable pods for traditional coffee. But we had a few problems with those. One, sometimes, even if they are aligned correctly, they can get stuck and you have to really finagle the tray to get it out. Two, sometimes they stream will spray in a skewed direction and miss your coffee cup and make a mess. Three, I found I needed to use two pods to get one cup of coffee to the strength and amount I like.

Now, all that being said, for speciality drinks, we love this machine! Espressos, macchiatos, etc are delicious. We enjoy those on a regular basis. We did finally break down and get a Keurig though for regular coffee drinking.

Finally... the orange cord for the plug is incredibly stupid. It looks like we are doing construction in our kitchen with that thing. Why they couldn't just make it black is beyond me."

Also they claim to have a recycle program so they will send you a box to send back the used pods. But we have been waiting since December for the first box! You can imagine the amount of pods that we collected in this 3 months (approx 4 pods per day is something close to 300 pods). We had submitted two requests trough the website and we also called them to ask for the box. But we have received none. We finally gave up and had to throw them to the trash (what make me sick) but after having keeping them for more than two months they started smelling horrible.
Sadly I’m just switching to another coffee machine brand. I was so excited about this one but unfortunately my first experience with a pod’s one wasn’t a success"

I decided why not since it was a good deal. It arrived with the box a little damaged but I did buy one that had been sent back and it said the box would be damaged. I pulled out the machine and there wasn’t a scratch on it anywhere! We plugged it in and got it set up and it worked beautifully! One of my favorite parts about this machine is that it can do hot or cold coffee!! I much prefer iced coffee but it makes great hot coffee too. I ordered a set of pods that was all in Italian, the Nescafé pods and the Starbucks pods. The Italian ones are ok but are mostly smaller cups or espresso shots. The Starbucks ones are definitely worth it, They taste great! I haven’t got the Nescafé ones yet so I’m not sure how they taste. Yes the power cord is bright red but I don’t mind it. I also love how compact it is! We have a small galley kitchen in our townhouse so there’s not a ton of counter space and this doesn’t take up much at all!! Overall very satisfied with my purchase. Just take the chance! Worst that happens is you don’t like it and send it back!"

I thought es use it for a while and then archive it as usually happens, but we use it every single day several times. I can't rate 'Flavor' here because it only depends on your selection, not in the coffee maker. We love Italian-style coffee and we tried several home coffee makers, but none of them was even close to real espresso or cappuccino. It was a hidden treasure discovering this coffee maker!!! On regards to is size, even that the first impression is it is a toy, it is perfect. It doesn't take significant room in your kitchen and the quality of the coffees is awesome."

Original eventually leaked and couldn’t trace the problem. I think it was the pump. This one has lasted 1 1/2 years. For some reason doesn’t want to pump, not sure why. I opened it up and the tubing and components inside look as if they’re new, no corrosion, no damage, so no idea, maybe pump internals? We have quite a few pods left, so I’ll probably end up getting another to finish them off. Ours is a hard water area, so wondered if this is the root cause, not sure…. Coffees ok, but pods are scarce in some flavors and prices fluctuate widely…. Ce la vie huh?"
20,20,별 5개 중 5.0,미국에서 2022년 3월 6일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"I’ve had this for 6 months now. We use is almost daily. We use the pods that are recommended for it and we buy them off of Amazon. It’s makes great hot coffee, macchiatos, lattes etc. Perfect for our tastes and needs. When we first got it, I couldn’t figure out how to use it. But quickly realized that some people are having issues because they aren’t following the steps in the “right order”. Step 1) push the on button to preheat the machine. This should take all but 30 seconds. Step 2) lift the handle to unlock the pod holder and pull it out. 3) Put the pod in, push it back. 4) use the toggle to set the bars as indicated on the pod itself (push the toggle up and down to set the bars). 5) now push the handle down to lock into place. 6) Push the SAME toggle LEFT for cold and RIGHT for hot.
You’ll hear the machine make noises as it begins to dispense.
7) Repeat with the second pod.
8) remove used pod after done.

Point to note: We only use this for hot beverages. We tried cold and they weren’t cold enough and tasted a bit watered down. So if you’re buying this mainly for cold beverages, try it for yourself before you decide since taste preferences are so varied."

Trouble is, you have to order the pods online as they're not sold in stores. Another issue is that it really makes tiny cups of coffee if you match the bars on the pod with the bars on the machine. So I actually dial in more bars on the machine, and it does make the coffee a little weaker, but at least I get more of it. I can't say whether I'd buy it again because it's a pretty expensive endeavor for a cup of coffee (and more expensive if you drink lots of coffee!). I am considering purchasing one of those reusable pods and using my own coffee, but the reviews didn't look to promising. I wouldn't recommend it for someone on a fixed budget."

Even more so because I have so many sugar free syrup options at home when my favorite coffee shop only has SF vanilla.

They had a cappuccino maker that I fell in love with. This item is a smaller version, but the result is the same. Experiment with the foam versus coffee ratio. I didn’t care for the Caramel macchiato one, myself. It is an inexpensive indulgence!"

I like the Genio 2, but it has taken one tiny step down from the original Genio. Now, unlike the original Genio, you can't set up the machine and push the button for start so that it will begin automatically once the water is hot. Now you have to wait for the water to get hot and then start the machine. You can't walk away and know your coffee will be ready when you walk back."

I had a tassimo in the past and assumed it would be similar and have more flavor than kcup machines. In my opinion, k cups taste great the first month and then quickly go down hill.

In any case, I bought 3 different types of coffee capsules: flat white, Starbucks americano and Nestles Americano.

Turns out the flat white is instant. It’s ok, but instant coffee always tastes like instant coffee. Both Americanos, are pretty tasteless. Surprisingly, the Starbucks brand is much weaker than the Nestles. The Nestles is “fine” at 5 (don’t waste a capsule trying at the recommended 6). I didn’t buy this thing to have “fine” or “ok” coffee. So disappointing, as it’s very easy to use as is a decent temperature.

Maybe it’s just the coffee capsules I bought and I’ll find others with flavor, but Americano should have body and there is no body so I’m not hopeful."

The pods make it so you don't have to sit there and steam milk (which has always required more cleanup in my case.) and the coffee pods come in a variety of flavors. Café style coffee right at home for what equals about $1 a cup instead of $5, Sometimes even $7 at your local Starbucks.

Ordered this new version.....what a MISTAKE. They redesigned the entire thing. The water reservoir is much deeper pushing unit too far out on the counter and does NOT pull out easily. The on/off button is now in the back out of reach. Most offensive redesign is the BRIGHT RED power cord which looks like it should hook up to a generator. Looks ridiculous on the kitchen counter.

I would not have purchased this if I had known my decent flavor options were limited. Maybe I got unlucky with those.

On the plus side, it does make hot drinks fairly quickly and is easy to use. It might become an expensive hot water dispenser in my office though."

We both love the Genio 2. The coffee provided by Nescafe is flavorful and aromatic and, the selections are varied enough for our tastes. Another benefit is the small footprint. This little machine freed up counter space. But, its size may be an issue for some as the water container is also on the small side requiring more frequent fill ups.
Lastly, since the capsules are not widely available you must get them online. This too may be an issue for some.

Probably not the best for everyday use if you drink a lot of coffee: water tank doesn't hold enough water and it is awkward shaped to set correctly on the water intake valve.

Very easy to use and starts up very fast (although a little loud, makes a buzzing pump sound).

You can make your coffee as strong or weak as you like. You can use the same ""flavor"" pod and get 2 different coffee drinks. You can use the strong (less water) setting and make espresso-ish drink with crema coffee foam or use a lighter (more water) setting make coffee....it's versatile to your coffee taste.

Pods are a little expensive but saves me money from buying espresso drinks from coffee shops. There are enough different pod style and flavors out there (not at stores but online) to find what 's right for you.
Pods seem to stay fresh at room temperature for months too.

Only issue I have is the drinks are not hot enough, so I usually pre heat/rinse my cup with hot tap water before. My sister has one also, she had a clogged water dispense nozzle that she cleared with a needle (she believes the water in her area has too much minerals in it).

And I wish that there was some kind of a cleaning brush for the water tank.

360,360,별 5개 중 5.0,미국에서 2022년 9월 16일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"Okay so first of all, I am a huge coffee person. I have several machines at home and I keep a K-cup brewer and Nespresso vertuo machine at work. However, I was interested in finding a machine that could make lattes and cappuccinos using pods instead of steamer wands. So that's when I found the Dulce Gusto.

When I first got this machine, I only had the regular macchiato pods to use. I followed the recommendations for how long to brew each pod, and I have to admit, my initial impression was underwhelming. There just wasn't much flavor at all. I had to add -extra- espresso from my Nespresso machine just to make it taste good. But, before writing the machine off, I decided to order another variety to see if I liked it any better...

What I discovered was two things - first, I noticed the packaging on the other varieties I ordered was different than the macchiato box that I had. Upon close inspection, it seems that the macchiato box may have been counterfeit. It just felt and looked cheaper than the other boxes. Additionally, I had a new macchiato box that came with the variety pack and the packaging was different. So I did a blind taste test to see if I could tell a difference between the two macchiatos - and sure enough, the new box tasted different and better. So.... the poor flavor was not the fault of the machine. It was the pods I was using.

Since then, every pod I have ordered and used tastes great. I have also bought an adapter from Amazon that allows me to use OL Nespresso pods and that works good too. It allows me to have more options than just using Dulce Gusto pods. I also recommend buying extra milk pods so you can mix and match espresso with milk, without having to buy a combination box. There are third party milk pods that are sold here on Amazon and they taste really good, good price too. Just my suggestion. :)

Anyways, yes, this machine is great. Especially now that I have my OL Nespresso adapter. Just make sure when you are ordering pods that you check the reviews because you may wind up with a dud like I did."

392,392,별 5개 중 5.0,미국에서 2022년 1월 24일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"There are so many things I love about this little coffee maker.

First of all it heats up quicker than any other single serving maker I've ever used and I've had quite a few. Less than a minute and it's ready to go.

The machine takes up very little space on the counter top. It's skinny, only about 6 inches wide, the depth is about 10 inches from front to back. Fits perfectly on my small counter top.

It comes with a little container that sits nestled up against the maker when you want to quickly dispose of the pods. Inside the basket is a drip basket above the base so you can remove the pods separately from the liquid, a great no mess touch. It takes a a little more space on the counter but I find it to be very useful and don't always need to keep it there all of the time because it's entirely separate.

Loading the water is super easy, you remove the tank in the back and fill, then slide right back in. ( I had read in some earlier reviews that this was difficult for some people, I have to guess that the company improved the design since then because it's very easy now.)

The variety of coffee offerings is great. I've tried quite a few.
My favorite are some of the two pod varieties. These drinks come with a cream pod and then you discard it and place the darker coffee pod in. Best in this category are: Cappuccino, Latte Macchiato (Vanilla Flavor), and Mocha. The Skinny Cappuccino taste much weaker in flavor but is okay and the regular Latte Macchiato is not to my pleasing.
All of the non cream pod coffee has been very tasty. I enjoy the Dark Roast, Espresso Intenso, Grande Intenso, Medium Roast, and Americano. It all just depends on the mood I'm in, but usually I go for the most powerful darker coffees ( Dark Roast and Espresso Intenso).
Also I like the Cafe Au Lait. This is a single pod drink but has it's own foam that comes from that pod, it's like a light version of the some of the two pod drinks, delicious.

It's a nice feature of the machine to have both hot and cold as an option. I only use the hot because I prefer hot coffee. I tried the cold once and it wasn't that cold, of course you need to add ice to make it a proper cold drink.

If there has to be a con, it's that with so many flavors I like it's very difficult to find storage to hold them all. The pods take up a fair amount of space and it's a little challenging to find a way to keep them organized and at the ready in a smaller kitchen space.

The programing of the intensity of the drink is very easy to use. It lets you decide how much water to coffee ratio you want. The top of the machine has a joystick like lever that you control the green lights of amount of liquid to come into the cup. All of the pods come with directions of how many lights to light up but you can tinker with that to your own pleasing.

Overall I find that the Nescafe machine is a great coffee maker for single serving counter top. I used to use a Keurig before this and although there are more coffee pod options out on the market I feel like they don't taste as good and don't have the options for the foamy cream drinks. Also the super quick warm up time is super key, if your in need of coffee first thing in the morning and need coffee to have energy to make coffee this little machine goes to work almost instantly."

However, I have had no problem acquiring them and have found that the variations of flavors enables me to make more use of this machine than my previous Keurig machine. I have been using this machine daily for 3-4 different beverages and have only once encountered a problem, which I believe was my error. I believe I did not have the pod seated properly with the pod drawer fully closed, which caused the liquid to spray out and miss the cup. Again - I believe this was my error. I appreciate how fast this machine creates whatever beverage I want to make. I brew the standard 12oz coffee as well as hot chocolate, lattes, and cappuccinos. I LOVE LOVE LOVE them all and have a subscription to feed my need :-). I have given the brewed coffee to guests and they immediately went on to purchase their own machine. If you're looking for a good, reliable machine that offers reasonably priced beverages with a good variety of flavors...this is the one to buy.

PROS:
*Super (super) fast! My drinks were ready in a few seconds. The faster I've ever seen.
*Very easy to use. The toggle tool is awesome - all you have to do is toggle left or right for hot or cold.
*Small profile. I have a different brand's cappuccino maker and it is huge and takes up a ton of counter space. This one is so much smaller! It is small enough for desks at work.
*A great variety of coffee pods that are flavored and do not need anything added - no sugar, creamer, or syrup. They taste ready to drink right away.
*Simple instructions for using the pods - even a child could do it.
*I also love the way you can easily change the cup holder to higher or lower levels to avoid splashing coffee.

CONS:
*The cups the fancy drinks make are small - much smaller than a size I would usually drink. You can do a plain coffee in a 12 oz cup though.
*The coffee maker is not tall enough to fit any of my thermal coffee mugs (which makes sense since they don't pour enough coffee for thermal mugs). But, it was disappointing.
*The boxes of pods for the fancy drinks say 16, but that actually means 8 of the espresso part and 8 of the milk part = 8 cups per box.
*It is delicious, but it is not Starbucks."
399,399,별 5개 중 5.0,미국에서 2021년 3월 10일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"My husband and I are big coffee drinkers; we grind beans fresh every morning for our breakfast pot. However, I often start lagging in the late afternoon and crave an extra single cup of coffee. I'm usually too lazy to deal with the mess of prepping another pot, so I jumped at the chance to try out this Genio 2 unit. The simplicity is very attractive; it has honestly exceeded my expectations. For starters, the unit is very compact; my husband didn't want another appliance taking up space in our tight kitchen, and the Genio 2 fits easily in our dining room (it is approximately 12"" height, 6"" wide, 11"" depth). Next, the coffee actually tastes GOOD. The capsule boxes display a chart to guide the water levels, but one can adjust levels for any preference (e.g., the medium and dark roast capsules recommend 12 oz water, but I brew them on 8 oz for stronger flavor). The water heat-up is quick, brew speed is fast, and drink temperatures are hot.

I am impressed with the crema produced on regular coffee brews (note pics); the pressure system on this machine seems to be spot-on. A minor criticism involves the water reservoir; the opening to add water is a semi-circular shape. While it is easy to add water, cleaning it requires a bottle brush because a hand won't fit inside. Another criticism relates to the brewing ounce markers on the front; why are only 10 and 12-oz labeled? There is a sticker that comes with the packaging that shows where 2-, 4-, and 8-oz are; it would be handy to see this on the unit itself. Finally, why is the power cord red? It's not a big deal for me, as I currently have the machine on a table where the cord plugs out of sight. However, if I were to use this in my kitchen, the heavy red cord would be very visible, as my outlets are several inches above my countertops.

Overall, my minor criticisms are are not grievous enough to deduct a star because I am really enjoying this unit. It makes a great cup of regular coffee, it's fun to have occasional fancier drinks like lattes and macchiatos, and my children love the chococino hot chocolate. It's also handy for making quick drinks for guests."

It died after two years and we moved on to Kuerig and then a very, very expensive super automatic espresso machine that I've loved for the last two years. My husband gets easily aggravated by the espresso machine and I dislike most of the Kcup coffees. So trying this new generation Dolce Gusto was a no brainer.

This machine is very quiet - significantly less noisy than the espresso machine grinding beans at 7am and quieter than the Kuerig even. This Genio also takes half the counter space of either of the other two machines. My husband appreciates the simplicity of the Genio - just pop in the pod, adjust the toggle to the strength you want and press start. It's exactly that simple for both black coffee and cappuccino or an iced mocha. The milk pods froth and foam very nicely.

We have tried six different coffee versions so far and I have to say that I had forgotten how good the Dolce Gusto coffees really are. There has been absolutely no bitterness or aftertaste or oily residue from any one of them at all. My husband really likes the plain Americano and Intenso black coffees.

I'm particularly fond of the simple cappuccino, vanilla latte machiatto and the cafe aulait. The caramel latte is a shade too sweet for me, but my mother loves it. However, the one thing every one of us is crazy about is the mocha over ice. Fill a regular plastic cup with crushed ice and a straw, set the machine for 12 ounces, add a bit of sugar to taste, and brew the hot water option. It's like a chocolate milk shake, just not as thick. Makes a great after dinner, sitting on the porch with the dogs, desert coffee."

 This is what I’ve been looking for...I used to LOVE using a Tassimo machine that was similar to this but the Tassimo stopped having coffee readily available and it was a huge bummer. This machine definitely picks up where that left off years ago and is WAY more economical for lattes, cappuccino, espresso, etc, than any machine I’ve used before. Also, the milk pods are a sort of powdered version but I cannot tell at all when enjoying morning coffee. This Dolce Gusto is simple to use, has a great reservoir size and while it has somewhat different directions than I’m used to, it gives me the ability to ramp up or ramp down either coffee or milk. Essentially, the bars is how much of each you are wanting to make and the pictures on the top of the pods correlate to the amount for each. I learned to tweak the amount of coffee and milk and it has produced some outstanding results and placed me firmly into coffee bliss.

Coffee:

This has a LOT of coffee types available. I know there is at least 13 kinds, not counting dessert drinks. Lattes, cappuccino, macchiato, espresso, Americano, to name a few. There is also a decaf version. Basically, I’m loving the options.

Pros:

Works very well

Brews a mean espresso, latte, macchiato, Americano

Milk is powdered but keeps way longer

Pods are economical (opinion)

Gives ability to tailor the amount of mil/espresso as desired (isn’t in the directions, however)

Heats up way faster than my Keurig

Does hot and cold

Cons:

Can’t run just water unless you use the clear adapter (no issues but the adapter looks like packing material)

I’ve not seen pods for it in a lot of stores (so here is probably the best place to get them)

Overall, this has usurped my Keurig and Nespresso for my morning wake up routine."

As I was making his cup I really liked how good it smelled so I decided to take a sip. Well that sip led to another and then another and suddenly I'm hooked and there are so many different flavors available that I'm not sure if I'll ever get to all of them. I know some might think that the coffee pods are too expensive but that can not be further from the truth. These come out to be around $.70 per pod. And, with the pods, the coffee will be the exact amount and strength you want every time. On each pod there is a picture of a bar level. All that has to be done is to match the bars on the pod lid to the machine and then choose whether you want it hot or cold. Now the bar levels act as a template so it gives a pretty good estimate as to what that particular flavor should be brewed at but you can certainly adjust the bar level to whatever you want. The flavors that have those yummy creamy foams will be just as perfect as if you were getting it from one of those expensive coffee houses. I know all this bar stuff sounds confusing but once you purchase this and read the instructions it will be so easy to understand. The instruction manual is very detailed and easy to follow. It takes no time at all to brew a cup so no more waiting for that regular old coffee maker to get done. This is shaped like one of those bullet blenders so it doesn't take up much counter space. For all that this machine can do, it is worth every penny. And again, I have to say this, the coffee that comes out of this no matter if it's dark roast, cappuccino, or one of the many other flavors, it will taste utterly flawless!"

For one, while it is definitely a substantial piece of equipment it is not Mongo. I hate Mongo appliances as they take up way more space than they should and in doing so make themselves completely annoying when not in use.
Second, it looks cool. When I described it to someone as looking like Atom Ant that person began to laugh, but it really does look like a 21st century Atom Ant.
Third, it is stupidly easy to operate. In fact, it is so stupidly easy to operate that even the sometimes stupid instructions don't really matter (more on that later).
Fourth, the stuff it makes really does mostly look exactly like the pictures and you know that never happens.
Fifth, it makes NO MESS (but it do create lots of waste).
Don't be fooled, however, because this machine is by no means perfect. Yes it looks cool, yes it is a breeze to set up and use, yes it makes stuff almost exactly like the pictures and yes it leaves the surrounding area as clean as it was when you got the thing out BUT I don't believe this machine can ever get beyond its use of powdered milk for the milk in its milk-based products, because every one I have tried except for the Chai latte flavor, which I bought extra, has the artificial flavor characteristic of powdered milk coming through which kind of ruins the drinks for me. Oddly when I tasted just the milk component of the Chai tea latte drink I swear it tasted just like frothed or foamed milk.
I also bought the Chococino flavor cups for this machine because I drink cocoa nearly every day, and it isn't bad but it does have an aftertaste that I don't cotton to, and it lacks that fatty, creamy flavor that a really good cocoa made with whole milk has.
As to pure coffee drinks, this machine does an excellent job of making them but, again, the flavor produced is merely excellent capsule coffee. Is it better capsule coffee than I've tasted from any of the Keurig-type cups I've tasted? Yes! Definitely!! Actually, there is no comparison. This stuff is hands down better than anything that comes from one of those machines.
Is it as good as a straight up coffee you can brew yourself? Probably not, except that most people don't brew high end coffee and almost nobody makes stove top espresso, so it really comes down to whether you already make excellent coffee for yourself which you probably don't and if you don't live in the pacific northwest in which case you probably can't get very good coffee anyways (and no starbucks isn't a place you go to get good coffee, good coffee drinks...maybe, but not good coffee).
Yes this review is coming from the pacific northwest which is a place where good coffee is just taken for granted and there really just is a lot of good brewed coffee and concoctions readily available out here. Having said that, this is The machine to go with even if, or especially if, you live in a place where excellent coffee is readily available But you MUST have an instant coffee machine.
I hoped this would be an opportunity to stop spending four dollars on a Chai and between two and three dollars for hot cocoa as I do every day (until recently Mcdonalds offered a really excellent hot chocolate for just two dollars but something changed about a year ago and now it doesn't taste so good) but I don't care for either the chococino or the chai tea latte enough to stop buying the coffee shop chai and chocolate I already do.
Having said that, through experimentation have discovered that making the Chococino along with either a Luongo or the Espresso does make a really good Mocha (3 total capulses). Likewise, doubling up a Mocha and a Chococino makes a good brew as well (4 total capsules). I still have not figured out how to make the Chai latte 'wetter' which would make it a far better drink, in my opinion. Also, one can experiment with using fluid levels different than those called for on the capsules to customize the flow and improve or tweak the end result.
If I lived pretty much anywhere else I could be happy drinking the Chai and the enhanced Mochas this machine makes. As to the other flavors, the artificial flavor is kind of a deal killer for me but the non-flavored drinks are pretty good; as good as the coffee regularly served in all the cafes in Amsterdam, for instance, which is probably exactly what Nestle had in mind with this machine as I notice that there are larger versions of this contraption that are meant to be used semi-commercially.
I have no idea what use the cold setting is. I have tried to use it and it just produces what looks like dish water with weak coffee flavor.
Also, it would be convenient if the water reservoir could be topped or filled without having to remove it entirely from the machine and the machine can't sense when there is not enough water to complete the brewing cycle it just brews until it runs out of water and then starts flashing red, so keep an eye on water levels.
The instructions, if there were any, aren't great but once you have the pictographs figured out you realize it is no big deal anyway.
Anybody who hates all of the trash and waste created by our First World lives will also feel slightly appalled by the mounting pile of plastic waste as one brews just three or four coffee drinks for company, because each drink requires the use of two pods..only the straight coffees require just one, and as if that wasn't too much already these aren't flimsy light weight pods either.
I can't really recommend this machine but I do kind of encourage you to get one if you were thinking you might, expecially if you live in Wyoming or Arkansas. I know that doesn't make a whole lot of sense but this is why this machine rates four stars all day but can never be a five!"

I got to say it makes some good coffee but the really impressive aspect is the variety of drinks you can make with this device. Everything from a standard cup of coffee to a chai tea latte. The versatility of drinks is what makes this a winner.

When you first open this appliance it's got a very odd look/shape. I like it because it’s different and almost futuristic looking. They did well with making it match the modern stainless steel kitchens that have become common now. The one odd thing is the cord is bright red. It just seems weird but not a big deal if you tuck it away out of view.

I’ve tried a number of drinks. The more regular coffee to me is a notch above some of the older single-serve machines but still not overly impressive. The other drinks this makes are really good. Such as the lattes or the specialty coffee drinks. The one catch to any of the single-serve machines is that the pods are pricey. For me, if you are using this instead of getting your morning coffee from a coffee shop then I could see this being a huge cost saver. The device itself is priced very well and actually much cheaper than other single-serve machines/brands. So the initial expense is well worth it for the device.

Overall I really love the machine. It makes a wide variety of drinks that typically would difficult to make at home. It’s an expensive solution for more fancy drinks. I’m hooked and I’ll be ordering more of the pods because I use it instead of paying for a morning Starbucks latte. Not to mention it saves time as I’m rushing to get to work."

It takes much more effort than I am comfortable with as you have to use a lot of pressure to get it out. I was afraid I was going to break it.

The directions are clear and include words as well as pictures. The machine is simple to use and the results are uniformly excellent. You must use their pods; as far as I know, there is no reusable pod or alternative. It is easy to impress your friends with fancy cappuccinos and the like. Simple, delicious and fast. The machine is not too noisy. You can make cold as well as hot beverages with it.

to the extent I have a quibble it is with the water tank. You must remove it to refill and replace it. The back is also open. It wishes there was a way to fill it while in position and I also wish it has a cover over the open part. But that is definitely not a deal-breaker. I am a caffeine fiend and am thrilled with this machine's performance. Plus there is a good selection of pods so when the mood strikes I can easily make a fancy barista style beverage."
416,416,별 5개 중 3.0,미국에서 2021년 10월 3일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"This is a mixed review.

Out of the box I followed the directions exactly but couldn't get it to work. There was power and I could hear the pump running but no water flow. I called Nescafe support and they asked ""did you prime it first?"" There was nothing about that in the directions and no obvious button or knob for priming. They told me I needed to lift and lower the water tank with increasing force, which I did 200 times. Still no water flow, at which point they said to call Amazon and arrange for a return.

I told them I thought that was terrible customer service. This wasn't an inexpensive item and there was a quality control issue if it could leave the factory not working. Ideally they'd send out a new machine and a free return shipping label for the nonworking one. At minimum you'd think they'd offer a box of coffee pods or something for the inconvenience.

After hanging up I kept playing with it figuring I had nothing to lose. I removed the needle from a meat injector and filled it with water. I then used that to try and force out any air in the machine. After about a dozen tries and water everywhere I got it to work. So for quality control they get a 0. For customer service I'll give a generous one star for answering the phone and sounding pleasant even if unhekpful.

Now the good part. Once I got it to work this machine makes great coffee. It puts every drop machine and Keurig I've owned to shame. And each cup is every bit as good as I get at the local coffee house at a fraction of the cost. It's stylish and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. I just wish it worked out of the box.

Ive used both the Nescafe capsules and a refillable DGPod I also purchased here on Amazon. I have to say the reusable pod is great and something i'd highly recommend as an accessory."

I tried different Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee pods which are unique to this machine and I like most of them. The coffee tastes little creamy and I also found a reusable pod on Amazon. Too early to tell how good is the reusable pod is but I understand the coffee needs to be ground very fine like Espresso if you want to use the reusable pods. The only disadvantage if you can't use the reusable pods is that these pods are not readily available. You can only buy on Amazon though they say they are also available at Staple's.

The pods show you how many bars to set for each different one, so there's no guess work involved. Even tells you how many ounces the end result will be so you can size your cup or mug accordingly. The overall size of the machine is significantly smaller than a Keurig, so you need less counter space or it can easily be stored in a cupboard and brought out whenever you need it. I was extremely impressed with the quickness of the heating cycle, much faster than any other machine I've used. As for the end result....really really good! I've always felt that you have to trade taste for the convenience of any coffee or espresso machine such as this. That's absolutely not the case here though.

The machine looks like a little penguin on my countertop, or maybe a coffee butler. You select your pod(s), make sure there’s enough water in the back, adjust your drip tray height, put in the selected pod and lock it in place, toggle to the desired water level, flip the lever to hot or cold, and watch your coffee being made!
If you are having a drink that requires two pods, the instructions will show which one to insert first. It is usually the lighter colored pod.

You can mix and match to create your own custom drinks! I got the bundle with the assortment of coffee pods and it has been fun trying the different flavors. Add a little cinnamon if you like. This is a great for entertaining because guests are able to select their personal favorite flavors, and they aren’t restricted to the one or two pots you might otherwise brew.

I decided to try the Dolce Gusto, and I really like it. It's really easy to use, and has a good variety of capsules. And cleanup? Not very much. It comes with a canister to dump the used capsules in, and I empty and clean it once a week.

I've still got a pot brewer for when we're entertaining and need more than a cup at a time. But the Dolce Gusto is my every day brewer."

I personally believe so far this is the best machine I ever had, the quality of the coffee is amazing, I'm half Italian and half Venezuelan so I'm very picky with my coffee, but with this machine you can easily do Espresso, Cappuccinos etc in less than a minute and have a great taste!...

I have tea pods that I've used in this and it seems to have worked just splendidly. So now we have hot tea whenever. Another perk when the mother in law comes for a visit she does drink coffee so this is great I just go get the coffee pods for her when shes here. Now I wont be wasting money on purchasing bags of coffee that goes stale within two to four weeks. She lives out of state so if she doesn't take it with her again it then becomes waste. This is the perfect resolution for us when we have family in from out of state who drink coffee. Cleaning I just run distilled white vinegar through it to keep everything nice and clean.

The Nescafe medium roast had a bitter taste to me probably because I normally drink Nespresso with heavy cream. I tried the Medium Roast, the Skinny Cappucino and the Latte Macchiato and did not like any of them. I think the powdered milk gives it an off taste as well. I am picky about my coffee. I can't drink coffee from McDonald's either.

One problem I encountered is when you are done using the machine, the pods are full of water and I thought I had done something wrong. I emailed the company but never heard back from them.

Lastly, the sweet drinks are too sweet for me. It's a cool concept but I never thought about not being able to sweeten it to my taste. I like Cafe Vienna from Maxwell House but I did not like these.

The sweet drinks use two pods. One is a powdered milk and the other coffee. The sugar and flavorings is in one of them."

454,454,별 5개 중 1.0,미국에서 2020년 12월 7일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"Update!!
This stopped working after a few month!! It won’t even turn on. I’ve tried everything. I called the maker and of course “a supervisor will call you back” but nothing.... It’s been 8 weeks. I’m sitting on 20 boxes of coffee that I can’t use. I was so excited about this too. It’s really disappointing. Poor machine quality and customer service. I went and bought a new Keurig with iced coffee function. It’s great to be back after all. Bye Dolce Gusto 👋

I’m so happy to have this new coffee maker!! I was tired of the same old Keurig pods and wanted a change. Wow! There are so many flavors to choose from for this, so
you can cater to the whole house and their individual preferences! From caramel and vanilla macchiato, dark expresso, medium roast, skinny cappuccino, mocha, etc. each mixed drink comes with a milk pod AND a coffee pod. The directions are on the box and it’s a picture so anyone can follow it. The machine itself is super easy to set up and use. Fill the tank up the max line, attach to the back of the machine, plug it in. Turn it on and use the joystick on the back to increase the markings indicating the number of ounces to brew. I usually do 10-12. Then I slide the pod in, pull the chrome handle down to close and push the joystick to the right for hot. (To the left is for cold coffee). When done, I pull the coffee pod out, put the White pod in the holder, slide it in, pull the chrome handle down again, adjust the joystick to show around 4 green lines and then push it to the right for hot milk and add it to the same mug, add my splenda and I’m good to go. I enjoy the various flavors and the taste of having brewed, frothy, flavored milk! No need for creamer anymore with the flavored drinks. This takes up a fraction of the space my Keurig does. It’s cute, compact and easy to operate. It’s neater too, since the pods pop out and go easily into the side disposable compartment that’s included. I think I’ve officially been converted away from long time friend, the Keurig! Try it! You won’t be disappointed. It’s like having high end, cafe’ specialty drinks every time, at a fraction of the cost of Starbucks."

I am sitting on a $200 paper weight with 100 coffee pods that doesn't work with anything else. Support is horrible. Product doesn't last. Sorry, I liked it for the 3 months it worked. I have an $800 Jura super automatic that has brewed over 12000 cups of coffee, and provided probably about 6000 cups of hot water for tea, for the past 13 years.

The Nespresso makes better coffee, but not by much. This item unfortunately reminds me of the competition to Soda Stream, despite it being name brand competition, the product was largely unsupported, and may now be obsolete. Maybe this coffee pod maker with proprietary pods you can only get on Amazon, is sold in Europe or Asia to a wider audience, but I've Never even seen a print or TV add for it in the USA. I looked so see if you could get those cheater pods for this one that you could fill on your own, but couldn't find them. While I'm sure it makes good coffee based on the pressure used in the machine, and some of the other reviews. I wouldn't even want it for the tax value through the VINE since chances are it will be off the market in a few years.

I do have a suggestion for the maker, since they seem to know something about pressure and heat in making good coffee. I suggest maybe give this a dual selectable feed, the pod area if it took both Keurig style, and the proprietary pods so people would not have a paperweight when the other pods are no longer supported, or are too overpriced to use. The single cup machines are for busy people who also like variety. Flexibility is the key, and if you make it hard to get pods at only one location, then I'd rather have a Keurig. Not recommended in it's current form. Note you don't see any testing here cause I never ordered this, but I do have experience with products that go obsolete the moment you buy them, and I suspect this of having that potential."

508,508,별 5개 중 1.0,미국에서 2021년 4월 30일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"I really wanted to like this product, as I like the Nescafe coffee capsules (Dark, Medium, Americano, etc) way better than any K-cup I've ever tried, and I like being able to have a 10-12 ounce mug-full. I wanted to love the Chai Tea Latte, the Mocha, the various flavored coffee macchiato lattes, and the other combos that utilized a milk capsule, but I found it impossible to love or like, or even accept, those capsules.

And, you should know, I approached this Genio 2 with open arms and an open mind, because I really want my Chai Tea Lattes back that I used to get from a Tassimo machine, almost two decades ago now. When the Tassimo went out, I switched and bought a few Nespresso machines. (I've reviewed quite a few of the Nespresso machines since then.....) But Nespresso does not do tea, and our family does not really like the Nespresso machine that does large cups of coffee. I really wanted this machine: For quick and easy Chai tea lattes and large cups of coffee. I gave this a one-star rating: That does not mean I'm mad. It means I'm terribly disappointed.

Two major issues--and maybe one stems from the other: The capsules leak--aggressively leak--when trying to remove them from the machine. Also, the combo milk/coffee or tea capsules make extraordinarily weak and/or small portions. The capsules leak so much that I better have a dish cloth held underneath the capsule as I remove it from the machine. If I don't have cloth right there, scalding fluid leaves a trail that is messy and a bit dangerous. Dare not use a cupped hand to catch the drips--liquid is too hot and you'll get burned.

I realized the just-coffee capsules don't leak as much as the capsules that create the specialty drinks. Why is that? So, I started cutting open the capsules to see what was going on inside. I took my observations to the guys at the Nescafe Dolce Gusto toll-free number shown on the included instructions. (I spoke with three of them, on separate calls, before asking to speak with a supervisor. I never got to talk to a supervisor.) They told me that I should expect there to be liquid left over in the capsule after the pour. Which leads us to believe that the liquid would drip out of the holes in the top and bottom of the capsules. (Okay, but I don't have this problem with K-cups in Kuerig machines......)

I mentioned to these very polite Nescafe customer representatives that I measured the amount of liquid left in the capsules after the pour. All milk capsules--which contain only dissolvable powder--contained over 1.25 ounces of watery, (but fairly flavorful and important to the final result I think), liquid after the pour. That's a lot! Go ahead and measure out that amount to see what it means to a short cup of latte! Mocha capsules contained the same unbelievable amount of liquid after the pour. No wonder the stuff was leaking out! Coffee capsules--which contain coffee grounds wrapped in a sort of cellophane pillow--were not able to hold so much liquid after the pour. Some capsules that made short coffees contained a little less than an ounce of liquid. Capsules for larger coffees, with larger pillows of coffee grounds inside, only contained a few teaspoons of liquid after a pour. All of it still wanted to leak out.....

Is this a pressure problem with my particular machine? The last of the liquid not being forced out? Or, is this part of the design of the machine--like the customer service reps told me? I don't know, but I won't be buying another three-pack of the Chai Tea Latte, nor the three pack of the Dark Roast for my husband.

Putting aside the leaking problem, I'd like to comment on a few things:

The machine is very easy to use. Contrary to many reviews I've seen here, the machine is intuitively easy to run. The capsule tops, and the boxes the capsules come in, advise the user of the suggested defaults for strength. They have transcribed strength into bars that show ounces of water used to make the pour. The user can easily adjust the bars to raise or lower the strength. For instance, when pouring a dark roast, my husband sets the bars to 12 ounces and I set the bars to 10 ounces.

If there is milk involved, you use two capsules for each drink. That means the box of capsules will include, say, 16 capsules, but will only make 8 drinks. The milk capsules are filled with dry powdered milk (and possibly some sugar and flavor and maybe a foaming agent?). Some milk drinks suggest using 5 bars, some use 2 or 3 or 4 bars. I've not been able to find a nice balance, and I've not been happy with any of the defaults: It's either way too weak, or too intense a powdered milk flavor and sweet. (Starbucks is making some awfully good flavored creamers lately......Seems so much easier and personally manageable.)

The machine has a nice, tight footprint. It is kinda' cute. BUT IT HAS A BRIGHT RED CORD. I hate the cord color. I want all my kitchen cords to recede into the background. This red cord tells me how important it is every day. I know, but it does not have to keep reminding me!

The bulky size and boxy, over-sized, square, shape of the boxes of capsules is an annoyance that cannot be ignored and should be considered. The capsules are not nicely stacked in a nice, tight space. They are jumbled in a square box that takes up a lot of room. It is an issue that nobody really considers when first buying a machine, as your brain concentrates on finding a good-tasting brew. But over time, the way Nescafe boxes their product becomes a major space problem.

The flavor of some of the capsules that I have tried:
--Dark Roast makes a fine cup of coffee at 10 or 12 ounces.
--Medium Roast is my favorite for sipping alongside a nice breakfast. It is great with a touch of cream.
--Espresso. What can I say, except: If you want espresso, get a Nespresso.
--Americano is an average cup of coffee. Aren't all Americano's sort of middle of the road?
--Mocha--even though it's a bit weak--is wonderful.
--Chai Tea is pitifully weak, no matter how few bars I use.
--Vanilla Latte Macchiato is not worth the effort.
--Caramel Latte Macchiato is a bit weak, but still good.

Bottom line: There is still no machine that I've tried that will give me a nice, decent-sized, potent chai tea latte. This machine is not the answer. But if you want a small and easy machine to give you flavorful, larger (10-12 ounce) cups of plain, dark and medium roast coffee, this is a decent machine--just put up with the excessive drips. If you want specialty, small coffee and milk creations, buy a Nespresso machine. If you want just espresso, there are so many choices, buy anything BUT this machine."

548,548,별 5개 중 5.0,미국에서 2020년 12월 6일에 검토됨,스타일: Genio 2,"I bought this to replace a Dolce Gusto Circolo that gave up the ghost after more than five years of solid use at home. I was debating between this one and the Esperta 2, as well as the top-of-the-line Majesto. I originally thought I'd splurge and go for the Majesto which would be a logical replacement for my Circolo, but then I thought better of it and decided to just go with this Genio 2 for a number of reasons:

1. I expected it to make the same great-tasting coffee as the more expensive model; same pods, same bars of pressure, etc. And the answer is: Yes, the coffee tastes just as good as with my old Circolo, so I would bet it would taste the same as the Majesto brewed coffee too. In fact, this one makes it hotter than my Circolo did, so it lasts hot/warm longer, and maybe it's my imagination but it seems to also make a thicker crema for an even tastier treat.

2. The water receptacle is BIGGER than my old Circolo. Maybe not as big as the more expensive models, but large enough capacity that I don't have to refill it too often. It's probably not a good idea to let the water sit for a long time in the receptacle anyway because the water may get a little ""stale"". So 45 ounce capacity is ideal, and you really don't need the larger 60 ounces for a couple of reasons, one of which being the stagnation of too much water sitting around, and the other reason being the following point....

3. This has a smaller footprint than the other more expensive models with the slightly larger water receptacles, so it takes up half the counter space as my old Circolo. My wife is happy too because the kitchen counter looks neater too.

4. It's not as ""digital"" so I hope it lasts longer than the more expensive models because this one has less software related things that can break or cause problems.

5. It has a red cord. So what?! I notice a lot of people make an issue of it and even downgrade it for this. Why? If you know you're not going to like the red cord then don't buy it, and definitely don't buy it then write up a review with a downgrade for the cord color. Move on to something else and don't knock this great coffee maker. Or wrap the red cord in black electrical tape if that's your preference. In any case, if the coffee maker is against the wall or in a corner of your kitchen somewhere then the cord won't be noticeable anyway.

6. Finally, I was also considering buying one of Nespresso machines to try something new. I've had their coffee too and it tastes really good. However, I decided to stick with Dolce Gusto because:
- I already have a lot of coffee pods that I really like. Not a primary consideration for sticking with this form factor because my brother has a Dolce Gusto and I would have given him all of my pods, but this leads to my next point....
- Dolce Gusto makes what I consider to be amazing pods that you can't find for any other machine, such as the Cortado Decaf (my favorite of all of them), plus the various teas and fancy drinks my wife and daughter like, etc.
- There are still plenty of places to buy Dolce Gusto pods online, such as Amazon, Ebay, and a few other sellers.
- Dolce Gusto pods cost half as much as Nespresso. No reason to pay more for delicious tasting coffee.

It's a great machine that's easy to use; takes up little kitchen counter space; and if experience serves as an example as it has in my case, it should give you many years of service. And it's also cheap enough that if one day I get tired of it I can just toss it and buy something else, like one of the Nespresso machines.

Good luck with your decision!"
