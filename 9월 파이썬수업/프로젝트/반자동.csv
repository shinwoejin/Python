0,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Despite some of the negative criticism sprinkled throughout this review, keep in mind that (1) I am giving this machine 5 stars, and now that I have spent a few weeks getting to know it (intimately), I love it - so much, that if a burglar broke into my house and stole it, I would order another one the same day - I have not been back to Starbucks since. All that being said, you NEED to read this review so that your machine does not frustrate you and so that you get the most out of it. Read on my coffee-loving friend:

1. I am a guy, who knew nothing about espresso machines before this. I am very mechanically inclined and don't usually read instructions. This was different - this machine is NOT self-explanatory and you NEED to read the instructions (which are well written, and even include a troubleshooting section). Don't get frustrated with this machine until/unless you have read (all) the instructions.

2. This is not a 'stand-alone' purchase ... this machine costs around $500 (give or take), you need to invest another $100 right from the start (preferably at the same time) to get the most out of it, enjoy it to the fullest, and not get unreasonably frustrated by making your own lattes and mochas.

3. The other things you REALLY should order at the same time (and all are available on Amazon) are:
a. ($29) 100-pack disposable 20oz. cups with lids and sleeves (sold by Yes!fresh). Trust me, you want to get these. It's only $0.29 per cup and are far more convenient that trying to clean out a million dirty coffee cups from your car/office each week. These are worth twice what they cost in the long run. And when your friends are over, you need not 'loan' them a nice coffee cup to go (which you may never see again) - just give them a paper cup to take with them.
b. ($5-15 for 25 oz. / $20-30 for 64 oz.) Torani syrups and sauces, AND the pump tops that go with them (always sold separately). IF you drink the same thing on a regular basis (like I do) such as a white chocolate peppermint mocha, buy the 64 oz. white chocolate sauce and not the smaller 25 oz. bottle.
c. ($14) Amazon Basics Cotton Washcloth - 24 pack - grey (the grey matches the espresso machine, but the color doesn't matter). Again, trust me, you want a nicely folded stack of these sitting next to the machine - you will use 1 each time you make espresso, and then it will be dirty and needs to be washed. At my house (3 people using the machine) we bought two 24-packs because we make so much coffee - two 24-packs is not too many for our house (I'm thinking about buying a third pack).
d. ($10 for pair of single shot size, $15 for pair of double shot size) Set of double-walled espresso shot glasses. Do NOT buy the rounded ones (ie: Cutehom espresso coffee cups) because they will not pour very well and drip all over the place (down the side) each time - very frustrating. Buy the JoyJolt Javaah Double Walled Espresso Glasses instead - you'll be glad you did in the long run. And, if you're planning to make mostly double-shot lattes/mochas, buy a set of Dragon Glassware 6 oz Espresso Cups (also double-walled) so that you don't have to keep fidgeting with the single shot cups to keep them in the right spot under the coffee dispenser. It's important to buy double-walled glasses for two reasons. First, it keeps the espresso hot while you're steaming your milk, second, it keeps you from burning your fingers when pouring the espresso into your coffee cup.
e. ($15) Breville BCB100 Barista-Style Coffee Knock Box. Again, TRUST me, you want this right next to your machine - the coffee grounds will start piling up quickly and you don't want your portafilter anywhere near a garbage can. This thing is a must.

4. Space requirements: This machine (and all that you want to go with it) will take some counter space - allow AT LEAST 34-inches of counter width to accommodate - slightly more is even better. You will from my picture, this is a 34-inch setup, and there is no room to spare.

5. Making espresso. After you read the instructions, here are some tips that they don't include to help avoid frustration:
a. When the beans are grinding, lightly knock on the top of the hopper lid (just like knocking on a door) so that the beans keep feeding down to the grinder (sometimes they get hung up - a light knock each time keeps this from happening). Do NOT overfill the portafilter (after tamping) or it will jam coffee grounds into the water outlet and could possibly damage the portafilter or locking guide. After the grounds are tamped down in the filter cup, the silver part of the tamper should be just hidden beneath the rim of the portafilter (the machine includes a tool you can use if you accidentally overfill the filter cup, but after a short while, you'll figure out how much to grind each time and the tool will not be necessary).
b. You ALWAYS want to watch the pressure gauge when making espresso. It NEEDS to be in the dark grey area of the pressure gauge (and ideally in/near the middle of the grey area) during the brew cycle, otherwise you are not making good espresso - rather, you are making either watered down espresso (not enough pressure) or not enough espresso which is too rich (too much pressure). There are two key things that affect pressure: the fineness at which the coffee is ground (which is adjustable) and the volume of grounds in the portafilter (also adjustable). Although there is a one or two shot size setting, I have found it best to do two, 1-shot grinds, tamping down the grounds in-between each single-shot grind. I have the grind (volume) setting on the 4th click setting, and I have the grind (fineness) setting on either 2 or 3 (play around and see what gives you the best results). IF the pressure is too low, then either your coffee is ground too coarsely, or your have not tamped it down tight enough, or the filter is not filled with enough coffee grounds, or a combination of any/all of these things. IF the pressure is too high, then either your coffee is ground too finely, or you have tamped down the grounds too hard (tightly), or a combination of the two.
c. IF using two, single-shot espresso glasses to collect a double-shot brew, keep an eye on them during the brew cycle and make sure they are centered under the espresso being dispensed (this can be avoided by using a double-shot size collection cup).
d. IF making a mocha or other syrup/sauce drink, pre-mix the espresso and syrup in the glass and stir thoroughly before adding the steamed milk.
e. Steaming milk is 1/2-art, and 1/2-science (seriously), and it does not come naturally. If you've never worked at a coffee shop and been trained to steam milk, do yourself a favor and watch a few good (short) YouTube videos on the proper way to steam milk. You will THANK yourself for taking 5-10 minutes on You Tube and learning the proper way to steam milk (and things to avoid). Understanding the steaming process will allow you to control the amount of foam on top and not make big mess.
f. Before you steam your milk, VENT the steam wand to remove the residual water from the boiler line (you don't want a few teaspoons of water in your milk). Vent the line, then turn the steam off ... wait 5 full seconds ... then insert the steam wand into the milk, then turn the steam back on. Hold the handle with your left hand, and place your right hand underneath the stainless steel milk steaming cup, when the cup is too hot for your right hand to touch (I mean really to hot to hold), keep the steam wand in and start counting along with the pump (which sounds like a metronome in the background ... dit ... dit ... dit ... dit ...). For a semi-hot latte/mocha keep the steam wand in the milk for 30 double-dits (don't start counting until after you can non longer touch the bottom with your right hand ... ""and-one, and two, and three"" and so on until you get to 30 (the equivalent of 60 single dits). For hot (but still drinkable) count to 40 double-dits, and for very-hot, 50 double-dits. Anything above 60 and you risk burning the milk (which will ruin the flavor and you will need to toss it out and start over). When finished, turn the steam off, and remove the steam wand from the milk about 3-5 seconds before it finishes blowing steam (to avoid having milk sucked back up into the steam line).
g. After you steam your milk, VENT the steam wand again to remove any milk that inadvertently got sucked up into the steam wand line and prevent any from making its way into the boiler. IF milk makes its way back into the boiler unit (because you failed to vent the line after use) you will DESTROY the boiler (permanently), in that, the milk cannot be cleaned out, will burn during the next use, and every cup of milk you steam in the future will have a burnt-milk smell/flavor - yuck! DO yourself a favor and vent the steam line religiously after each use - and make sure others who use your machine know that they can ruin it if they don't do so also! (there goes $500!)
h. The bottom tray is easy to remove, empty and clean (comes apart in 3 pieces). You should empty this every 2-4 days of use because it fills up despite you not pouring liquid into it - reason is, each time you finish using the steam wand or hot water dispenser, the machine auto-vents out the line from the boiler into the bottom tray (sneaky little devil) ... so even though you don't realize it, it's filling up a little with each use. (Fun fact - the hot water dispenser can be used for instant hot water to make tea!).

6. Cleaning up.
a. I unfold a clean washcloth each time I make espresso. When you tamp down the grounds, it will help avoid damaging/scratching your counter, and will catch the spill-over grounds (there will always be some spill-over).
b. When finished, use hot water (from your kitchen sink) to rinse the espresso cup(s), milk steaming cup, portafilter and filter insert (remove the filter cup from the portafilter each time you clean them), then use another clean washcloth to set them out to dry upon.
c. The washcloth used to make espresso: fold it in half, twice (into a square), and use the hot water dispenser (on the machine) to get one corner of the square wet with hot (boiling hot) water, then fold the square into a triangle so that the boiling water corner is exposed, then fold that triangle into another triangle around the steam wand and thoroughly clean the steam wand. It will take a little time and firm pressure - make sure the wand is clean so that you don't get nasty milk residue build up on your steam wand.

7. Keeping things stocked:
a. Milk. If your family uses milk for other things (cereal, baking, etc.) and up until now you have been a '1-gallon at a time' household, it's time to go up to a 2-gallon at a time household. Trust me - once you (and others in your house) discover the delicious lattes/mochas which are quick at hand, the milk will begin to disappear quickly (my house is now a 3-gallon at a time household with 3 people regularly using the machine).
b. Keep a spare box of to-go cups/lids on hand, when you open it, order another one - it is not cost prohibitive and you never want to be out of to-go cups in the morning.
c. Keep a spare bag of coffee beans on hand - also not cost prohibitive and if you run out of beans, well, there's no reason to ever run out of beans.
d. Keep a spare bottle of your favorite syrups/sauces. If you run out, all the fun is over.

8. Quirks and tips.
a. Keep a close eye (and refill often - like every morning) the water tank in the back (you need not pull it off each time, just take a 4-cup measuring cup and refill it when it gets 1/2-way down). Reason being, the machine is not smart like a Keurig - it has no sensor telling it when the water is out and it will run itself (to its peril) dry when the water runs out - this is not particularly good for the machine or the pumps.
b. Use top quality beans - I recommend buying 1 lb. bags of Starbucks Espresso Roast beans - whole, NEVER pre-ground. WHY would you spend $600 on a coffee bar setup and then use crap beans or pre-ground (aka: not fresh) coffee? When you use top quality Starbucks beans (I have no financial interest in Starbucks by the by - so if you prefer something else like Pete's or Dutch Bros., fine - but make sure you're buying whole bean bags of their Espresso Roast). 2-4 double-shot lattes/mochas per day will go through a 1 lb. bag of beans every 1-2 weeks.
c. Transitioning to decaf beans...? Nope, not easy, nor was the machine set up for an easy transition. To transition from regular espresso beans to decaf beans you must unlock the bean hopper and remove it - then pour the regular beans into a ziplock bag, then take your vacuum cleaner (I'm not joking) and vacuum out the remaining regular beans from the grinding gear mechanism, then replace the (empty) hopper - lock it in place, then fill it with decaf beans. We did this once at my house ... and will never do it again.

I hope you enjoyed my review and it helps you make awesome lattes and mochas!"
1,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the first espresso machine I've ever owned. I purchased it this Spring (2020) because, like many of you, I needed to stop going out. I didn't know much about home brewing espresso, but I have lots of Breville products, and I thought this would be a good entry-level machine., I liked that it had all of the features I needed in a one-stop solution, but would still allow me to make ""real"" espresso, not the stuff that shoots of a pod, which I typically dislike. Armed with nothing more than the instructions it came with, power, water, and beans, I was able to brew espresso good enough to keep me from going into withdrawal, but typically not delicious, and appreciably less enjoyable than my favorite baristas in my favorite cafes. I also wasted a lot of beans in the process. After about 10 days of this bumbling around, I decided to start researching how to get better performance, learning a lot of coffee science along the way, and over the next few months, my technique and results improved, but ultimately plateaued at a point where I felt my home-brewed espresso was now generally better than my favorite baristas - but still not consistent - one day I could make a perfect shot, with all of the lovely sweetness and velvety texture of great espresso, with little or no extraction defect, but then the next day, doing the exact same thing, would get something uneven and over- or under- extracted, and not as good. I was not exactly sure what the variable was, but I suspected it was the grind consistency, since by now I had become very practiced at everything else.

The obvious issues with the grinder are that there is a limited range of adjustment, and as you get to a good fineness for your beans, there will be popcorning - the phenomenon of the beans bouncing off the burrs before passing through; those popcorned beans will be ground more coarsely than the beans that were packed into the grinder by the weight of the beans sitting on top of them. Also, while the machine has a hopper that encourages you store beans in it, that's a terrible idea; it's better to store the beans in an airtight cannister or, if they came from a nice roaster, in their resealable, airtight bags with one-way gas valves. I find that beans that are well-packed like that do not have to be brewed within two weeks of roast, as some coffee trainers say, but rather, can last up to 5 weeks from their roast date, and still be very good, with the peak time for brewing being 7-15 days after roast. Back to popcorning: because the beans will grind differently based upon whether they're at the bottom or top of the pile, this would theoretically render every dose you grind prone to unevenness. This is not a defect of the Barista Express. This is just something in the nature of conical burr grinders. Some craft builders have figured out how to build-in flow control (including the grinder that I now use, which I'll come to that). But you can also be your own flow-control. And that's how I hacked this to get slightly better consistency. I adjusted the grinder to be so fine that it would give me an espresso grind, even feeding only one or two beans at a time, and then did that. In so doing, my grind was more consistent from top to bottom, and my extraction improved significantly. But it was still not totally consistent. And, it makes grinding very labor intensive to feed beans one or two at a time - it makes it take 3-4x as long, and you can't do anything else.

The other thing too - and I learned this early in the adventure - is that you can't rely on the built-in dosing settings for the grinder. Just forget about these. Even if you don't want to go crazy and hand-feed the machine like I do, you need to get a scale. Measure your beans one shot at a time. The dosing volume controls on the machine are not volumetric; they just control how long the grinder runs. Good espresso requires adherence to a brew recipe with a known mass of beans and that can only be done by weighing them. You could take your portafilter and weigh it after the machine dispensed your grind, but this will invariably lead to waste.

Now, 8 months into my new hobby, I treated myself to a new grinder - one you've definitely seen if you watch coffee videos on the internet all day. Now that I use this grinder instead of the built-in grinder, I am not having any problems. In my last 30 shots, 29 have been perfectly-extracted (meaning no channeling, no dead spots, just nice even extraction at the correct pressure levels, resulting in a shot that gets all of the sweetness out of the bean, and little to no bitter or sour flavor) and the 1 that wasn't was because I used the wrong grinder setting. Mea culpa. Oops. That's the kind of consistency I'm looking for. What does this tell me? The coffee brewing function of this machine is top-notch. The group head, shower screen, thermoblock, all of it performs at a professional level, and with the right grind, you can make supremely good espresso on this machine, and do anything you want with it. Drink it straight; make a milk-drink; make an Americano, hot, iced, or whatever you want. Also, the controls are very intuitive, and the build quality is high, as you would expect from Breville. As for maintenance: espresso machines are high maintenance. They require regular cleaning and decaling. But Breville has made it a snap. It takes maybe 10 minutes to descale, every other month, with normal daily usage. A monthly cleaning cycle is so simple it practically runs itself. I also take off the shower screen and make sure it hasn't accumulated too much grit, every few days. That's not necessary - it can go weeks without cleaning and still work, but I am a bit of a perfectionist, as you may have gathered.

I've talked about brewing and grinding, but not steaming. As for steaming: it works fine. I know that there are commercial or prosumer models with slightly more sophisticated steam wands. Because this has a single thermoblock, it is not able to brew and steam at once, in fact, the steam cycle takes quite a while to wind itself up. So you have a Hobbson's choice: steam first, and wait for the temperature to come back down to where it is appropriate for brewing; or brew first, then steam, while your shot goes cold. I don't make a lot of milk drinks, and if you are, it's less important if the shot cools a little. But it just makes the process slower. But once it's running, the steam wand textures milk very nicely. This isn't the most important feature for me, because I drink mostly espresso or Americano, rather than milk drinks. But if you drink mostly milk drinks, then keep this in mind that there are machines with better wands, and better ability to transition from brewing to steaming, out there.
The steam knob on this machine also activates a hot water dispenser, which is very helpful. It automatically cuts off after delivering the right amount of water to make an Americano; two cycles will give me enough to brew a quick cup of tea when I don't want to wait to boil a kettle on the range. That is a plus. However, the steam control, although it rotates, is not a volumetric control, it's just an on-off; you can't dial in more or less steam by opening and closing it more.

So would I recommend this machine? I would say I recommend the Breville family, more than I recommend this particular machine. Because the espresso-brewing is 5-star, but the grinder is only 2 or 3 star, and I am so happy no longer need to use it. If I knew then, what I know now, I would not have gotten an all-in-one machine. I could have gotten a better grinder, and a smaller, lower-cost Breville, like The Infuser, or a larger machine that focuses only on the brew and steam functions, like the amazing Dual Boiler, which might be my next machine. Before I knew better, I liked the space-saving and cost-effectiveness of an all-in-one. But the all-in-one is not going to let you chase perfection in your espresso. So depending on what your wants, needs, budget, and counter space requirements are, you might want to look at other machines in the Breville line, that have the same great controls, fit and finish, customer support, that you would expect from Breville, but that aren't trying to be the jack-of-all-trades.

If you do get this machine, it has almost everything to get up and running (except the water and beans) but I do recommend some accessories:
1. A 54mm bottomless portafilter so you can see your extraction in real time -- this is KEY to learning about extraction defects
2. A drip scale -- or any slim-profile kitchen scale that measure to 0.10s of a gram, so you can accurately weigh your dosage of beans before grinding, and also test your flow rate and mass of your finished product, to ensure that you are getting a good ratio of input to output.
These are a MUST. Without seeing the extraction, and without being able to measure your dosage, you will not be able to make anything resembling tasty espresso from this machine.
Some other things are optional but helpful:
- A rubber tamp mat to protect your counter and limit the mess;
- A 54mm distributor tool to quickly and easily get a nice well-prepared puck. You can do this by hand, but the tool makes it easier, faster, and less messy. The Breville distributor tool that it comes with is useless.
- A 54mm calibrated tamper, so you know that your tamp application is consistent every time. The built-in tamper is adequate, there's nothing wrong with it, it's not useless, but it doesn't give you any guidance for that all-important consistency.
- Lots of replacement filters, cleaning tablets, and descaler.
This machine is not deficient because it doesn't have all of these things (it actually does come with maintenace tools, and starter packs of cleaning tablets and descaler which is really great). It's a very complete package. Great instruction booklet, and all of the nice packaging you would expect from a great company like Breville.

In conclusion: There are many people for whom this probably is the right machine. For me, it's not quite perfect because the grinding function is not as good as the brewing function, and it was bringing down the quality of my results. In hindsight, I should have gotten the Infuser or the Dual Boiler, and a separate grinder. I only started to achieve really consistently great results when I was able to stop using the built-in grinder. But that does prove how good this machine is at brewing. I don't think it's possible to improve much on that."
2,4.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Okay so it takes me around 15 minutes but I clean everything completely every time (filter, tray, etc.) and I haven't learned how to make 100% consistent pull on shots (gauge at same pressure), but I was really surprised by how I can make exact same Latte they make me at Starbucks with same flavor. I have had this machine in my Amazon cart for 4-5 years (I think it has been pretty much the same machine for better part of a decade but may be mistaken). I figure that must say something about design and this is echoed in most reviews I watched. The last straw that made me buy it on Prime Day discount a month ago was that price of my daily Starbucks drink (iced venti vanilla latte) shot up from $5 something to nearly $7. I was reluctant previously because I figured it would take a bunch of time to make myself, be a pain to clean up and I probably couldn't make it taste the same as the Sbux I enjoy... I was mostly wrong on all these counts. When I bought the machine, I found the Sbux Espresso Roast whole beans (around $13 for 18 oz) and Sbux vanilla flavor (around $25 for pack of four 12 oz bottles). I set up the machine in less than 20 minutes and took me only a few tries to get the grind setting (I like 5 ). I use the filter that arrives pre-installed (double wall double shot) and presto my pulls are generally in the middle of the correct pressure range. So I make a three shot venti Iced Latte drink with about half the Vanilla Sbux normally uses (3 pump equivalent) and since I make same drink for my 18yo daughter I do three double shot grinds and pulls to make the two drinks (bonus = bonding with daughter over coffee at home). In the month I have owned and used this machine, I have made those same two drinks every morning in re-usable sbux venti Ice drink cups I bought for few bucks and have gone through two and change bags of beans and two and change bottles of syrup for two triple venti drinks every day for a month = 62 drinks (not counting a few hot lattes and straight shot espressos I experimented with). Buying those same 62 drinks at Sbux would have cost $415 (not count tip I always leave so actually closer to $500 for 62 triple venti Ice lattes at Sbux costing nearly $7 each + tip. So I figure I when just considering supplies I used $30 in beans and syrup and at around $4 per gallon, I have used maybe another $20 in Milk so $50 total in supplies about vs. around $500 for buying the drinks at Sbux including tip means I paying 10% what I used to and have saved $450 ($150 less than I paid for the machine) in a single month on the drinks for me and my daughter. As I started off saying, it does take me 15 minutes from start to finish of cleanup to make those two drinks but it could be half that without cleanup every time but I also never wait in a drive through line. I am very happy with this and really enjoy the smell of the beans and process of making the drinks. You do need to watch the beans level (the hopper is small) and the water tank is also small - I have run out of both beans mid-grind and water mid-brew by not paying attention but otherwise this machine is pretty straight forward. I did experiment with steaming milk and wasn't a big deal but you can't really steam that much milk at a time with small carafe and steam wand (made more for 8 oz. mug drink vs. venti hot latte I think, but I mostly like iced drinks. Anyway the steam worked fine and the espresso also tastes great straight and gets good crema (spelling?) if that's your thing. Anyway I would recommend this machine for sure to someone like me and I wish I bought it years ago. Cheers!"
3,5.0,2020-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update 9/19/2020-- The machine continues to may fantastic coffee. Enjoying some right now. One of our most used small appliances during the pandemic. Will never go back to SB again. It compares very poorly to what I can make at home now. Have run the descale cycle once because the light turned on, but I think it is set to turn on at a certain number of cycles rather than based on actual scale build up since we use RO water and scale build up is minimal. In any case, certainly does not hurt. Another tip I've got is to get yourself some disposable earplugs and set them next to the machine. The decibels during steaming can be really high and they hurt my ears. I also keep a quick read thermometer on the machine to know when my steamed milk is at the temp I like.

Update 6/17/2020: This has ended up being one of my favorite birthday presents I gotten in years. Prior to owning the machine my family had a $100/week Starbucks habit. Since purchasing this machine 4 months ago, we've spent maybe $40 at SB. With COVID19, we've been at home and using this machine several times per day. The coffee it makes has only gotten better as we've learned to calibrate it. It has more than paid for itself in a few short months. It is well designed. We drink mostly Americanos so the hot water dispenser with automatic shut off is one of my favorite features. We were able to reprogram the machine to raise the water temperature very easily. The only glitches have come with the grinder which is a bit temperamental with certain beans, but these have been minor. The coffee the machine produces is delicious with a good amount of crema. I run a cleaning table through the machine about once per month, but because we have a reverse osmosis filter on our tap, we have had no need to descale. I highly recommend using reverse osmosis filtered water in the machine to cut down on internal build up. The machine is fairly easy to clean and has a lot of nice touches like the little float indicator that tells you when you need to empty the drip tray. We also like the ability to calibrate shots. I am raising our review from 4 to 5 stars since it seems that our poor experience with the first machine we received was just luck of the draw and we really have no complaints with our current machine. It is wonderful!
Update: 2/18/2020 Amazon agreed to swap out the lemon (see original review below) for a new Breville Barista Express. It arrived today. I set it up and ran two cleaning tablets (3 cleaning cycles) before I even tried to make my first cup of espresso. I let the machine warm completely and set the grind size at 5 as suggested. Pulled my first shot and the new machine performed perfectly with the pressure reaching and staying in the middle of the gray extracting zone as it should. The shot was smooth with beautiful crema. I took the opportunity to program this shot so that it would be exactly 1 oz using my little espresso cup. I then pulled a double shot and did the same thing programming the machine to fill two of my espresso cups. Again the pressure was perfect at the level 5 grind size setting and the coffee is absolutely delicious with a beautiful smooth crema. Apparently the first machine I received was a dud. I'm glad Amazon allowed me to swap and will be sending the old one back tomorrow. I've changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars. If the new machine continues to perform as it did in its maiden voyage, I will revisit the rating and perhaps raise it to 5 stars. I highly recommend that anyone who buys one of these start off with a couple of clean/descale cycles before trying to make coffee. Save yourself a headache and a lot of wasted coffee.
Pros: Very attractive and sturdy. The hot water dispenser is super convenient for making Americanos which is what I drink. I now don't have to heat up a separate kettle of hot water. It's great. The built-in grinder is really nice and its automatic function that also allows manual operation is convenient. The programmable temperature and shot amount adjustments are great.
Cons: Because it takes so much water to keep the machine clean and operating well (it flushes itself after each use of steam or hot water) the water receptacle has to be refilled OFTEN (around every 3-4 coffees for me). I wish the machine had a bigger water tank. The drip tray also needs to be changed fairly often because the machine flushes itself, but this is does not bother me as much and it is not as often as the water tank. The grinder amounts tend to fluctuate and I'm still trying to figure out what adjustments or cleaning will might fix this. I'm not impressed with their customer service. When I tried to get help for the first unit I purchased (which ended up being defective), it took a couple of days to get a response and then that was an email with the exact same information contained in the user's manual (I guess the assumption was that I had not read it) along with a flat dismissal that there could be anything wrong with the machine. Thankfully, Amazon dealt with the problem quickly by replacing the machine so I did not have to rely on Breville. I hope that I have a better response if I ever need to contact Breville in the future.

Original review:
I've wasted almost a pound of coffee over the past day trying to get the pressure on this machine to the ""espresso"" level that the instructions say is required. The machine will not go beyond the ""pre infusion"" level. I have cleaned it with the cleaning tablet as suggested in some of the reviews and I have adjusted the grind fineness and grind amount to every combination I can think of. Both settings are currently at the maximum levels. I've tamped the coffee harder and also used less pressure. NOTHING works. Like I said, I grew up with espresso as it is a daily drink in my culture. When I was little, my mom made it a the little stovetop espresso pot. My last espresso maker was a $79 Mr. Coffee that lasted almost 7 years and made very decent coffee with a nice crema everytime. No fuss. Then it finally broke and I can't find that model. I didn't want the new models with milk receptacles. Yuck! Anyway, I thought, well if I'm going to spend over $200 on Mr. Coffee, why not just splurge and get the Breville. The coffee I've so far gotten from this machine is thin and acidic and has almost no crema. As I've said, I have tried everything suggested. The pressure gage only reached the correct level on two shots after I had just cleaned it and then it went back to barely registering. IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DECENT CUP OF COFFEE! Right now I feel like all these 5 star reviews are a product of the psychological phenomenon that happens with very expensive wine, where people report it tastes better because they don't want to seem stupid for paying so much and not liking it. I will update if it turns out I'm just missing the magic key to having this thing not be a ridiculously expensive pain in my coffee loving butt. But I'm not feeling hopeful."
4,5.0,2022-08-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update June 2nd 2019: Still use it daily, and it's working well! It's now been almost 4 years! (Time flies when you're drinking good coffee :)

Update August-6-17: Still going strong after almost two years!

Original Review and Tips:

I love this thing. I've been using it multiple times a day for almost a year I think. Every day it makes amazing espresso, and as long as I keep it clean it preforms beautifully. This thing is also easier to maintain and requires less cleaning than other cheaper espresso machines I've tried.

A tip for anyone looking to make actual espresso at home, I recommend looking for a local roastery in your area. I use to buy bulk beans online like many people, but once I tried local whole beans and found a blend I liked, the difference was amazing. Bean choice is very important if you actually want to enjoy your espresso!

A few tips I picked up for using this machine:
1. A few people complained about the grind amount knob not going low enough. To counteract this, I changed the cup size to ""Single"" and increased the grind amount by turning the knob to the right. This gives me the perfect amount of ground coffee every time.
2. If the machine keeps going over or under on the pressure gauge, try cleaning the grinder. And remember to clean the grouphead with those desolvable tablets when the clean me light comes on!
3. You can get cheap replacement cleaning tablets here on amazon. I chose Urnex Cafiza Espresso Machine Cleaning Tablets here on amazon, and they work great!
4. You do not need to order a separate tamper, the one included is perfect.
5. The included frothing cup is small but works for me. Some might need a bigger one.
6. Do not underestimate the need for a burr grinder. Trying to make good espresso without one is like trying to hammer a nail with an inflatable hammer!

Some of the features I love (Pros)*
1) The grinder. I know many would rather use a separate burr grinder, but this thing works perfectly fine, and is easy to clean. Many complained about the coffee machine heating up the beans too much if you leave them inside the hopper, but I actually store my beans in a special container outside of the hopper, and use the included the scoop to pour in the beans when I grind them.
2) The frother is amazing. Much much better than cheaper machines.
3) Clean me light is awesome. Always reminds me to keep up on this things maintenance, and helps prolong the life.
4) The Stainless steel is beautiful. (It is not 100% stainless on the outside though, a little bit of plastic, see cons.)
5) The pressure gauge. Absolutely invaluable in making good tasting espresso. I would not recommend buying any machine without one. It really helps with learning and getting it right!
6) The included tamper is perfect.
7) Creates perfect pucks of coffee to dump out in the trash.
8) The hot water dispenser is an awesome addition!
9) Is an all-in-one, meaning I don't need to buy a separate grinder!
10) Just makes good coffee.
11) Great manual included for lots of useful information.
12) Has an automated cleaning cycle to clean the insides of the grouphead. Awesome!
14) Includes a beautiful copper dosing tool.
15) Includes tools to clean out the filters.

Some things that bother me (Cons)*
1)The top of the machine is plastic.
2) The bottom sides of the machine is plastic
3) The water tank needs to be refilled often, and it also thick plastic.
4) The bottom water catcher thing (sorry) needs to be emptied often, but its not too bad.
5) The coffee grind separator doesn't really seem to help much, but it does help keep it out of the water below and little bit, which keeps it from smelling!
6) Expensive, but to me, was a very worthwhile investment for how much coffee I was buying from the shop.
7) Can't seem to find inexpensive filters for the water tank, however, I use filtered water instead of tap.
8) The Lowest grind amount is too much on the ""double"" setting. QC Should have caught this! But not a deal breaker. See above for workaround.

*Might add more later as I think of them!

This thing is also great for making sweet frappicinos and iced drinks.
For caramel flavored drinks I use Hershey's Caramel Syrup (Edit: I now make my own caramel syrup! It's super easy!)
For vanilla flavored drinks I use Torani Vanilla Syrup that I get cheaply from a bulk wholesale store in my town.

For my sweet drink of choice I mix the two, add a double shot of espresso, 2% milk, and top with whipped cream and caramel syrup.

Nothing beats a great espresso in the morning!

Added tons of pictures.

Edit: It seems quite a few people had problems with the machine dying on them, If your machine died on your please comment on this review with any information you think may help, such as the level of maintenance you preformed while your machine was working, the brand of water filters and cleaning tablets you used, etc.

Maybe we can find a common cause of this defect!"
5,4.0,2020-02-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Let me start off by saying this. This machine is perfect if you:
- Don’t want to spend $10-$20/week on coffee beans
- Just need morning caffeine and don’t know/care about the frivolities of espresso
- Do want to have time for other hobbies/activities in the morning
- Want to impress the occasional guests but still go to cafes on the regular

It does the job that you need it to do and a little bit more. It is easy to setup, use and maintain. It will feasibly last as long as most other kitchen appliances if you’re making 1-2 coffees per day. For the price, you can’t really find a comparable deal (a decent grinder, volumetrically programmable espresso machine, decent steaming power and ease of use). So if you like coffee but don’t want to obsess the minutiae, then this machine is perfect.

—

However, I must also confess I’ve basically given this machine away to a (close) friend. If you’re obsessive and are looking to develop coffee/espresso/milk-based drinks as a hobby, this is not the machine for you. I think there will be many people expecting this to be a starter setup that they will upgrade from. I encourage those to look at used items at a discount (Rancilio Silvia + Rocky grinder or sette) or machines without as many creature comforts (Gaggia classic + knock feld2 hand grinder) as a serious alternative. With those, you can grow with your machine and eventually take all of the accumulated accessories with you to your dream setup.

Setup/Ease of use (5/5):
Setting the Breville barista express is easy. Out of the box, there’s all you need to get started (minus the glass and coffee, BYO) and a condensed pamphlet for those too busy to read the more extensive manual. Time from initial plug in to brew ready is 1 minute max and the grinder is immediately ready. The central brew pressure gauge is good as another way to help dial in a new coffee. There is a solenoid value (behind the front plate) which relieves brew water from the coffee bed and brewing chamber after the shot is complete to allow for easy cleaning. The drip tray is large and has an indicator when it needs to be emptied. The water tank is large enough to be filled once a week and container a spot for A cycle-count based cleaning indicator will also alert the need for backflushing and descaling.

Programability (4/5):
I was actually surprised by how programmable this machine is. Not only is there timed grinding and volumetric shot programs, there’s temperature control (!!). This might not seem that amazing, but at the price point, I’m not sure there’s anything actually offering that feature. You can play with temperature as a variable in addition to grinding/portafilter prep. The only downside is that the machine can’t be programmed to turn on/off and a switch won’t help with that.

Grinder (3/5):
This is where the machine starts to falter. The grinder is stepped (13 knob based adjustments, 10 burr based adjustments) which isn’t ideal for espresso. However, you can definitely still grind fine enough for espresso. Just anticipate a single step creating a pretty large jump in shot time. Also, the grind tends to come out clumpy so further grind distribution techniques will be required to avoid channeling. The grinds themselves seem to collect in mound first (I suspect due to the smaller conical burrs that get quite hot) and leads to grinds falling out of the portafilter before actually filling it. The first material upgrade I made with this setup was a separate grinder. However, it feels like a waste when there’s the option to buy this as a stand alone espresso maker and grinder. Overall grind retention is very poor meaning a morning bleed/flush is necessary (and a waste of perfectly good beans). It was actually so bad that I realized this was problem (6 months), I couldn’t consistently pull 2 shots on any given day.

Espresso (4/5):
This machine includes ~5 seconds of preinfusion + normal vibration pump driven brewing. The shower screen is a bit taller than you would think so leave a decent of head space when tamping. The machine is perfectly capable of pulling good to great shots of espresso. It helps to ensure the group head and portafilter are sufficiently warm before brewing.

Steaming (4/5):
I’m not big on steaming milk so I can’t add much here. Just know that it takes quite a while for the machine to ramp up to steaming temp (Thermoblock - basically an aluminum radiator- rather than a traditional boiler). Once up to temp, the machine can definitely produce enough micro-foam out of the single steam hole for latte art.

Hot water:
There is hot water (which actually can’t be said for some machines in this price point).

Included accessories:
Double spouted portafilter (2/5) - This is actually one of my largest gripes. The portafilter does not give the growth potential for to those who want to “ascend” into cafe level espresso. The size is 54mm (possibly even 53?) in diameter and has a channeled plastic base to remove brew output inconsistencies. These might not seem like a big issues but they seriously hamper your ability to correct what’s wrong. The channeled base removes the ability to diagnose potential tamping inconsistencies. The size is restrictive because it doesn’t allow you to find many accessories in the market. Common portafilter sizes are 49mm (old Italian style), 51mm (idk, newer Italian style?) and 58mm (commercial sized). Many techniques to overcoming a poor grinder will require portafilter accessories (Weiss distribution technique: funnel, top distribution tools: OCD, blind shaker etc.).

Tamper (3/5) - could be heavier in hand and handle is a bit small

Milk pitcher (4/5) - its fine.

Single + Double non-pressurized baskets (4/5) - they work, I wouldn’t recommend using the single basket since its a bit shallow

Single + Double pressurized baskets (5/5) - great addition for those not wishing to fuss with grinding/tamping too much to dial in

Water filter (5/5) - love seeing this included, helps slow down scale build up
Backflush disc
Coffee scoop
Cleaning supplies (for one full cycle, backflush tablet + descaler), brush for grinder, steam hole reamer
Hex wrench (for removing shower screen)

Nits:
The cleaning light came on at 8 months and never turn off despite multiple cleaning and descaling cycles
Breville support is hit and miss. Don’t expect anything out of warranty and its kind of hard to get normal day to day support.
The casing is actually plastic wrapped in aluminum. Its fine if you don’t beat the machine up but it won’t last as long as a 100% metal-bodied machine
Burr-based grind adjustments are a pain in the ass. Espresso dust can get between the burrs and make it difficult to place the top burr back in without a thorough (read: turn the thing sideways and go at it with a brush) cleaning
Aluminum grate on drip tray has sharp edges

To be perfectly fair, I believe I’m asking for things that are well outside of the price point or consumer group this is designed to fit in. However, it does feel like Breville priced this machine down (given the advanced and full feature set) to make it less user configurable. This means that it will serve 80% of the people who buy it very well. But, for the 20% that want to completely outdo their local tattooed, mustached and bespectacled barista, it's not likely to happen on this setup. Even if you get the best beans and put in the practice, the process is still very much so equipment dependent. Don’t get me wrong…you will make some spectacular drinks on this machine. But every time? Every day? Cafe quality? The odds are pretty low."
6,4.0,2016-08-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Works great and makes a great espresso once you get the hang of it. I wasted a full bag of beans getting it all figured out. First order the press https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZT42HZF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and the dosing cup https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09P52FG4X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and a digital scale. This will make your set up easier. The larger milk cup is a must https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097KG41P9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 if you normally get a Venti size at the store. You'll have to play with the grind size, I have mine at 11 or 10 for the Starbucks espresso bean. When you put the grind in the filter, tap it from the bottom to settle the grind, using the cup will save you a lot of lost grind in the sink. I weigh my beans in the cup first, 18g of beans. Dump into the grinder and grind into to dosing cup. Flip the dosing cup upside down into the double filter, leave the dosing cup on top and tap the bottom until it all settles nicely into the filter. There should be zero grind falling out. Press down with the hand tamper listed above. Then I move the scale and shot glass under the spouts and measure to 60g of liquid. I always make a caramel macchiato, which is 2 tsp of vanilla and topped with caramel sauce to the liking. I've already paid for this machine just in trips to the store at $6 - 7 a Venti purchase. It does get loud when heating/frothing the milk. Love this machine and use it everyday after breakfast. Takes about 15-20 minutes to warm up. Oh and I get mine extra hot, which done by heating the milk till you can not hold the milk cup, froth the milk to your liking and then sit it back down under the steamer for another 30 seconds. Super hot.
Don't forget to purge the milk steamer wand and brew area after a each use. Easy to clean."
7,5.0,2019-04-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Okay guys, I LOVE this machine. I owned restaurants in SF for over 15 years, where there are amazing cafes and excellent coffee all over the city. If you go to North Beach neighborhood in SF, you will find excellent coffee at numbers old and established coffee houses. So when we started our restaurant/cafe back in 1992, my French born husband said ""The coffee better be damn good if we want to survive as a business in SF"". So we learned all about the coffee business and were trained by Illy cafe and then later by ""Cafe Roma"" in North Beach where they roast their own coffee. We learned all the nuances in making an excellent espresso, cappuccino and latte, etc. For example one coffee trainer told us the espresso must come out ""like the tail of a mouse"". If it is too fast or too slow, the coffee will either be weak or bitter. Well, my home Breville makes excellent espresso and I can honestly say, it would compete with any SF cafe in North Beach. And my foam/milk is creamy, satin like and so perfect. So not one complaint with this machine. HOWEVER...I just looked up the machine as I was searching for replacement water filters and I see it is now $749!!! I paid $549 in December of 2021. Yikes!!! a $200 increase in 8 months? Not sure if I should say thank you Biden, thank you or thank you China? The machines are manufactured apparently in China...darn. I wish it was manufactured in Italy or USA. And another interesting fact...Breville was founded in Australia in 1932 by Harry Norville and Bill O'Brien. The two partners combined their names, and Breville was born. The company rose to prominence with the introduction of the toaster in 1974, and since 2000, has become a global force, producing some of the best espresso machines in the market. Great coffee...but $750 takes it off the market for a lot of folks."
8,5.0,2022-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have had the unit for 8 months now, it's been through 4 cleaning cycles (2 descaling, 2 normal backflow), so I've 'tested' out most of the possible functions it has. We like it, a lot. If it dies this year, it is probably a break-even so far based on the number of times we've used it vice buying from coffee shops. At $5 a cup, you have to buy at least 120 cups to even do a simple break-even. Of course, using milk/substitute and other items at home adds to this cost. Assume that you have to run 200 cups at home that you otherwise would have bought elsewhere, and you have basically done a break-even. If you drive to get to the coffee shop, and buy other things, then it may save you a lot of money sooner. In my opinion, this unit easily costs less than what we would have done within a year.

The grinder seems to do a great job, and the dials to alter the size and amount, work well. I have had to clean it once since the grinds seemed to be working poorly, on Breville's recommendation, running rice through the unit, and then cleaning it (removing the screw from the top), helped.

We have not tried other machines, having been satisfied with the reviews, and price, of this one as listed. So far, just great results. We tend to do espresso drinks each time, meaning we use the grinder, frother, and espresso for each drink. The machine would likely last longer with less maintenance needed if you just did espresso, and used preground beans (or had a separate grinder), most likely.

Family of 2 (with kid), in general we probably push through 4-6 cups a day on average, and up to 9 max at times. If we have guests, maybe 10-12, but not often. While we would certainly have NOT been buying this many from the local brewhouse, the quality of the product is just great.

We choose to use almond milk exclusively as our base, and we make it ourselves, so the quality of the milk will never be that of the rich and creamy milk frothed up, but it is still amazing. This machine does a great job of grinding, pushing hot water, and frothing, so we get a cup that literally is as good as we ever had anywhere, and with the quality we want. Most coffee shops, when they do have milk substitutes, use poor quality almond milk anyhow, and it affects the taste. If you haven't tried making your own almond milk, it's extremely easy - don't bother unless you buy good almonds from Spain or California. Soak them (called sprouting), then blend 1 cup almonds to 4 cups milk. Then strain through a nut milk bag (or cheesecloth), and add 2-3TB honey, vanilla bean, pinch salt, cinnamon). Blend. Some folks have gently heated the almond milk on a stove which helps thicken it a bit, and actually makes it more of a milk consistency than the 'almond juice' that you get by just straining. Lots of different options, and chefs are still coming up with ways to handle this. But frankly, after doing the almond milk thing, we will not use anything else. Some folks also add some coconut creme to the mix, and it also thickens things a bit. There are excellent non dairy and healthy alternatives out there, and they work shockingly well.

We also pretty much gave up on buying beans from local brewhouses, we found the quality and taste not as good as we could do ourselves, so off we went and bought a small roaster (Fresh Roast SR700 Home Coffee Roaster), and frankly, this make the cycle complete - not only can we buy green coffee beans via amazon very cheaply, but we can also control how much we roast, and when we use them, making it a very turnkey and enjoyable experience.

I advise also buying the Knockbox from Breville - this is a great add on and helps you control the waste from the Portafilter. Great tool/wastebasket, and helps you inadvertently throw your grinds into the drain, not good if you have a septic system either!!

Agree with prior posters - use fresh beans, and consider roasting your own. The best bean we've found so far is the Colombian Huila (also sold on Amazon.com) - 5lb bag for $30 shipped. For about $6 a pound, you will have plenty of opportunity to find the roast level you want. Reason we like this particular bean (other than being available on amazon.com), when roasted to near or after second crack, it has a nice caramel/chocolate aftertaste to it. Not a bean expert here, but we've tried a dozen or so varieties, and for the price and availability, this is a really well priced and nice tasting bean. As mentioned before, we've done the local brewhouse roasted beans, and it's basically russian roulette, and we've yet to find an 'awesome' tasting bean from them. The breville has a multiple of ways you can alter the taste by changing the temperature, grind, and amount of water through the bean, but some beans just aren't suited for espresso, it seems. I'll let the experts deal with that - once we find one that is suitable, we work more on the base taste, which is mostly affected by the milk/milk substitute that you use, unless you are just doing straight shots of espresso.

We like the machine so much, it's worth considering taking with you on travel if you have the power, and way to store your own milk at your location. And yes, we've been at places with in-room espresso machines like the Ritz, which has in-room espresso from Nespresso, to places that have full kitchens with a variety of machines, and places with club level places that have fully automatic machines. We continue to be underwhelmed with the quality and taste that most places do. Yes, we've been in Italy and had the best espresso/cappuccino's, and they can't be beaten due to the location, ambiance, etc. This machine does a bang up job of that without the expense of travel - lol.

Frankly, Breville has provided a cost point and quality machine that is hard to beat. Other than my calling for help on a small grind question/issue, I have had no service issues yet.

From other posters, if there are substantial issues that start to creep up after the 1 year mark, it's kind of a cost tradeoff to consider paying $250 for a repair, or just buying a new one. I guess there is also a warranty you can buy if bought through Amazon, that goes up to 4 years, so that may be an option to keep it running longer, and truly have cost savings for many years to come."
9,5.0,2022-08-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I absolutely love this machine. With as many lattes as I drink, this will easily pay for itself within a year, inclouding the cost of beans, milk and cleaning products.

Notes: Make sure to keep up with all the regular maintenance. Ever day after I've made my coffee, I wipe the steam wand, purge it, then wipe again. Make sure to get into all the crevices around the tip and you'll never need to use the pin to clean out the tip. Once I've done that and poured my steamed milk, I purge the showerhead by pulling one shot into the empty mug (no filters). This keeps the showerhead clean of coffee debris and keeps the coffee tasting pure.

REMEMBER TO CHANGE YOUR WATER FILTERS. The filters should be changed every 60 uses or 2 months, whichever comes first. This wolill reduce how often you need to descale the machine, prolong it's useful life and provide better tasting coffees. You will still need to descale the machine every so often. The manual included is very helpful for keeping up with the maintenance (as well as pulling shots, making drinks and other useful tips) and you can also find instructions on their website should you misplace the manual. Gold tone makes pretty inexpensive replacement filters specific to this machine and they're available here on Amazon. I use them and am pretty happy with the results.

Do not let the water run out. Ever. This could cause serious damage to the machine. If you forget once or twice, you'll probably be just fine but check the water reservoir at least 1-2 times per week.

Clean the machine parts at least once a week. You may need to empty and rinse the drip tray 1-2 times a week (depending on frequency of use) but take it out and hand wash at least once a week. This is a good time to wash the tools and tool bin as well. Also, dont forget to take the coffee filters out of the portafilter and wash those as well. Over time, residue can build up underneath there. Also, the spouts in the portafiler twist off so you can clean them better. Clean out your parts, get in those crevices regularly and you'll be just fine.

Don't forget to clean the hopper and grinder. You should clean it out every time you switch to a new bean or at least every few pounds of coffee. The instructions in the manual are pretty easy and straight forward. I also use a clean, dry towel to wipe any remaining coffee and oils from both the grinder parts and the hopper. Do not wash in warm water as you could risk it not drying well and rusting or not being lubricated enough and over heating. Just use the included brush and clean, dry paper towels. You could also vacuum out residual coffee from the grinder to assist in cleaning, but I don't usually need to.

Also, remember that the stainless exterior is stainless plating. This means it can wear over time and not look as nice. The best way to handle this is to wipe it down with a damp cloth (once daily then more detailed once a week) and follow it up by drying it with a clean towel. This will prolong the exterior appearance. Also during your weekly cleaning, be sure to look under where the coffee and steam come out and clean around there. Milk, coffee and residue steam can splatter and build up so be sure to clean it as well.
The weekly cleaning sound intensive but really takes maybe 5 minutes.

Common issues: Keep in mind certain o-rings will need to be replaced over time. This is noted by Breville in the manual and on the website. There are two main places where you need to replace these: around the tip of the portafilter (where the spouts connect) and where the portafilter connects to pull shots.

Another common issue is that the machine will make a loud ""buzzing"" sound and/or leak water out of the bottom of the machine. This is a common issue and, when it does occur, usually happens around 6 months to a year. This generally occurs due to a broken solenoid valve. If your product is still under warranty, take a video and contact their customer service. Maybe suggest it's a solenoid valve and they are usually very good about fixing or replacing the machines and parts. If it is no longer under warranty and they will not resolve the issue (because sometimes they still will after the warranty period), there are many repair services that can fix this. If you are especially handy and brave enough to fix it yourself, you can usually find the replacement parts fairly cheaply online (not just the valve, but really ANY part that may need to be replaced). Again, if it's still under warranty do not go this route, as it will void any existing warranty. Also, if you don't know what you're doing, you could do more damage than good.

All-in-all, this is an amazing machine for this price point. There is a reason this machine is so popular and highly rated. There's a lot of customization available to you and it is a very good quality machine. I would not suggest any product below this machine and price point for your first machine as you'll likely be very disappointed in the results. Eventually you may want to upgrade to a more robust multi-thousand dollar machine, but this is great for the majority of consumers and is super user friendly. Use higher quality beans directly from the roasters and learn how to use the machine and make drinks and you'll be very happy with it. The quality is truly amazing for such a low cost espresso machine.

Side note: Whole Latte Love on YouTube is a great resource for additional reviews, tips and tricks and maintenance for this machine (and many more). It's also a great resource on how to pull shots, steam milk, pick types of milk and make many different types of drinks when you're just starting out or want to up your coffee game."
10,5.0,2016-05-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Fantastic espresso machine. You get your grinder (with adjustable dosage, and two dials to change the coarseness - the second adjustment is directly inside the grinder), pump, steam wand, hot water spout and a nice tamper all in one machine!
The accessories you get with it are great as well, you get the porta-filter holder (duh), 4 baskets (single and double serve with single walls and the same in double-wall setup), precision dosage razor, frothing pitcher and the cleaning kit. Really don't need much more than this, so if you're looking for a serious espresso machine with all included, this one is it. And the 1,500+ reviews and average over 4.5 stars just proves that.

I debated going with this one or something cheaper. I recently used to have a DeLonghi EC155. That thing started at 4.0 stars or higher, but now I see it lower, I understand why. For a first try of ""espresso"" coffee, it was okay. I put it in quotation marks, because it was more like a really strong coffee, didn't quite come across as espresso. Maybe I did it wrong. But anyway, I am not reviewing that machine here.

With this machine, there is one thing you need to realize (and a video review of Breville, or rather ""Sage"" as this brand is known in Europe) is this - with this machine, you're not only getting into serious coffee, you're probably getting into a hobby as well, or a new activity. If you are looking for a simple serve machine that prepares a great coffee with one push of a button, look elsewhere, like the Nespresso machines.
But, if you are looking for something that is a little more involved, gives you the desired control, allows you to experiment and pulls you into the world of coffee, this is it. There is a reason why you pay $2-2.50 for just an espresso at a coffee shop. It takes work, it takes skill and it takes time. Once you start pulling your own great (or good for me, I'm not at the ""great"" level quite yet) coffee, the sense of accomplishment along with a great drink at home feels nice.
I think it retails at around $560 right now. I put it on my wish list in August 2017 I believe and kept watching the price. Then I noticed it dropped below $500 for like a day and half and I ended up getting this machine for $460. I still would probably purchase it for $560, but man, what a deal.

Don't forget that cheap/stale beans just won't do. I mean, if you got a car for a race track, you probably wouldn't pour in regular 87 gas, no, you'd go with the premium high-octane stuff. Similar with this - you got an awesome, professional-like machine, then feed it quality beans. I mean, you can try to go cheaper, but if you get very oily and stale beans, the coffee will taste burnt and you'll end up spending more time cleaning the thing.

Pros:
1) Sense of control - there is so much experimentation you can do. I've had this for 3 months and I'm still at the beginning. I now froth milk in a decent way but boy, there is a lot to learn.
2) All-in-one - you don't have to get an expensive grinder, fancy wooden tamper and a milk frother. I mean, you could, but why would you, if you have that high quality all built into this one?
3) The supplied equipment - kind of goes with point number 2, but you get a frothing pitcher as well, you get multiple baskets and you get everything you need to get rolling (besides the beans).
4) Quality - it is all stainless steel and what isn't (and is plastic) doesn't feel cheaply made. It seems sturdy and high quality. I've had it for 3 months now, so far so good, so ask me in a few months if I still think so.
5) The display/indicators - it tells you when it wants to be cleaned. I spoke to their customer reps and this was their exact email response:
""I have confirmed with our technicians, they advised me it will actually come on after 300 shots, and unplugging the unit should not reset the counter. "" You also have a dedicated button for filter size, you can let it automatically grind the specific amount of coffee you want - this brings me to one of the cons, however.

Cons:
1) As mentioned pro #5, the grinding amount is a bit of a pain. When coffee is ground, it tends to expand. If you let the machine grind the automatic amount, it overfills the basket (because the coffee expands) and you get grounds falling over into the tray. This may not be a design flaw, because when you tap the filter onto the counter, the grinds settle and you do have the right amount, it's just a mess though - someone slightly OCD like myself finds that hard to deal with. I just use the manual grind, I hold it in, let it fill half way, tap it to let it settle, grind some more and tamp. Time consuming, yes, but it's more fun and cleaner.
2) If you live in an area with hard water (like I do), be prepared for water spots all over that beautiful stainless steel - again, not a manufacturer's flaw, but worth mentioning.

I keep trying to think of other cons, but can't. That's when you know it's a good unit, when you ""try"" to think of cons just for the review and can't come up with any legit ones.

Again, if you want a great coffee machine that will feed (or create) a coffee hobby and make you want to experiment, source local beans and just overall make your own fantastic coffee, go right ahead. I'd say it's worth the money.
If you're looking for a morning/quick convenience of pressing a button and that's it, look elsewhere, this isn't for you. I would also like to say that this machine is my after-work or weekend espresso/play around machine, for my quick morning coffee I have a small Mr. Coffee steam machine (and a Cuisinart grinder).

Let me know if this was helpful, I'm open to any questions!"
11,5.0,2018-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville Barista Express is my first foray into homemade espressos. It has been enjoyable to learn espresso making with this machine, and the grind settings have been easy to change for the different roasts that I've pulled espresso from. The setup was quick and simple, and I was making consistent espresso after my first few trial attempts. I believe the learning curve will vary, but it only took me about an hour with no prior experience of making espressos myself. I would highly recommend that you watch espresso making tutorials with a particular machine as I did before purchasing. You can draw hot water in less than 30 seconds from turning the machine on, but I would recommend leaving it on for longer before pulling your first espresso of the day. For me that time has been about 15-20 minutes but recommendations will vary. The level of noise this machine makes during use is decently loud, but I feel it's tolerable. I have no comparison however as this is my first espresso machine. Also, I've yet to use the steam wand as I usually don't go for cappuccinos; I just make Americanos with this. The Breville Barista Express has produced me good, consistent tasting espresso and is an machine I would recommend to anyone I know."
12,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"I have to preface this review by pointing out that I'm not a coffee guru. Not an expert barista. Not schooled in the art of espressos. So with that in mind, take this as pure opinion from a frugal consumer who loves coffee house coffees, cappuccinos and lattes, but hates coffee house prices.

I bought this machine because over the years I've purchased coffee makers, moka pots, etc., trying to up my coffee game but never quite getting the same result as those coffee house drinks. The closest I've come so far is the moka pot, but it's still not quite there yet. Granted, those coffee houses have espresso machines that cost thousands of dollars. Hey! I like coffee as much as anyone, but not THAT much. I refuse to pay that amount, even if I have the means. It's not how much you make. It's how much you keep. Right? Anyway, I chose the Breville Barista Express because 1) I love their products and they've been reliable for me over the years. And 2) this model has enough power and features at a reasonable price for someone who is no expert. I bought this model for $599.99 + tax on a Black Friday sale (not a huge one, but still) because it's the only amount I could stomach to pay for a machine like this. Plus it was my Christmas gift to me. I have to say that it's been totally worth it! I suspect even those who are anal about their coffee would love this machine as well.

My first cappuccino on this thing was not great. In fact, it was horrid! It may have had something to do with the fact that I dislike reading instructions and barely made it through the quick startup guide. When will I ever learn? But I have the patience of a five year old on Christmas morning. I couldn't wait to get to it. So, after that first disappointing cup I watched a few videos on YouTube. Fine. More than a few. And I finally thumbed through the manual. The videos were more helpful when it came to creating the best cup. All the tips were valuable. And gradually I saw improvement until I got to what seemed like a good cappuccino. So far so good. But still not quite there yet. So I followed another tip and got better coffee beans. Oh dear! Now comes more tweaking. Because when you change to another bean the entire process starts over. Until finally, the cup I wanted and craved. Wow! What a difference.

I'm improving with each cup and small tweak. The grind, the amount, the tamp pressure, the amount of milk (or almond milk or oat milk), the amount of sugar, cinnamon or no cinnamon, etc. I had no idea how much actually went into a good cup of coffee. But I'm appreciating it more and more. And I'm getting spoiled. So much so that my other coffee machines (standard, Keurig, moka pot) are all taking a back seat and getting less use. Like none, lately. The other thing I appreciate more is the local barista in those coffee houses. I may not frequent them as much in the future. But I don't think I'll ever complain about the price again. I will gladly tip the barista. And I will simply enjoy the fruits of their labor.

KEY POINTS: The learning curve is real. Have patience. The end result is worth the effort and the cost of this machine. This espresso machine is a great buy for both the novice and the more experienced barista. It will pay for itself in the long run.

Now I'll go make myself a cappuccino. Happy 2022! #PeaceOnEarth #ItsTheLittleThings #Enjoy"
13,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"Its been a month since I have bought this machine. I have not worked every coffee making device out there but I have operated and tasted many. I had just lost my Deloghni magnifca super automatic machine after seven years of use. It was a pretty good machine for being a super automatic. But I have craved to get a real espresso machine and do a proper cappuccino. I have used french presses, Vietnamese phins, drip, siphon, and single serve kuerigs. Being in the Pacific NW you would except awesome cafe's everywhere, and you would be wrong. To get a good barrista that knows what they are doing, is slim to none. So with the exit of my super auto, I shopped for a good one. I kept coming back to the breville. Only knocks it was really getting was that breville was Australian and new to the game. I took the plunge and bought it, and I do not regret it.

So the good:
It comes with its own grinder. It not the best, but then again its no slouch. It can be taken apart and cleaned. My super never did that. What this means is that as you build up grounds on the Burr, you can pull it apart easily and clean it. It has a hopper that you can remove and place unused beans back in its container, that is just awesome, you can make decafe then switch to a new bean. A reviewer gave a good tip that when you first run it, start at the coarse then work it to fine when you start to grind, good advice. I word of caution from me, every different roast of bean will be a new setting for the machine. If you use a oily bean, then you might have to clean the burr a lot in order to get that fine grind. Also be prepared to go through a lot of coffee to figure out the right setting to get that perfect cup.
Temperature control. You can decrease or increase the temperature by 4 degree's, in 2 degree increments. Doesn't sound like much, but it can change the taste of your espresso.
Easy to program grind amount, and shot times.
It has a gauge to measure the pressure as it goes through the port a filter. It is a nice touch to be able to tell how things are working, several high price machine you have to feel it out and guess, this you can tell right away if something went wrong and you can adjust.
The steam wand is easy to use, the switch on the side is okay, my super did have a better control knob that you could control the amount of steam that came out, but this one is slow enough that its not that bad to operate.
Clean up is a snap, I really enjoy the fact that I can easily and quickly clean it up.
It has a water filter, where I live we have a high concentration of hard water, so having a second filter to go through is nice.
Parts. Breville has all the parts you can buy to fix your machine if they go out or need replaced. I am talking about new port a filters, rings, hoppers, water reservoirs, ect.
It is pretty, looks really good, makes you want to drink coffee.

The things that are not so nice:
You will go through a lot of coffee. This is most true when you first get the machine and try to figure out how to run it. There is a couple of way things can go down. 1) you drink every cup you make, I suggest you do this alone. Anyone around you will worry you are on something because you will be running at a 1000 mph on that much caffeine, no matter what your tolerance is. You will be wondering why everyone around you is moving so slow. 2) invite people over and watch there reaction to find out well you are doing on making that espresso.
Mess from the grounds. It has a tray, but for some reason my grounds always seem to go further then the tray. I placed a small dish under the grinder it that keeps it contained and its easily cleaned. You can also fill the port a filter, tamp, then fill a little more until you reach the proper level. I place a paper towel down and do the tamp on that, it catches the grounds that fall when tamping.
Don't expect a piping hot cup of joe. You can get it hot enough, by following their suggestions. I poor hot water in my cup before and do a single shot on a empty port a filter, that seems to do a good enough job.
My latte art is of clouds, mushrooms, cotton balls. I believe that is my malfunction though.

Overall, for the price (especially now) and the quality of espresso I am getting, its the top choice. Is it the best machine out there, no. But if you can afford those then I am not sure why you are reading things on amazon. Try different beans, they will taste different from what you are used to, each type will need different techniques to get the right pull. The Seattle best coffee bean, I only need to lightly tamp, the Vietnamese Civet I have to really press hard to get to the right tamp. I will trying several others as I go along, but I think that's the best part of this machine. And to the few people ( there is other things I would call you) about the California restrictions, in the manual it does say that the parts on the machine that does come in contact with coffee or water is BPA Free and there is no parts that will make you grow a third limb, unless you already have one. If you read the blasted bill you might figure out what it actually is saying, Anything with a grinder or power cord falls in this warning. I don't know about you, but I am not grinding bits of plastic in my coffee, and I am not sucking on the power cord, but if that's what you want to do, go for it.

For me, this has been a awesome buy, thank you for reading."
14,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love my coffee!!!
Tried plenty of coffee machines. Simple and keurig as well. Not the great coffee flavor you will get with the breville.
Simple. Fresh ground coffee beans. Right amount. And like a professional barista just make your fresh brew coffee. Enjoy it like an Italian !!! Same creamier coffee, great flavor like you would get on Italian ground, made by the great Italians barista.
Worth the money !!!!"
15,5.0,2022-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This thing is amazing. I used a keurig for a long time because I liked the convenience - even though the coffee tasted like hot garbage. I thought something like this would be a lot of hassle, but in reality it takes about as long to make an americano with this as it did to make a cup of coffee with the keurig. And, because I’m no longer stuck buying $30 boxes of coffee dust pods, I’m actually enjoying my coffee. I spend less, for better coffee, and its better for the environment, and just as convenient. The only downside is the initial cost, but in reality, I think it will pay for itself in a year given how expensive keurig replacement pods are. I can’t think of a downside."
16,5.0,2022-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Decided to buy an espresso machine and start making my own drinks instead of going to Starbucks every day. Did a lot of research and watched a lot of YouTube reviews and came to the conclusion that this was probably a good fit for me. I was not disappointed. After needing to learn how to make drinks and properly use it for a couple of weeks, I now make my own drinks pretty much every day."
17,5.0,2014-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is a learning curve with making perfect coffee, but after 2 weeks to a month the coffee will consistently come out amazing each time. I recommend using older/going bad coffee for the first few weeks to get use to the grind sizes and enough pressure pushed down on the tap.

Best advice is to always start too course with the beans and work your way finer. Also, aim perfectly for the center of the pressure Guage when brewing."
18,5.0,2022-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"One thing a lot of people are missing the most right now is their specialty coffeehouse lattes and cappuccinos. Having burned myself out on drip coffee out my boring old coffee makers our household decided it was time to take the plunge into an espresso machine.

We vacillated between many brands and options but ultimately we narrowed our choice down to machines by Breville because they provided the most versatility and ease of use. We specifically chose the Breville Barista Express due to it's smaller design

I'm going to preface this review by saying an espresso machine is one of those things that you have to do the math on to decide if it's a worthy purchase for your home, between my partner and I we typically each have two lattes a day. If we were going to Starbucks that would be $3.65 each drink...if you add that up it's $14.60 a day *muffled scream into pillow* and that's before the tempting pastries and breakfast items. Needless to say, we were prime candidates for cutting out the daily Starbucks trip and just making our own drinks.
The espresso machine is something we spent weeks discussing and researching and we finally made the decision to go with the Breville machine.

FEATURES
This unit features a grinder, multiple portafilter cups, and a milk steamer/frother wand built into the machine. The grinder has adjustments for grinding your beans to a beautiful fine powder that helps with the pressurization process needed to make espressos rich and full of crema. The grinder is a burr type that is easy to clean and easy to understand, you simply select a grind amount between fine and course and go.
The espresso functions are simple, you have two options single shot or double shot, there's a button for each corresponding type. The unit heats up quickly and provides piping hot water within 30 seconds, enough time for you to pour your milk of choice in the stainless steel milk frothing pitcher. From this point you simply turn a dial on the side of the unit to the steam function inserter your steam wand and try to stimulate the milk into a gentle whirlpool motion, this process takes less than 2 minutes depending on how hot your like to steam your milk. This milk frothing process becomes second nature after the first couple of tries. I'm happy to share that almond milk frothed beautifully. The texture and microfoam with almond milk were both perfect and delicious tasting, traditional whole milk or 2% milk works fine as well.

EASE OF USE
My partner previously worked as a barista and knew general techniques, I on the other hand had no idea how to use the machine out of the box, the included manual is both detailed and straight to the point...even if you're a complete novice you'll still be making lattes and other popular drinks in no time.
The most intimidating part was the milk frothing process, but it's consistent and predictable and really easy once you give it one or two tries.

FLAVOR
This machine makes espresso shots that rival what I was getting at Starbucks, in fact when we made our first drink we were delighted at how much richer and cleaner tasting it was compared to what we were used to getting at Starbucks. Once you make your own latte it's going to be hard to drink anything else.
We also purchased sugar free syrups on Amazon at the same time we purchased the machine, for less than $40 we were able to get a variety pack of different syrups that take these coffee drinks to the next level.

CLEANING
Cleaning is simple, the bottom drip tray comes out like a drawer you simply dump the excess water out and clean it with soap and water. The steam wand can be cleaned with a microfiber cloth and the water that comes out of the unit. After we're done making our drinks for the morning it literally takes less than 3 minutes for cleanup.

FINAL THOUGHTS
I don't typically like to splurge on appliances like this, my partner really wanted this and convinced me it was a smart buy. I'm really glad he did because it's been invaluable in our home, it's used daily and hasn't let us down. This is one of those quality of life purchases that you just have to make if you regularly drink lattes, cappuccinos or iced coffee drinks. Breville includes everything you need except for the water, milk and coffee!"
19,5.0,2022-08-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Owned since Oct. 2017, no issues yet. Avg. of maybe 2 double espressos per day, steamed milk less often, so relatively low use. We have a whole-house water softener (and 5-stage RO filter for drinking water), so scale buildup is not an issue at all. I do run the cleaning tablet when the ""clean me"" light comes on. I did descale it once so far, but might not have been necessary (eg. our electric kettle doesn't build up any scale). We only use the non-pressurized filter baskets (tried the others, didin't see the point, harder to clean).

My best advice for an easy and consistent ""Italian café style"" espresso is to get a can of Illy medium roast beans. Especially if you're new to making espresso (actually in this case you may want to start with a can of ground Illy -- still tastes great and takes one major step out of the equation, and you then know the desired coarseness for grinding your own). This gets me a great espresso every single time. With local roasts (we have several roasters in the area I'd prefer to support instead of Illy) I found it is much more finicky... can change from cup to cup, and definitely from batch to batch. While I've gotten some great espressos from locally-roasted sources, with interesting flavors, I've gotten way more poor shots. With the Breville and Illy I can make a better (IMHO) espresso than any of the local shops can manage... honestly. Mind you we live in a small college town. I guess most ppl drink frothed milk with a little coffee and don't really notice the espresso part.

Don't try to grind a double all at once... a lot of it will overflow (wasteful and messy). I grind one shot, take the filter out, spread out the grinds and give it a couple taps on the counter to settle them, then grind the 2nd shot on top of that. Makes almost no waste or mess this way. I've found that the ""half a double"" grind amount is typically one click less than an actual single-shot grind (so eg. twice at 1 o'clock for double, once at 2 o'clock for a single).

Also forget the metal ""leveler"" thing they include... it's silly. Spread the grinds out in the filter with a finger edge. If the double filter is full to the brim before packing, you're good to go. The single filter should be a little under full before packing. After packing either filter, the metal rim on the press should be even with the top of the filter (as shown in the manual). Hardest part is making sure you're not tilting the press while pushing down, as it is easy to get a ""cockeyed"" pack. Again, watching the metal rim of the press vs. the filter rim is a good way to check that.

Low pressure can be a direct result of old beans -- really. Came home after a 2-week trip once and tried to make espresso with beans from an Illy can that had already been opened (and had made good coffee before trip). Couldn't get the pressure high enough, regardless of grind size or amount, or tamping. Even tried a cleaning. Opened fresh can of Illy, et voilá, good pressure again.

I didn't find any other accessories necessary (except eventually some cleaning tablets). You will want something on the counter to put the filter on while packing (and banging it to settle grinds) -- a folded kitchen towel works well. The space under the filter allows for a wide variety of drinking vessels (whoever suggested using paper cups... really? Wasteful and ruins the taste IMHO).

The grinder maybe isn't the best -- the grind is good. and can be set very fine, but would be better to grind based on weight instead of time. It's important that the beans are fed into the grinder consistently. Make sure they're spread out evenly in the hopper, and as someone else mentioned, tapping on the hopper while grinding may help (esp. if there aren't many beans in there). You can hear the grinder sound change when it is grinding beans vs. air. Regular cleanings help as well.

This is not a great machine for serving a party of people. Unless they like cold coffee, or you serve them all individually as the coffees are ready... the first ppl you serve will be done by the time you serve yourself. It's fine for a couple of servings, but beyond that it starts to get awkward. Especially if they want steamed milk.... you'd want the double-boiler model for that at minimum.

Overall very happy with this machine. I had never made my own espresso before owning it, but I certainly knew what I liked. This machine delivered, after a modest learning curve (and the Illy beans helped a lot)."
20,5.0,2022-09-23, Black Sesame,"9/10 for overall taste of the espresso this machine can make (beans are of course an important factor in this), but the cleaning is a pain in the butt when you have to do it.

Highly recommend this for those who are on the edge and want to make iced lattes at home like I bought this for!"
21,4.0,2022-09-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We ordered this model based off of overall reviews. We were initially left disappointed when we set up our new espresso machine and found that water would not pull from the tank. We contacted Breville support and even with their assistance we were unable to get it to function. We were frustrated because we had family coming into town the following day, Amazon went above and beyond and issued us a refund and sent us a new one for next day delivery. Set up was incredibly easy and we’ve been using it all weekend. We can’t wait to do more research and get better at it.
Overall we definitely recommend this model to anyone looking."
22,5.0,2020-07-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just about drove myself insane trying to decide which cappucino machine to buy... but I'm confident I made the right choice. The clincher for me was that this gave the option of paying in 5 monthly installments without any interest, and that made it possible for me to get a machine that would have been out of my price range otherwise. I worked for 5 years as a barista at Starbucks, and had the first iteration of the Starbucks Sirena machine.. which was okay, but not nearly as good as this one. The steam wand on this Breville does a great job making dense foam that supports caramel and other goodies; and so far, having a built-in burr grinder has been fantastic -- although maybe I should note that if you were expecting the machine to grind what it needs and then produce a shot, it doesn't do that. There isn't any incorporated functionality between grinder and espresso machine; it's essentially just a separate burr grinder and cappucino machine that happen to be inhabiting the same body. I'm a little worried that the grinder will break and getting it fixed while be a nuisance (more built-in devices means more that can go wrong), but I reckon I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. I'm super impressed with the espresso this machine produces -- I've seen reviews complaining that it took a period of experimentation before learning how to use the settings to make a great shot, but I found that this machine produced exceptional shots right out of the gate with the first settings I tried. Granted, this might be because I have had a lot of experience working with cappucino machines and their settings... my first try might have been somewhat better informed than a first attempt by someone who has never used one of these machines before. Still, I think this machine wouldn't be hard for a committed beginner to learn; its ubiquity means that there are loads of instructional and tips videos on YouTube that feature this exact machine. I only have one more payment to make before I've paid this machine off, and by my estimation it has already nearly paid for itself in money saved by not buying overpriced lattes retail. Highly, highly recommend!!!"
23,5.0,2018-12-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,We purchased our 1st machine in 2008. 14 years of trouble free it finally quit working 3 weeks ago. After minimum of 2 lattes each and everyday (Pump failed) I just ordered a new one that will be delivered today.
24,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my second Breville with built-in grinder, and I love it! Using this machine is just a happy morning ritual. It's really easy to dial in a good grind setting, and the extractions are really consistent! I use it several times a day to make Americanos, and can happily say that the coffee it makes is far better than anything you'll buy from a chain coffeeshop!"
25,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I held off on writing a review for years because I saw someone saying that this machine lasts only around 2 years. This is totally not true. I purchased this Apr 17, 2017 and I am writing this Feb 16, 2020. So I'm just shy of 3 years. It still works perfectly.

I have 5 years of barista experience and have worked with Nuova Simonelli and Rancilio machines and I love this machine. I've never had any issue with it at all. I was worried because my tap water is VERY hard. I was afraid that the insides would seize up after a while due to build up but nope. I'll also add that I'm kinda lazy. I don't descale it nearly as much as I should. I think I've only descaled it 5 times in the 3 years I've had it.

I think what a lot of people struggle with is getting the settings right. Even if you've worked with espresso machines before, each one is a bit different and each type of bean is different. It took a bit of experimenting before I got the grinding coarseness, grind amount, and tamping pressure right; but once I did, it's so easy. So be patient, try different things and see what works for you.

I love the power of the steam wand. You're actually able to get good microfoam. It takes longer than commercial machines but that shouldn't really be a surprise. It comes out hot, luscious, and creamy.

Is this the best home espresso machine ever? Probably not. But unless you're a huge coffee snob and have tons of money to throw around, it's unbeatable at this price range.

Some tips:
>Don't use the auto grind dispensing setting. Not because it's inaccurate but because it will get messy as the heap of grinds tumbles down and over the edges of your portafilter.
--> What I do is I set the auto dispense to a single shot with the amount only at about 1/3 of the way turned up. I auto dispense that base amount, take out the portafilter, gently tamp down the grinds a bit, then manual dispense grinds to my desired amount. This prevents a world of mess. What's the desired amount? That's up to what you're making and with what size filter you have on your portafilter. Single, double?
--> As a general rule of thumb, on my final, full pressure tamp, I make sure the grinds are about 5mm down from the top.

>How much grind you put in and how hard you tamped it will affect the pressure reached while infusing!!
--> if your machine is not getting to ""espresso range"" pressures then don't assume it's broken! You might just not have put enough grinds in or tamped to the appropriate level. Getting it right may take some time.
--> When you remove the portafilter after infusing, the ""puck"" of espresso grinds should come away in the portafilter and be easily disposed by tapping it (with a bit of force) on the edge of whatever grind receptacle you're using. If you get sludge when you remove, you did not put enough grinds in/tamp with enough pressure.
--> If you're still struggling to get a good infusion, play with the grind coarseness setting. It's different for different beans!

>RINSE after each use! Start up a single shot without a portafilter under for a few seconds then turn it off again. Having old grinds stuck on there is gross and affects the taste of your next espresso.
--> Rinse out the milk steaming wand after use! Have a wet tea towel ready before you steam milk! Once you're done steaming IMMEDIATELY wipe down the wand (watch your hand! It's hot!) Otherwise, the milk will cook onto the wand and form a hard crust. Rinse the inside by turning it on while pointed at the tray for about 10 seconds.

>If you turn on the steam wand and it's not starting, don't panic. Be patient. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer to get going.
--> If it's really not turning on, turn it off, then check the hole. It may be blocked up with the aforementioned cooked and crusted milk. They provide you with a handy tool to clear it!

That's all for now. If I encounter any issues in the future, I will update this review to include details."
26,5.0,2022-09-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Breville Barista BES870 12/22/2020

First off I'm no expert espresso maker, 12 yrs ago had DeLonghi espresso machine and made pretty good espresso for the time, as good as many drive through stands.

Well because of different work hours I just didn't have the time to use machine so went to drip machine.

Well my Son in law bought me a DeLongh ECP 3220 and even though it used Pressurized baskets it was ok espresso and I was hooked again and wanted a better machine.

I was looking at the Solis Barista Perfetta and a Eureka Mignon Notte Espresso Grinder at $708.00 on sale, but also had been looking at Breville Barista BES870 which had a lot more support on YouTube and internet then the Solis.

Picked Breville Barista Express on sale for $599.00 on Amazon.

There is a learning curve on pulling the right shot for the right coffee, on non pressurized baskets, I've only had my machine for five days.

I have found some coffee like Starbucks Winter roast I can pull a better shot with the Pressurized basket then with non pressurized basket (still working on this), with non pressurized basket I've got it down to a light sour taste, but once mix with milk in latte it was good.

I've found it easier to dial in my LavAzza Dek Decaf coffee, next coffee will be a local roasted Sumatra coffee.

There so much you can do to dial in your coffee with this Machine, shot time, Temp and grind, sometime it can be overwhelming, my advice is to write down, coffee name and type, grind settings, how much coffee in and how much coffee out till you find the right Balance. Remember you could do everything right and still pull a bad shot, do it again everything the same and get a great shot, remember this is an entry level machine, I've read and watch video's that to to get a machine that is consistent shots one after another you will have to spend four time as much on a machine, but if you want to experiment and just starting out this can be a great machine, pretty flexible.

There are many YouTube channels like Hoon's coffee and Lifestyle lab and many others for great info on Barista Express.

My only complaint right now is Grinder retention, sometime I have 1g hung up in grinder and other times it's right on, all I can say is keep it clean.

I've not had machine long (5 days) and don't know the reliability on it, but there are so many video's on maintaining it, I would highly recommended Breville Barista Express 870. For me I'm retired and having lots of fun with it. :)

***************************** Addition to first review *****************************************

I've had my BBE for almost a year now and the more I use it the better I like it, I've watch many youtube channels about using and getting the most out of the BBE which has help.

I've gotten caught up in watching some of these channel that say if you get a Better more expensive espresso machine you will taste the holy Grail of espresso coffee and to some that might be but so, if you do milk base drinks like me you can make a not so good shoot and in a milk base drink most the time it will taste fine.

I've bought a separate stand alone espresso grinder Eureka Mignon Facile and to me the espresso using it does taste brighter and cleaner but using the built in grinder and using WDT tool with the right grind and weight and using in a milk base drink I feel there is little to no difference.

So overall I would rate the Breville Barista Express 5 Stars for people just starting out or you just don't want to spend $3000 - 7000 on a high end espresso machine, think of all the different kinds of coffee you can buy with the savings on the BBE.

These are just my thoughts about the BBE so far so good :)"
27,5.0,2022-09-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espeesso machine is the best I ever had over the last 20 years. I am espresso fan and would drive 20 mins to SB for my daily espresso. Decided to try this machine based over 20k positive reviews, guess what : it met and exceeded my expectations . Highly recommend . PS the quick start guide is very helpful."
28,5.0,2022-04-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best machine you can get for money, had 880 touch, but ended up giving it for a Christmas and stayed with this one. Love it way more and actually can contrôle it with my hands.
It’s a consumer class coffee machine that can make you a good espresso( only real reason for me). In combination with Lavazio Super Crema this small footprint beast can be dialed to create a smooth rich and strong espresso. So if coffee for you is just something a little bit more than $10 frapuchinowithtonofsugarandalmondcokamoca from a chain overpriced place with bad coffee and you need a good one and more important you know how to do it, go for it. I wosh i could put La Marzocco in my room but my small apartment not have a spot for a real one, this Breville is the next best thing."
29,5.0,2022-09-23, Black Sesame,We have owned ours since late December 2021. There is a learning curve in life. But well worth it. Love the machine. I look forward to using it every morning. We bought ours from Amazon. Don’t wait for it to go on sale. It won’t. Life is too short. Amazing machine!
30,4.0,2022-09-10, Black Sesame,"This type of coffee maker definitely requires you to learn a little bit about coffee and coffee drinks. You need to know when to use a single-walled or double-walled basket in the portafilter, and you'll need to learn a little about steaming milk for lattes vs cappuccinos if that interests you. If that's what you want, I think this is a great machine at a great bargain."
31,5.0,2020-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took a few tries for me to adjust the knobs just right, but the many available YouTube videos were very helpful. If you drink lattes every day, this pays for itself rather quickly. After the short learning curve, I am very happy with my purchase."
32,4.0,2020-12-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've now watched a whole slew of YouTube videos about this espresso machine and it's obvious that a lot of people who buy this who are extremely serious about becoming home baristas. Good for them, but that's not me. I just wanted to be able to make a good latte with minimum fuss, and this (mostly) fits the bill, although it's not exactly as easy to use as, say, a Keurig. A few things I've learned, some with the help of the aforementioned YouTube videos, in the first week of use:
- It is messy. There is no way around this. You'll get water and coffee grounds everywhere, pretty much no matter what you do. The guy whose review recommended buying a bunch of (dark colored) washcloths for various mop-up duties is a genius. We now have a drawer of dark gray washcloths under the machine to catch spills. Every day when we are finished I pull out the drip catcher and rinse it out in the sink, dry everything with the washcloth, shake out any grounds and throw it in the laundry.
- Read the directions, then read them again. We thought the machine was broken until I Googled troubleshooting and realized the reason it wouldn't grind was that the grinder basket wasn't fully seated in the top.
- One of the videos recommended letting it warm up for 20 minutes before use. I don't think this is essential for a latte, but if you drink espresso your first cup will be lukewarm unless you let the machine fully heat up (which is long after all the lights are on).
- The default recommended settings on the grinder are working like a charm, so we probably won't mess with them much. We are using whole bean Starbucks espresso.
- The manual doesn't explain the grinder mechanism very well. Basically, you rest the filter thingy on the little rubber arms, then just bump it in and release to start the grind process -- the grinder will stop by itself. You don't hold it in unless you want grounds everywhere.
- I didn't realize until watching a video that the tamper stores in a magnetized hole to the left of the grinder. Pretty cool. When you are finished tamping your grinds, the metal ring part of the tamper thing should go all the way in the basket. If the whole tamper is just sitting on top, you have too much coffee in there and it won't seat in the brewing mechanism. Dump some out, retamp, and try again.
- In case you didn't know this, a single espresso is pretty darned small, and pretty darned strong. I have been making a single shot of grounds to use with a double shot of water to make a latte. Tastes plenty strong to me.
- The inner basket thingy (yeah, I know it has a name) has a tendency to stick after brewing. Or worse, the whole basket mechanism will comes off empty, leaving a big lump of wet grounds clinging to the underside of the machine, ready to fall and go everywhere. To avoid this problem I have taken to giving the top right of the machine a good whack with my palm before removing the basket, and this (mostly) solves the problem. If it doesn't, put the basket back on, whack the top, and try again. Yeah, it's a pain.
- You need something nearby to dump (really, whack) the grounds into. They make little knock boxes for this purpose (some of them cost more than a nice coffee maker) but we don't have one yet. My husband promises to make one, but in the meanwhile I have been whacking the filter thingy against the side of the trash can and/or digging the grounds out with a spoon. Another pain.
- It's not smart enough to know when it runs out of water and will try to brew anyway. Don't let this happen. Same with the grinder.
- I have not been brave enough to use the steamer, so I can't really add any tips about that. Instead, I microwave my milk for about a minute before adding the espresso shot to it. So sue me, I'm not a purist.
Other than these fairly minor gripes we are generally pretty happy with our purchase. Over the long haul this may save some money that would otherwise go to Starbucks, and we'll have great coffee a lot more often. I am a bit concerned about the grinder failing prematurely, as a number of reviews have mentioned, but we haven't had it long enough to know if that will be an issue."
33,3.0,2022-09-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"(First image: my machine disassembled, waiting on parts. Second image. Replacement pump from Amazon. Thanks Mr Bezos..monopoly or not, your Amazon empire helps me greatly!)

If you would normally spend $3-4 on a latte or espresso drink of some sort from your local coffee shop, then this machine will pay for itself in less than one year. If you learn how to pull clean shots, use freshly roasted coffee, and learn to texture milk decently, you WILL be able to make quality espresso drinks with this machine, hands down. As many espresso machine reviewers will point out, someone could use a $10,000+ machine and if they don't know what they're doing, their espresso shot will taste like burnt dirt.

So, thus the three stars. If this is your only objective: make espresso drinks at home for 1-2 people (because it's a single boiler and you can't pull a shot and steam milk at the same time, plus the steam power is just OK, taking 1-2 minutes to steam milk for one drink), save money by not buying a daily $3-4 drink, then this may be a perfect machine for you...

BUT, beware that this machine is not future-ready. I have owned this machine now for 4 years, so I have gotten my money back several times over, but I am have also really become excited about espresso and how to take my espresso shots to the next level, make excellent microfoam milk and make drinks for a party of 6, 8, 12. This machine will not cut the cheese.

And to add insult to injury, my Barista Express just died. Within a week, the shot pull button started buzzing and now I can't pull a shot, can't steam milk, can't even get a cup of hot water. All signs point to a bad solenoid valve or a bad pump or both.

Good luck getting a solenoid valve assembly for this machine. I am actively trying to do just that. I found the pump here on Amazon, and although I have an engineering background, I think anyone can take this machine apart if they are so inclined to give it a try. It's not that hard. But you have to have the parts to fix it. The solenoid valve assembly is apparently special order from a third party seller. I tried calling Breville and was promised a call back in 1-2 hours, but never received a call back.

So, where does this leave me? Well, with a $700 machine that I may have to toss or send to Breville to fix for $500 (an outrageous proposition, given that the entire machine costs $700, the pump is $40 and the solenoid assembly is $60...if I can ever get my hands on a replacement part). I am the guy who would buy an espresso drink every day, so I got my money's worth. But no one wants to feel like that's all they get out of a $700 investment. I encourage you to contemplate the same before you purchase this machine.

I will update here if Breville ever calls me back and if they offer a reasonable solution to fix my broken machine...To all those with working Barista Expresses, pull a shot for me. For all of the 8,000 plus positive reviews, I was one of those too until my machine broke. I'm curious how long many of those reviewers have owned their machine. I should also add that I am meticulously OCD about taking care of my machine...I flush the group head after every shot. I clean the steam wand meticulously after each steamed cup of milk. I use only bottled spring water in the water tank. I clean regularly with original Breville cleaning tablets and I still regularly change my charcoal filter even though I use spring water...the machine will fail with time, and it should be able to be fixed easily like every other quality espresso machine brand that I am now coming to learn about.

UPDATE: Breville did call me back, After posting a message on their online chat. No one specifically return my phone call however. So I guess, lesson learned. Use the online chat and don’t call. If necessary, the person on the chat will call you like they did for me. The service charge to fix the machine is only $191. The service charge includes replacing the entire unit if necessary. To Breville’s credit, they were helping me arrange for service well past 8 PM. They also pay for shipping of the unit to Breville and back to the consumer and offer a six month warranty on their work. You literally just take the machine sans any of the easily removable parts to a UPS location and they will package it up and send it at no cost to you. That is pretty excellent customer service.

I honestly think that this is pretty reasonable. If the pump and solenoid valve assembly together are about $100, then I am only paying $100 to have Breville fix the machine. it would not be worth my time to take the machine apart, and worry about changing the parts out for $100. I put the machine back together in about 15 minutes and I am shipping it off to Breville to be fixed. I guess all of this does go to show you that Breville stands by their products. However, my point about this machine not being appropriate for high-volume entertaining still stands. If that may become your goal, the dual boiler Breville machine might be the right ticket for you."
34,5.0,2022-07-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What I like: I've dove into reviewing different expresso machines this past several weeks. If you want the short version then this is it....The Breville Barista Express at $450 that I paid, is an absolutely fantastic machine. It makes a great expresso, it's easy to use, easy to clean.

What I don't like: at this price, nothing really. Perhaps I wish the steamer wand is of no burn design. As is it gets hot and mild scorches on it with every use. You have to clean it with a wet towel with each use.

Overall: My research into the best expresso machine led me from the POD based machines such as Nespresso, etc, to $9000 La Marzocco machines. First, the POD machines, especially the Nespresso ones, make a really good, consistent expresso. It's quick. It's pretty cheap. It's simple. It's easy to clean up. If this sounds good to you, stop and get a Nespresso Classic machine. If you want a great expresso, you have to go further.

I find the expresso world is like the wine world. People taste all sorts of flavor such as nut, vanilla, etc in their expresso. I tried, but frankly I can tell if I like the expresso or not, but my palete is pretty average and those super refined flavors escape me. I'm the same with wine. If it taste good, it taste good. But I'm not able to locate which region the grapes came from. And frankly it doesn't matter.

OK....the super expensive machines...the group 61 based machines go up to $4K easily. Others such as the La Marzocco machines go easily to $9k. And yes, they make a FANTASTIC expresso.....90% of the time. You have to be an artisan to really get the most out of these machines. If you don't get it just right, it's average at best. For the home owner, the Breville makes just below fantastic 99% of the time. The expensive machines are usually based on boilers, which takes 30 minutes to heat up. Their steam function is more powerful. They are well built and they look like art in your kitchen. But for an average person like myself, I can not make a better expresso on those machines than I could with the Breville. The Breville heats up in about 30 seconds. It's built in grinder is plenty good and is consistent. Once you get the finess of the grind, the amount of grind, and learn to tamp correctly, everything else is pretty much idiotproof. The machine pre-saturates the grind, then builds up to the appropriate pressure. I find the steam function more than adequate. At first I'm put off that the machine can't make the expresso and froth milk at the same time, but after using a friend's dual boiler, I don't think its a factor at all. The thought is that if you froth the milk while the expresso is brewing, then both will be done at the same time and nothing gets cold. Reality is that the 30 second it takes to change from expresso to frothing function, makes no noticeable difference in temperature to me.

If you have lots of friends over and make multiple drinks, then the Breville Barista Express is a bit limited. This is because you make the expresso, change to steam for the milk, then when you change back to make another expresso you have to wait just a bit for it to cool down. If you do tend to make several expresso at a time, consider a dual boiler version of this machine or get the Delonghi version that also has the dual boiler function.

In conclusion, I thought I had to spend thousands to get great expresso..this Breville is much more advanced in technology than thousand dollar machines, and makes better expresso most of the time. It's an unbelievable value at $450!"
35,5.0,2022-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bro, like…no cap. This is hands down one of the, if not THE, best purchase of my SO’s and my life. This bad boi blends. I love the sleek look. It’s easy to clean and the instructions are clear and defined. One thing I will say is that…sike, I don’t think there’s a negative thing I can say about this purchase. Lol we’ve had it for months now and it’s still going strong and running like new.

If you’re anything like me and buy coffee religiously at Starbucks or your local coffee spot, this is a MUST HAVE.
Yearly we were spending about $4,300 a year on lattes out. About $12 a day for two lattes.
Once you get the initial cost out of the way we’re saving AT LEAST $3,500 considering we buy our local beans, oat milk, paper straws, cups, etc. Think of it as you basically paying yourself to make your coffee lol
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS.

Tl;dr
Pros:
Easy to clean
Style/look
Well written instruction manual
Bean capacity
Water capacity
Value
The only person that can mess up your drink, is you! Not an, unfortunately, underpaid barista.

Cons:
(Not really a con) there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to how much espresso you want grounded, but I believe in you ;) you’ll figure it out"
36,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my first Espresso machine. It’s definitely well made and makes making great cappuccinos easier. The investment for me was not insignificant. And I wasn’t sure just how well all would go. I am super happy, but if I were to do it again - wife permitting, I would splurge for the Breville BES920XL Dual Boiler Espresso Machine, Brushed Stainless Steel. It’s, unfortunately a thousand dollars more. But the benefits of things like a dual burner….

Anyway, this one makes my cappuccinos just like the ones I got hooked on in Italy. Now I just need to find a good decaf whole bean coffee. I haven’t slept in four days!"
37,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased two of these for both houses. Every time I make guests coffee they end up purchasing one too. Makes great lattes. Grinds the beans and steams the milk to perfection. A little loud when someone is sleeping, so we keep it in our laundry room behind the kitchen. It will wake other people up in the house"
38,5.0,2022-09-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine has been easy to use with great tasting results. There was an initial issue with low pressure, but after a quick YouTube video, I was able to change the internal grind size (was super easy to do) and it has performed wonderfully since. Very satisfied with this espresso machine and the drinks I have been able to make."
39,5.0,2022-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I rarely write online reviews of products I buy, but I am so impressed by this machine I must share with people who are contemplating this purchase.

BOTTOM LINE:
This is an extremely good value for the price, and I would HIGHLY recommend this machine to anyone regardless of their experience level with making espresso-based beverages. Read on for more detail...

BACKGROUND:
I am very careful when buying products in this kind of price range, and thus do a lot of research before buying. This is especially true with something you can't truly ""try before you buy"". I read over 100 of the reviews on this product, and although there are some complaints the major theme is very positive. I have been using the Breville daily now for almost two months and feel I understand it's pro's and con's very well.

As a coffee person, my focus is on espresso, Americano, and lattes. I was never a drip-coffee person, but I have been a hardcore Starbucks latte guy for 6 years. I have talked at length to baristas over the years to get a more technical understanding of what makes great coffee, and previously owned a fully automatic machine from Saeco (about a $600 machine). When it came time to buy a new machine, I felt that I was ready to make the jump to a semi-automatic machine.

Lastly, I come from a technology background (e.g. Apple employee) and feel that I am a good judge of design, manufacturing, user interface, etc.

DESIGN:
This is an extremely well designed product. Every little detail, from the exterior & interior packaging to the controls on the front of the machine, is very thoughtfully done, well executed, and serves its intended purpose. From the beginning you see that it is a high quality product, and Breville spent money where it matters. The materials are visually appealing as well as sturdily built, with the kind of craftsmanship and heft you would expect from a much higher priced machine. Nice touches like having the tamper store in a magnetized hole in the top of the machine, having the top surface of the machine stay warm from the boiler to keep your portafilter and coffee cup warm, and creating a hidden accessories tray in the base of the machine are signs of top notch designers. Overall, the product is relatively compact and will fit into any size kitchen situation. Lastly, the user instructions are extremely well done and very helpful - READ THEM.

PERFORMANCE:
The espresso produced is extremely consistent, and only changes as your beans age (although a pretty small difference). The water boiler heats up very quickly and you will be drawing a shot less than 2 minutes after hitting the power button (part of this time is grinding the beans). The controls are easy to use, and the movable items such as the portafilter and steamer wand are holding up well and I have zero concern about long term reliability. The steamer wand, compared to my previous Saeco, seems to create much richer milk foam, which is important for lattes and cappuccinos. There are a number of ""complaints"" from people on these reviews about how difficult it is to get good espresso, but I can tell you my very first shot was good and has been ever since. I think these people are creating the wrong impression, as this machine is incredibly easy to use. However, it's critically important that you read the instruction manuals FIRST to help ensure you get it right. The grind level is the only thing you really need to set, and that will be personal preference to some extent but for my beans it seems best at 4. The other thing you control is how hard to tamp the grounds in the portafilter, and I will tell you that if you give it a good strong press (I use two hands on a hard flat surface), it will be just fine. Don't overthink this machine!

BEANS:
I strongly suggest you find a local shop that roasts their beans on-site so you can have truly fresh beans. You want espresso whole beans, and they need to be 100% Arabic and NOT the ""oily"" kind. Otherwise, you will gum up your grinder.

CLEANING:
Terrific design makes this a breeze to clean. The water and grounds catch tray just lifts out in one piece, and you can take everything to the sink without making a mess. A quick rinse and you are ready to put it back. One thing that cannot be avoided is that some of the coffee grinds will spill out of the portafilter during the grinding process, and may even fall off the coffee maker and onto the counter (or floor). I shake the portafilter mildly while its grinding to even out the grounds to minimize the mess, but even that doesn't eliminate it completely. The other mess creator is tamping the grounds and levelling off the dose size, this will cause grounds to be spilled. Up to you how to contain this, although I just turn the dosing blade upside down and use it to scrape the grounds off my counter and into a bowl I use to catch the grounds when I level the dose. Overall it is quite minor and requires less than 5 minutes of clean-up a day."
40,5.0,2019-11-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Its my first espresso machine havent had any issues with it in the year plus I've been using it. Sometimes I cant get it to pressure with prepackaged beans but its never happened with anything fresh from the local roaster. Not sure whats up with that Im not a coffee guru. Cleaning and maintenance are quick and straight forward. Because the tops heated my cat likes to sit on top and that lead her to find out she can play with the water tank which I wish latched or something but I guess thats only a problem if you have animals that like to put their paws where they dont belong.
41,5.0,2020-10-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this espresso maker. Coffee is delicious and it is easy to use. I don’t go to Starbucks anymore. Cleaning is a little time consuming but nothing I wasn’t expecting. I make several drinks daily. Love this machine.
42,5.0,2019-08-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Consistent flavor. Easy to use and clean. This will pay for itself as it gives a better espresso shot than what you pay $$ for at well known coffee shops. Use to drop alot of money buying coffee drinks. No longer do that as this little machine and Monin syrups makes a much better one!!!
43,5.0,2022-06-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First of all, do the math and confirm how much cheaper is taking great coffee when comparing to Keurig's dirty-water-coffee.

- A 2.2 lb package of Lavazza Super Crema Whole Bean Coffee Blend costs $15 on average.
- It takes 7.5g of ground coffee to prepare a single shot espresso.
- You can make ~130 single espressos with that.
- Which puts a single shot espresso around $0.11 cost / unit.

- A Keurig pod costs no less than $0.50 / unit.
- Now imagine this case scenario: 2 coffees a day during 30 days.
-- This machine will set you back $6.60.
-- While the Keurig machine will set you back $30.
-- Using this machine for 24 months, saving $23.40 / month in coffee, you can pay this machine in 30 months: assuming you're paying the $699 regular price. If you buy this machine for $540 like I did, it will be paid off in 23 months.

Now talking about the learning curve...

It took me a few days, lots of frustration, tons of mess, 1lb. of coffee and 1/2 gallon of milk to learn how to make a decent latte.

Did it payoff all that suffering? Oh, yeah, you bet!!! I'm now able to make such a delicious, flavor rich, not bitter at all cup of latte. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.

These are the tips that made all the difference for me:

1. You want to use the single walled filter to get a real espresso with real crema. The double walled will give you a crappy, Keurig like cup of coffee.
2. Set the grind size to 5, grind amount to 3 o'clock.
3. You don't have to use force on the tamper, you just need to compact the ground coffee to make it look: compact.
4. You don't have to use the precision trimmer.
5. If you don't get the right pressure (see the manual for a perfect extracted espresso), keep grinding more coffee and trying again without changing the settings. It feels to me the grinder has to run quite a bit until it reflects that grind size 5 setting.

Frothing milk is trial and error to the extreme. What worked for me:
1. Pre-heat the steam wand until the light stops flashing and you hear the pump working.
2. You have 8 seconds to turn the steam wand off, insert it into the milk and turn it on again.
3. Always use cold milk.
4. If you want to prepare a 5 floz. latte, that's about 1 floz of espresso and 4 floz of frothed milk. Looking inside the pitcher, that's about halfway from its bottom to the bottom of the V shaped poorer.
5. Insert the steam wand 1/4 of inch into the milk. Play with the steam wand beforehand to find out all the angles and positions you can use to achieve that.
6. Position the pitcher in such an angle to allow the milk to spin like a whirlpool.
7. When the pitcher is too hot for you too touch, keep the steam going for another 5 or 8 secs to get the milk in the right temperature.
p.s. The temperature of the latte will be the temperature of the milk. Unless you want to pre-heat the cup before the whole process, you want the milk as hot as possible, but not so hot that it will alter the taste of the drink.

Everyday usage:
1. Wait 20 min or so for the machine to pre-heat.
2. Check the level of beans and water: the machine won't tell you when there's not enough beans or water.
3. Flush the portafilter before the first espresso: see the manual.
4. Keep everything clean after preparing each drink.
5. Empty the water/coffee tray before that ""Empty me"" sign pops up to avoid a big mess."
44,5.0,2022-08-02, Black Sesame,"Read alot of reviews, my Boss purchased and loved it so much, he stated he threw his Starbucks down the drain! I purchased for my husband, he is so happy and will not go back to Starbucks! Only makes 1 cup at a time, extra work, grinding and more steps making a cup of coffee BUT so worth it! I love SPOILING my husband! Thank you, Breville."
45,4.0,2022-09-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,It takes about 10 minutes for it to warm up. I don’t know why the button to turn it on needs to be so loud to wake up the whole house. I want to have it ready to make a cu when my partner wakes up but it’s so loud just turning it on that I can’t.
46,5.0,2022-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Follow up: Oct. 2019,
Still going strong. No issues with the machine to date. Still looks great, works great. Daily use, 2-3 cups a day. Thousand+ cups made. I have been cleaning it regularly and descaling about every 6 mos (not hard water area). I have cleaned the grinder once and even that was probably not necessary. I didn't find a lot of buildup on the burs. I only grind fresh roasted unflavored beans, I was kind of surprised to not find any buildup on the burs, but hey, I'm not complaining. I would definitely buy this again.

Original Review:
A fine machine for the cost. I was not sure what to expect, but this thing is nice. For a home machine it kicks out a nice cup-a-joe!
Bottom line, this is a great machine. I have tried several and so far, short of a commercial unit, this is the one to get.

Not an automatic coffee maker. You have to learn how to use it. But if you are like me and don't mind a little hands on, and a little thinking you will love this machine. If you are looking for a 'push the button and have a cup of espresso', look elsewhere. You will need to adjust and adapt to the coffee beans you choose.

Pros:
Pump is powerful. Have not had any issue getting excellent extraction.
Heater is powerful. Heats up fast and not much waiting at all for a single boiler unit. I was initially debating on getting the dual boiler unit since almost all I make is cappuccino type drinks. However, the wait for steam is only about 10-15 seconds and at this point I can't see spending the extra cash. Plenty of steam!
If you like hot milk, or lots of foam, or somewhere in the middle, you are set. Once you get the hang of the steam wand, it is no big deal to make it how you like it.
Construction is solid. Materials seem high quality and sturdy. Has a good feel.
Grinder works just fine. As long as it doesn't break, we're good. The grind is consistent. I have used store bought and fresh roasted (same day) coffees. All grind just fine and make a good cup. I don't use the pressure filter, but have tried it out on some pre-ground coffee. It does fake out a nice crema. So if you don't want to bother with fresh beans and proper grind, you can still get a nice looking cup.
It is not 'automatic' as in brainless. One still needs to get the right grind and tamp for the beans you are using, but for anyone with a tad of experience you will be proudly sipping your efforts in no time. I find the results very consistent and repeatable. Once you are dialed in for a batch of beans, you don't need to mess with it.

Cons:
Mostly nits but some may find them more annoying...
The drip tray fills up very fast and if you wait for the little 'empty me' flag you waited way too long. Prepare for a mess. Just stay on top of it.
There are lots of crevices in the drip tray that you will never get clean. OCD people will not like this, but it's nothing you see and won't affect the operation at all.
The grinder does not feed itself well. It will run dry with beans in the hopper. You have to tap it or stir the beans to get them to drop in. Not a big deal though.
It is a tad on the messy side, but I really don't see any way around this. You will have grounds and drips and stuff around the work area. Again, I don't see any way to load the filter without a bit of a mess, but just know this is not a clean freaks operation.
You will have a perpetual gob of steamed milk on the steam nozzle in the little flat area that is there to thread it together unless you scrape it out every time. It's just a little space but again, if you are the OCD type you will notice it...
The drip tray finish scratches easily. Don't expect the work surface to stay pretty long. It will show use. No harm. Just not new looking...

Wish List:
I wish it had an option for a water line and a drain tube.
I wish the finish was a little more fingerprint and scratch forgiving."
47,5.0,2015-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just to couch this right...we are coffee snobs.
We buy fresh-roasted beans (Ruta Maya Whole Bean Organic Coffee Dark Roast), we use a French Press to make our morning coffee--actually, own 5 of them and a Moka pot. We've been looking at automated espresso machines for about 10 years, but the price was higher than we were willing to pay for automation, especially when others we know had multiple mechanical failures with high-quality brands.
I watched a number of videos related to making espresso with these machines, then discovered the Breville BES870XL Barista Express. I was a little skeptical of the process, thinking I am too busy; however, I found the craft interesting so I decided to dive in.
The machine has been easy to set up, easy to manage, easy to use. We follow the manual and do all the cleanings when prompted.
My 18-year-old is doing a gap year before college and he watched the videos and is now all in and able to make great espresso drinks with great crema and sweet tasting espresso. We now make these espresso drinks at home: espresso, americano, flat white, cafe' mocha and cafe' latte.'
The Unit:
It is compact, fits nicely on a typical counter underneath a cabinet. It has nice quality cords, handles, and accessories. It isn't connected to a water supply, so you need to remove the water bin (has a handle) to go fill it up. We keep a water pitcher with a funnel nearby to lessen the need to remove the water bin on the back. You need to empty and clean the tray at the bottom (we do it about twice a week). We placed ours on a countertop about 4 feet from our sink on a dry use cabinet near our refrigerator with a filtered water tap.
Our Use:
We've now owned it for over 4 months, including two automated cleaning cycles (with tablets) and have had no mechanical failures, but we are diligent about the hygiene of the group head. We make about 3-10 Espresso drinks every day, as a family of three. We hit our ability stride in about a day. We watched a bunch of videos to make sure we understood the machine and the craft.
We have a knock box, but we use it to store a few items. Instead, we knock the pucks in the sink (disposal) hitting it against a soft plastic DANCO disposal stuffer/guard  DANCO Disposal Genie Garbage Disposal Strainer and Splash Guard, Red (10451) . This item is nice and soft so it won't hurt the portafilter when you knock it.
To fill the water bin, we use a 1-liter water carafe (with chalkboard label) like this one:  Anchor Hocking Water or Wine Carafe, 1 Liter with Chalkboard Label (Pack of 2 Bottles with Chalkboard Label) . We got a set of two for about $6 at our local supermarket/grocer. We also purchased this espresso shot and measuring glass set on Amazon ( Espresso Shot & Measuring Glass for Baristas 2oz 1,8 x 1,8 x 2,6 inch for Single Shot of Ristrettos and Espresso ) which we use, but beware, you can lose some crema when you pour out of here into your cup.

This machine is for you if:
- you like coffee drinks,
- you like the art of making things,
- you are okay cleaning and managing things,
- you think coffee puck machines were forged in the fires of hell,
- you already enjoy making coffee with a French Press,
- you enjoy the sweetness of the crema on top of an espresso,
- you love espresso drinks.

This machine is not for you if:
- you aren't fastidious,
- you don't enjoy managing and maintaining your tools,
- you think Keurig drinks taste good,
- you have no taste buds,
- you think Starbucks and Peet's coffee taste burned,
- you get your ""good"" coffee from McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts.

We enjoyed the Breville quality so much we also bought their countertop oven when our previous toaster oven died.

48,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am very happy with the results once I.....

I do suggest reading some of the other reviews to know what other better quality and more workable accessories you should buy to make your preparation much easier. For example a scale that weighs in grams, a better height adjustable tamper puck, a hands free dosing funnel and more. See bottom links.

Just as important as the espresso machine is a real home/professional espresso grinder for best results.

I purchased the Breville Barista Express with the built in grinder. The built in grinder does a lousy job grinding for espresso. More specifically the grinder in never consistent. Same bean, same settings, nothing touched, and yet a different consistency of grind each and every time. I thought my head was going to explode!!! It was impossible to dial it in. I was ready to send back the Breville unit. Had I known this when I purchased it I would have bought the cheaper Breville BES840BSXL Infuser Espresso Machine without the grinder.

I did my research and found out other folks who have bought the Breville BES870XL Barista Express to brew espresso also had the same grinder problem. One gets what one pays for obviously. I noticed in many of the videos that I watched, users looking to get the best espresso out of their Breville Barista Express machine use a separate dedicated espresso bean grinder. I thought why not try that approach first before returning the whole espresso machine and starting from scratch.

I quickly learned is if one wants great espresso, one needs a great espresso grinder. It's really as simple as that. Spend the money, get the consistency, it's well worth it.

After reading many reviews I settled on the Baratza Sette 270. The Baratza Sette 270 is the least expensive yet best quality grinder for grinding espresso perfectly and consistently from grind to grind for the money. It is able to extract / grind the finer flavors from the beans that lessor grinders can only dream about.

Yes, I am very happy with my purchase and consistency of both my Breville and the Baratza Sette 270 grinder.

(Because I knew I would only use this Baratza to grind espresso, I did add the 2nd (included) shim to the base of the conical grinder. I read many users recommending to do this, so I didn't wait and just did it from the beginning.)

I read the Breville manual to learn how the machine operates. I watched many videos to learn how to dial in my new Breville Barista Express machine on Youtube for optimum results. I spent many hours applying what I learned into practice and....

CONSISTENT SUCCESS!
I am now dialed in on my dedicated espresso grinder and am now able to pull the following shot consistently ""the first time and every time"" and the taste is really delicious. 17.5gm beans, medium roast, perfectly and consistently freshly ground espresso, perfectly tampered, 194F brew temp, 4 second pre infusion, 27 second water flow after infusion, 35gm of brewed espresso, beautiful crema on top. Stir with silver spoon, (not born with it..), taste, mmmmm oohhhh yum...

For me that's hitting the espresso jackpot each and every time!
What about you?
Are you interested in dialing it in too?

49,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wasn’t going to leave a review but then I read a few bad ones. So thought I’d share my experience. I bought my coffee machine in 2017, I’m still using the same one! It has lasted 5 years and I am so nervous it’s going to quit on me that I ordered a new one. I highly recommend!"
50,5.0,2022-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to clean , I use it everyday . Make sure you do it correctly & it makes awesome expresso"
51,5.0,2022-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this Breville 870 machine now for 2.5 years and I have yet to see another machine for under $1000 that I would prefer. This is my third espresso machine (in about 23 years of making espresso and 20 years of roasting coffee) and it is by far the best I've had. It still works the same as it did when I bought it. (I am much better at making espresso than I was then due to this machine.)

It is still surprising to see the mid-high end features built into this for the price. The two biggest surprises to me are the quality of the grinder and the PID controlled thermo-block. The grinder performs similar to those in the $200 to $400 range. I very much doubt you will find a better espresso grinder for under $200 (and you'll probably find some lesser grinders for over $400 - yes, just for the grinder). I haven't checked in a while, but I don't know of any other espresso machine under $1000 that has a PID controlled thermo-block, let alone having both that AND a great grinder. Those two items are VERY important in creating a great espresso.

I like to have the control to customize my espresso - especially since I usually have 3 or 4 unique origins roasted at any given time and love variety from day to day - even shot to shot. The pressure gauge is a necessity for this. It helps you see the result of the grind, tamp, etc. and tune in the brew process you want. Breville even lets you control the temperature of the PID controller and the shot length. I'm pretty sure you'd have to spend a lot more money to get more control than this (like manual pressure regulation, pre-charge timing, etc.)

If you don't want to learn anything about making espresso, this might not be the machine for you. I think Gaggia makes something better for under $1000 for those that just want to put in beans and push a button. This is my third machine and it still had a learning curve for me because I'd never had that much control before. Now I would never turn back and would greatly miss that control.

Is it perfect? No. No espresso machine under $1000 will be - probably ever - but I'm not sure how you'd get closer to perfect for this money. It has several other features that are very nice that you can see in the product description. I've been an engineer for 25 years and I can see that a LOT of thought was put into designing this, especially at this price.

As others have noted, this is not an industrial machine for a coffee shop, but you could definitely have a party with friends and make serious cafe quality drinks for them if you learn how (even better than many cafes if you use fresh roasted high quality coffee). I've done that with a much lesser machine. Note that I usually don't pull more than about 3 shots a day, so I don't use it heavily on a regular basis and can't say I've proven it to be a heavy duty machine. If you are usually only pulling a few shots a day, this should last for years to come. Just clean it as the directions tell you to.

If you want to learn about espresso and continuously perfect and customize your shots, but don't want to spend thousands, I believe this is THE machine to consider."
52,5.0,2022-08-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had a few cups from this machine at a friends house and was hooked instantly. My wife wasn’t thrilled when I snuck this purchase in, but after a few days and the 180° difference from our Keurig mornings, she is hooked like me.
I’m no Espresso machine expert or engineer for that matter, but I can hold my own on instinct with well built machines. I did not do much research honestly to compare the espresso quality vs $ value for the cost…I had several cups from this and that was all I needed to know. It’s better than the nespresso coffee in my opinion, and honestly cheaper due to the cost of those pods.
Bottom line, maybe it’s OCD but I love the process from end to end in making my latte/americano every morning. The crema is insane and presses well from every bean we have tried. Also OCD about cleaning/descaling and perhaps where others may encounter problems is not staying on top of this. It only takes about 10min max 1x monthly and is honestly gratifying. Also after each coffee/steam usage a quick wipe down/wand clearing is easy and necessary.
It’s easy to use and low maintenance, and long term cheaper than Keurig/Nespresso etc etc if you consider the pod cost. 5* for the great espresso, experience, quality, ease, value."
53,4.0,2020-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this espresso maker. Everything is great especially the grinder and the top cup warmer. The only thing I wish was better is the steam/hot water knob. It takes STRENGTH to turn this thing. Sometimes my partner has to hold the machine so I can turn it.. even he struggles. Not sure if this is a malfunction or how all of them are. Would be five starts otherwise.
54,5.0,2022-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ll keep it shirt because I could truly go on for some time about every thing that I like or didn’t like about this purchase.

Pros:
Best. Coffee. Ever. or espresso :) - the quality of brewing in this machine is phenomenal. And if your deciding on buying a new Kurig or investing in this...you won’t regret it. Keep in mind it’s a lot more to do than just dropping a cup in and pressing a button. But the pay off is so worth it. Again if you're able to deal with the process the outcome is worrh the effort.

Easy - grind beans, pat down (or don't), brew. Yes if you want creama you'll need the grind finer and if you have a wife like mine who prefers coarse ground over my fine ground there will be mistakes :) (not my fault she drinks coffee made for normal ground people) that's why there's a knob you turn boom creama turn boom regular coffee.

3. Variety - vanilla beans cool espresso beans cool mix beans cool the bean cup can giveth and taketh away. Meaning you can switch out beans whenever you want because the cup detaches, pit different beans in or whatever. No more multi pack of k cups you'll never drink but it was cheaper to buy in bulk.

Cons:

Gotta admit there's only a few that aren't really cons, they're just the reality of having a ""machine"" vs. 1 button brewing.

1. Cleaning - you gitta do it and once you do the first one it's not a big deal but I'd be lying if I told you I DIDN'T watch a few YouTube videos to get confident on what to do.the included instructions are...informative. Watch the videos save your stress.

2. Size - cup size to be precise. From the pic notice your standard coffee mug under the thing where your coffee comes out (not trying to impress you with my knowledge and terminology of every part of this thing) but standard mug I press button coffee goes in, large mug I need to use ANOTHER cup or an espresso mug to get my espresso (or coffee) and then pour it in my normal Monday morning late coffee cup. Again, not a big deal but just know that 2 cup mug isn't fitting under extractor.

3. Water tank - not that it's small and not that it matters if you have it sitting on a counter NOT underneath a cabinet.but you'll notice we have ours on a lazy susan so that we can spin machine around fill with water and spin back. It was a few weeks of lifting machine pulling it out taking stuff off the top of it emptying tray to put water in that made us go that route. If it's under a cabinet consider that. The lazy Susan spinning while lock g in extractor took some getting used to but it works.

That's it I won't go on because anything else would be nit-picking in my opinion.

Oh last thing price. Just a $100 less and this is a no Brainerd but that last $100 made us think hard about a new kurig or nespresso machine or this. Find a sale or wait for the price reduction it'll make it easier to click buy."
55,5.0,2022-09-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My husband has had this on his wish list for a while, so I bought it for him for our anniversary. He’s learning how to make yummy americanos and lattes, so it’s a win for both of us! Debated between this and the pro, but the classic look of this model won us over. Highly recommend if you are looking to make delicious espresso drinks at home."
56,5.0,2017-04-13, Black Sesame,before I got this machine I was a Starbucks queen buying one to two drinks a day (allot of money I know). This machine has been the BEST purchase of my life and will have made back it’s price in just ~four months. If you are going to use the machine heavily I do suggest getting the warranty because you just never know. A machine can only tolerate so much abuse before something is bound to happen LOL. With that being said I had a scare that Breville was able to trouble shoot and educate me on how to avoid it in the future. Big fan :)
57,5.0,2018-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It arrived this morning just in time for our first cup of the day. The packaging is very professional, although they use styrofoam, which is a shame. The quick start guide was excellent. i was able to make my first espresso in maybe 15 minutes from the time I took the machine out of the box. It takes a little practice to make good espresso. After 6 cups (not all for me), I feel like I'm getting the hang of it.

Convenience & Speed
This is not a ""press a button, get an espresso"" machine. There's a bit of prep work and some cleanup after. But I think I might actually save a minute or two vs. making brewed coffee with my Chemex.

Size & Weight
It is quite light and fits well on my little kitchen stand (see photo). In fact, it's so light that it moves when I crank on the brew basket, so I have to use two hands to secure the machine. Bigger feet could help, I suppose.

Functionality
I'm not an espresso expert, so this machine has more than enough dials to suit my needs. The grinder works well and you can adjust the quantity and granularity. The pressure gauge never quite got into the ""espresso range"" for me, but that's probably because I'm not packing my basket full enough.

Flavor
I'm amused that the rating includes a ""flavor"" component, because that's more about the 1) the operator, and 2) the beans. As an operator, yeah, miles to go. I had some old beans in the pantry so I used them. I have better beans on order, and I'm confident that they will yield better espresso (although what I made today was not bad).

Milk Steamer
It takes maybe 30 seconds to come up to full steam but the pressure is good. I like the optional water setting to warm the cup, make tea, etc.

I usually don't buy extended warranties, but I did for this purchase. I'm hoping I won't have to use it, but there are quite a few components in this thing and I've never owned a Breville product before. So far, I'm pleased. I think I'm getting pretty good value for the money. If that should change, I will update this review."
58,4.0,2021-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"*update to my review below...* Still love this machine. It consistently makes great espresso and lattes. I've however, discovered one design flaw that is really annoying and that is there is absolutely no low water indicator light. And if you like me want to use this machine on your kitchen counter where the top will be tucked underneath an overhead cabinet, you're not going to be able to see the water reservoir and tell that its low. And you shouldn't have to. A machine that costs this much should have some way of letting you know it doesn't have enough water to make coffee. What's worse is that when you do start to make coffee and there isn't enough water, the machine will just sit there for minutes trying to get enough pressure which can't be good for the pump and internal system. I'm very surprised the Breville overlooked this. One other minor complaint... there is a tools tray located behind the drip pan which is seemingly convenient but it's not because the tool tray also gets dirty water in it through normal use so you're just not going to use it so it's literally a waste. But again as per my original review, the machine otherwise is just outstanding. * Orginal review follows.... I've gone through 4 automatic espresso/latte machines over the years. The automatic machines are great when they work but so many moving that can break (i.e. to tamp/pack the coffee, extract the grounds etc..) so I started looking into a machine like this where all of that work is done externally and the machine essentially just makes espresso. So this machine got very mixed reviews and actually some pretty negative ones. But, I own other Breville appliances (my 1st convection oven lasted 11 years) so I took a $700 leap of faith knowing that I could return it pretty easily through Amazon if disappointed. And so far, I'm really liking the experience. The learning curve was not difficult at all. The machine was relatively easy to unbox and set up. And not only does it make an outstanding espresso, it does it consistently. I found that the scoop supplied with the tools provided literally measures the precise amount of ground coffee into the portafilter (for two cup brewing using the 2 cup double wall filter) that with a firm tamp literally brews the perfect espresso every time. The frothing wand is a bit different than those on the other machines I've owned but it was very easy to get used to and after a couple of lattes, I'm also making very consistent micro foam that layers beautiful in, throughout and on top of my espresso to make an outstanding latte. The espresso taste is richer and more robust than any of my previous automatic machines. I've only used ground coffee (Lavazza and Illy) so far and am very pleased. I'll try the grinder soon and expect to even make more flavorful espressos with fresh beans. I highly recommend going to YouTube and watching some of the Breville Barista series videos. There is one by an Australian Barista, where in a few minutes he'll show you exactly how to make the perfect latte with this machine. In fact, I found several really good videos on YouTube which was also helpful as I set up and started learning to use this machine."
59,5.0,2022-08-17, Black Sesame,"The reviews I found online were extremely helpful so thought it only right to post one based on our experiences so far following a purchase in February 2018.

Initial reaction - very high quality product. Heavier than I expected as well which may also have been a psychological factor that it was built well. We were switching out from a Starbucks Athena which had worked flawlessly for 15 years so clearly this machine has a lot more bells and whistles than the Starbucks unit.

First product use - I had read some negative feedback on using 'oily' beans which I thought was a bit weird given that we use very dark roasted beans (Italian Roast) that are typically oily. Sure enough, the first attempt at bean grinding was essentially a bust - so I naturally assumed it was the oily issue. Contacted Amazon who connected me to Breville immediately (e.g. 2 minute wait). The customer service rep was fantastic - had me do a grinder calibration by running rice through the machine and dialing the grind number up and down. Once that was done and the beans went back in, the coffee started grinding without a hitch! So, not an 'oily' issue. Problem number two occurred while the rep was still on the phone. I was getting little-to-no pressure on the press. The rep had me switch out the insert to help on the pressure. That problem was fixed. I immediately got a good shot of espresso (note that she said good pressure was between ""11am"" and ""1pm"" on the gauge). Next test was the foam. We use 2% milk and I was a bit worried that the small foaming tin included would overflow and generally not be big enough. Wrong. This machine produces VERY good foam and does it quickly. I had considered buying the dual-boiler so the steamer was always ready but thought about it a bit and realized we only do espresso or macchiatos so probably overkill. Right call on that. The steamer 'uptime' is less than a minute and foam is less than a minute. Excellent all around on this front.

Tweaks - we set the water temp up to max as I've historically found this to be a problem with first runs in the morning. Overall, this seems to be a good adjustment.

Still need to work on the following - 1) for whatever reason, we still get an occasional low pressure on a single or double shot - not sure why. No change in grind using the same insert. I'm convinced we're using the same amount of ground coffee and tamping it the same. But, the pressure gauge stays in the 9am range...not 11am to 1pm that the customer service rep said was in the good category; 2) I haven't spent enough time playing around with different grinds and inserts so I'm sure there is a better taste waiting at some point; 3) Size of single or double shot - these seem to be consistent and appear to be tied to the compaction of the grind - when tamped a lot, the shot runs longer but you get about the same amount of espresso (makes sense). However, I thought I read that you can adjust this flow and I'd like to do that given my preference for a longer pull of espresso. 4) we haven't done a thorough cleaning yet, e.g. full clean of the grinder, but the machine is easy to keep looking great. We make a point of cleaning/washing the water catcher immediately after use each day given that our old machine stained after years of use and lack of daily cleaning. So far - it's working.

I've seen a lot of 'tinny' products on the market and this is not one of them. I also read a lot of comments on 'perfect espresso' - seems to me that espresso is a lot like good wine. One wine - most people just know if it's good or not and whether they like it or not. This machine will be a great machine for all of you. It might be a good fit for the experts but I just don't know...I'm not one."
60,4.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Overall is a great product! easy to blend powder, make expresso and frothing milk.
However it takes some time to adjust the ground levels, need to take out the bean grounding part (and it's not easy to do) to make the extraction in the ideal place.
Overall it's fun and healing to use it to make your own coffee every day"
61,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I can't remember a time when I spent this much money on something and felt so much satisfaction to make it worth it from one use alone. Wow. I can't wait to wake up to use this every day.
62,5.0,2022-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent item!! Getting inner spare part might be difficult
63,4.0,2020-04-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,More plastic than I would prefer but it makes great coffee. I have had good espresso machines but this one had more bars of pressure so I bought it.
64,4.0,2022-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have used this espresso maker for 4 years now everyday everyday and we love it. It's coffee is even better than Starbucks. That said it does does have its issues. 1st and foremost it's grinder sucks. I clean it constantly and it still gets clogged. I'm almost at the point of buying a separate grinder.
And when you have to clean Or descale the machine it takes a while. But if you don't, the espresso maker will get clogged so you must clean it when the lights are illuminated. If you take your time and clean the machine right it will continue to give you quality coffee for some time to come."
65,5.0,2022-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really hated to spend upwards of $500 on a counter-top appliance, but I'm happy I chose the Breville Barista Express, and I think it represents a great compromise between the super expensive professional level machines and the more affordable but cheaply made entry-level machines. Previously, I was using an entry-level Gaggia Espresso Pure, and, besides being more feature-packed, the Barista Express is noticeably better made and produces better quality espresso and steamed milk. Here's what I like about this machine:
- Compact: I can't imagine fitting both a burr grinder and espresso machine in a package any smaller than this, which easily fits on my counter-top beneath the upper cabinet.
- Quality Materials: The parts of the machine that are not covered in stainless steel are made of clearly high-quality, non-brittle plastics that look like they will hold up to years of use.
- Thoughtfully Designed: The included tamper stores neatly out of the way with a magnetic hold, yet is conveniently within reach when you need it. The pressure gauge is a great diagnostic tool for the beginner, as it helps you to see when you may not have ground or tamped your espresso optimally. The steam wand has an always-cool rubberized grip that makes it safe and easy to position. This machine is filled with things like this that make it more of a pleasure to use.
- Semi-automatic: Though this isn't a machine that will grind, tamp, and brew your coffee with a single button push, it's more automatic than most machines of this class. It automatically grinds the right amount of coffee and pumps the proper amount of water for one or two shots, and you can fine tune these amounts to your needs.
- Heats Fast: This machine is ready to go much faster than my Gaggia was. It's just a matter of seconds from the time you turn it on to the time it's ready to pump hot water.
- Great Results: I consistently get better results from this than I did from my Gaggia. In particular, I'm able to achieve a much smoother and thicker texture to my steamed milk than I ever could with my previous machine.

That said, I do of course have some minor quibbles:
- It's nice to be able to grind the coffee directly into the portafilter, but some of the grounds inevitably spill out onto the tray. I solved this problem by purchasing a small, square dish for a few bucks at Pottery Barn, which I place under the portafilter when grinding. It collects any grounds that spill, so that I can scoop them back into the filter while tamping if necessary. Plus, it keeps the machine's drip tray more clean.
- The knob on the right side that controls dispensing of hot water and steam is not quite as well designed as the rest of the machine. For starters, it's a bit silly to have a big, twisty knob that only really offers three positions. A switch would make more sense. Plus, the knob on my machine can be a little sticky, with the result that it doesn't always cleanly click in and out of steam mode. In fact, when I first bought the machine, I tried following their instructions of priming the steam, then turning off the steam before inserting the wand in the milk, and then turning it on again. Several times, the steam failed to turn on again, so I started to just insert the wand into the milk while it was already steaming, and I haven't had any problems.
- When I first began using the machine, a little of the metallic paint on the plastic of the water reservoir cover rubbed off, revealing a dull gray color underneath. I'm not sure how those scratches appeared so easily, but I've been a bit more careful since then whenever I handle the reservoir, and there haven't been any more scratches. That part of the machine is in the back anyway, so it doesn't really show.

With these small complaints, my real rating for this machine would probably be 4-1/2 stars, but that's not an option, so I've chosen 5. In any case, after about three months of daily use, I can recommend the machine without reservations."
66,5.0,2021-03-16, Black Sesame,Espresso from home. Nice and strong. Great settings to be able to adjust to your taste.
67,5.0,2022-08-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"About a year ago I had the espresso bug planted inside my head. Shortly after I purchased myself a Nespresso. I was so excited--more excited perhaps than one should be. The salesman at Bloomingdales had spent nearly two hours with me going through all the machines, all the pods, all the options, the endless possibilities. Well, when I get home I realize the thing is s***. The Espresso pods are cool at first, but you quickly realize you're not really drinking legit espresso. There's very little crema, and the ""frother"" doesn't actually froth, it whisks. That perhaps was the biggest disappointment. Soy is out of the pictures since it has no fat content that can be whisked into a froth. Needless to say, the Nespresso went back to the store, and back I was at Dunkin Donuts every morning.

This went on for a while until it finally hit me that I'm wasting a grand on s***ty coffee every year. I first came across the BES870XL on Houzz, it was super well reviewed and near the top of the ""most popular kitchen accessories of all time."" Somehow I ended up on Amazon reading the reviews and I was sold.

Unpacking the Breville was eerily reminiscent of unboxing an Apple Device. Everything was packed perfectly, nothing was difficult to take apart or put together, and the U/I of the Breville was incredibly easy to figure out right off the bat. So I pull out my Lavazza beans, fill the burr grinder, turn on the machine, wait for all the lights to turn on, and finally the fun begins. To be honest, I had no idea how to get the beans to grind. I didn't even think about it, I just put the portafiler into the plastic holder, and out comes this amazing smelling ground. It didn't take long to realize that when the portafilter is firmly in the plastic holder, a little nudge backwards starts the grinding process.

I may be an amateur, but this amateur wants to go for the doubles off the bat. I used the cool blade to clean up the extra grounds in the portafilter, used the tamper to pack it all together, locked in the portafilter & pressed that beautiful blue button. And out it came. It looked beautiful, it smelled beautiful, and it tasted like s***.

Over the course of the next few days I kept having the same experience; the espresso smells & looks greats but it tastes like weak, bitter crap. A quick glance on the Breville website, and a look at some reviews on here & I began to realize what my problems were. Hopefully this will help others:

A good Espresso is only going to happen when the pressure is in the ""Espresso Range"" on the meter. Apparently, it's best if it goes to the edge of ""Espresso Range"" without going over it. My first couple of go's, I was never leaving the ""pre-infusion"" stage on the meter.

If you're using the Breville to grind your beans, make sure your not using a very coarse grind. I did this the first couple times, and apparently a coarse grind allows the water to pass through too quickly, thus not creating enough pressure to properly extract your espresso. I've found with my lavazza beans that 4-5 is best. You want your grind to be fine, but not flour fine.

In order for a good seal to be made that will allow for the pressure, you really want to try to get your tamped espresso about 1/8 of an inch from the top. It may take a few tries to get it right, but once you've got it down it's easy.

And finally; tamping. I thought you tamp that sucker with all your might. I was wrong. According to the Breville website, you're supposed to apply about 30lbs of pressure with the tamper. I didn't know what the hell 30lbs of pressure was, but I kind of imagined holding a 30lb weight, and tried to tamp like that. Low & behold, it worked. The one other thing I did, thanks to the advice of a review on amazon, was gently knock the portafilter on the counter to get air pockets out. Air pockets will cause a loss in pressure, and tamping a portafilter with air pockets will not make them disappear. If you give the portafilter a little shake & a few good knocks, you should be able to get rid of most air pockets.

I haven't had much experience with the steamer. I made a london fog latte earlier and I'll I can say so far is that the steamer works really, really well.

Overall I'm a very happy camper. Looking forward to many great years with this awesome machine!"
68,5.0,2022-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine was a bit intimidating for me. It implements the most cutting edge technology in coffee making. OK, I am just going to come right out and say it - the machine is much smarter than I am. Fortunately their customer service is very easy to reach. I had to call a few times, hysterical, because I could not get my coffee. The reps there really take the time, and patience to walk you through proper use of this machine. They really know their stuff, are friendly and pleasant."
69,5.0,2022-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far I'm very impressed with this machine. Is it a La Marzocco? No, but for this price, you can't beat it. I'm enjoying playing barista at home. This machine is an absolute gamechanger.

My in-laws have an automatic De'Longhi espresso machine and it doesn't make espresso nearly as good as this machine. I know that it's more manual, but for the person interested in pulling great espresso at home, this machine is for you!"
70,5.0,2021-07-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine but the steaming wand is difficult to clean, the grinds fall out of the tamper and the water tank is rather small, for the price. I absolutely love the end result though. I haven’t gone to a coffee shop in a long time!"
71,5.0,2018-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had this machine for about 5 months. I absolutely love it. It’s so easy to use and it makes great coffee. I’ve replace my stop at the coffee stand every morning with making my own, it has more than paid for itself!"
72,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have purchased three of these in the last six years. My son stole mine when he went to law school. His got stolen when he graduated and was driving cross Country. (Avoid the Denver metro area) I had bought one for the vacation house. We are keeping Breville in business. Fresh beans are the key !!
73,4.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Have had no issues with the espresso machine. Grinder is quiet compared to the kitchen aid grinder we had before. Very easy to use. Set up and dosing was quick and easy
74,5.0,2022-08-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have used this machine two or three times a day for the last year and a half. No problems at all. Works like a champ. Especially when family is visiting. Love, love, love this machine! If your grind is dialed in right and using great beans, the crema is amazing!"
75,5.0,2022-08-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. It is our first espresso machine and although it took some research to learn how to properly make good espresso, it has been totally worth it. Utilize YouTube for know how and it will make things easier."
76,5.0,2022-09-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had my machine for 2.5 years and have never had a problem. I was on the fence for the longest time, finally giving in after another failed americano from Starbucks. It looks complicated but actually with practice it’s really user friendly. Clean it, change the filter and descale = a good espresso!"
77,5.0,2022-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this unit because a friend had researched it and found it was a great value. It works great. It typically makes a few drinks per day.
No issues in the 6+ months we've been using it.
Our fancy coffee drink consumption has gone up a lot now that it's sitting in the kitchen."
78,5.0,2022-07-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Short: I have had this machine for 3.5 years. I use it every day, and I absolutely love it. I have had no issues with it and haven’t needed to fix anything. I would purchase again in a heartbeat.

Long: I was a barista for 3 years and basically consumed so much coffee that it replaced the blood in my veins. I love coffee. When I got a new job, I had a hard time transitioning from espresso back to your average black coffee. I ended up buying coffee almost every day (which really adds up $$$). I started researching at-home espresso machines to see what my options were. There were pros and cons to every machine. After months of research, I ended up splurging to get this machine. 3.5 years later I have not regretted it. I adore this machine. I make espresso every day, and I have brought it on vacation with friends multiple times (and even persuaded some friends to buy their own 😉). Most days I only pull one shot, but I have pulled up to 20 shots on a single day. She works like a champ. The espresso is smooth; the crema is magnificent. It’s not automatic, so you need to know what you’re doing. If you’ve never been a barista, there will be a learning curve on how to tamp, steam milk, etc. But it is so fun! If anything happens to this machine, I will definitely buy another one. It is an expensive investment at first, but I have saved almost $5000 in the 3.5 years I’ve had this machine by not going to coffee shops anymore.

Pros:
- you can remove the tamp (which is high quality). Many at-home machines have an attached tamp that is very awkward
- manual steam wand - this was a must for me. I like control on how my milk is steamed
- customizable settings - I love being able to customize the time of my shots, the grind size, and grind amount
- easy to clean - a light turns on every time she needs a cleaning :) so easy!
- amazing grinder with removable hopper
- convenient hot water spout
- helpful built in pressure gauge
- handy storage tray behind dump tray (see pictures)
- single or double shot
- everything is so high quality. The tamp, portafilter, filter baskets, milk pitcher, and the machine itself are solid and made of metal. Nothing feels like cheap plastic. I did drop the water tank a couple months ago and it cracked, but I taped it up and it works just fine!
- feels like you’re in a coffee shop, but from the comfort of your home
- MONEY SAVER

Cons:
- I wish the water tank was slightly bigger, but that would make the machine bigger
- it would be nice if it came with a knock box, but you can buy those separate for only like $15
- big investment and potential learning curve

Overall, I would recommend this machine to anyone. It’s fun, easy to use, high quality, and saves you a TON of money. It is the best machine for less than $1000. I truly will never not own this machine."
79,4.0,2017-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"On the whole, I'm very happy with this espresso machine. Once it's set up properly, it works smoothly, automating the grinding process and the water flow for shots. Getting the settings right is a pretty involved process, however. My greatest and most annoying issue with the machine is the process of clearing the CLEAN ME light. I see some people providing reviews here never resolved this issue. Here is the deal: The instructions in the manual for decalcifying are wrong. I repeated both these instructions and the process for back flushing twice. No joy. I was about to contact Breville support when I decided to check the company website first. There (under ""Troubleshooting"") you find importantly different instructions, which differ based on a four digit number embossed on the label in the underside of the machine (and this is very hard to find even when you know it's there, and even when using a magnified photo!). Based on this number, you are directed to a YouTube video (the one for my Version 2 machine is entitled ""Descaling the Infuser or Barista Express - V2""). There are crucial differences in these instructions. One relates to how you start the descaling cycle (press power holding just the 2 Cup button rather than both the 1 Cup and 2 Cup buttons, as the manual advises). I am not sure that this is what made the difference. Instead, this video advises you to remove the filter assembly entirely before starting the descaling process. When I followed the manual's directions, my descaling solution first passed through the filter. My success may also have related to my using a descaling liquid (rather than a 50/50 water and white vinegar solution, following the manual's instructions). I got two bottles of this stuff (each bottle providing two descalings) on Amazon for about $15. Another product made by Halefresh that provides 8 descalings for about the same price. After completing this new descaling procedure, the CLEAN ME light indeed went off (I put in a new filter, for good measure). I hope this helps some people."

81,4.0,2014-04-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"- Update after a year + of usage. (4 stars)

The issue was resolved although it took more than a month for the whole process. It turned out I needed to de-calcify more often since I was not using the machine daily (i.e. easier for calcium to harden). Now I do it everytime I do the cleaning with the pill.

I’ve adjusted to the machine and now I figured how to make great coffee and keep it running. However, I am still the only one in the household that can produce a good cup. My wife would rather drink instant coffee than try and learn all the quirks...

-- Update - 2 stars

After about 4 months, there was no steam and the pressure for the espresso became 0. This was poor timing too as it happened during Christmas when I had my family over. 5 stars for functionality and 0 stars for reliability. Will post another update once I see how customer service resolves the issue.

-- Original Review - 5 stars

I've had the Breville BES870XL for about 3 months now. There was a learning curve but now that I got the hang of it I am able to make excellent (much better than Starbucks) lattes and decent espressos. I thought I would the review mostly to give some tips to new users of the Barista Express in addition to the usual pros and cons.

Pros:
* Coffee taste - this machine make great coffee and at the end of the day that's what you are buying this for right? The coffee produced is much better than that produced with high end automatic machines. I've tested the Breville against an $800 DeLonghi unit, using the same beans. The DeLonghi automatic produced an ok espresso with no mess and quicker but the Breville produced a better tasting shot consistently.
* Looks - sure, there are some plastic parts but overall the unit is very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.
* Price - the unit is not cheap but it's affordable and let's you make high quality espresso. (if you stop buying Starbucks and use this machine instead, you will get your money back pretty quickly.)

Cons
* It's tough to replicate the exact same conditions every time (I will explain why) and some people may get frustrated by that
* There is a relatively steep learning curve for people like me who have not used a semi-pro machine like that.
* Compared to an automatic, it's time consuming to make coffee. Making a latte for example easily takes 3-4 minutes of busy work. Compare that to pressing a button and walking away.

Now here are the tips and things to watch out that caught me off guard in the beginning:
* To get the pressure and coffee right you would need fresh beans. Throwing in your year old beans will simply not work regardless of your grind settings, quantity of ground coffee or tamping strength. I settled on Lavazza Super Crema Espresso. It's has decent taste (not high end), ok price and freshness lasts a bit longer due to the bean treatment.
* If you are a weekend coffee drinker like me, invest in a container that is air tight where you can store the coffee beans. If you just leave them the whole week in the coffee grinder they will dry up and the pressure when making the espresso will go down resulting in a watery mess.
* Make sure you are grinding enough coffee. When tamped, the coffee should be very close to the machine. Once you get the quantity down, only then start adjusting the grind size. (if there is too much space between the coffee grounds and the machine there is no way you can get good pressure)
* Invest some time in researching and learning barista techniques. It will pay off. Prepare yourself for initial frustration until you get the hang of it.
* Because freshness of beans matters, you will rarely be able to get the exact same pressure (as beans get more stale, they soak water differently and pressure drops). Accept that. As long as the pressure is in the range you should be good.
* Forget about the programming option. Because the pressure is not always the same, it takes different amount of time to produce the same quantity of coffee (say 30 ml). Press and hold the button, that way the coffee will jut keep pouring, then press again when the desired quantity is reached to stop.
* Buy generic cleaning tablets. They are the same as the branded ones only a fraction of the cost.

Enjoy your coffee!"

83,5.0,2022-07-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I find myself making lattes at least three times a day for myself as well as for my daughter and anyone who drops over. I have learned through trial and error not to keep he lid open on the back so nothing gets in the water tank and to keep the bean level even. I have had my machine about a month now and made at least 100 cups of coffee with it.

I looked at many different machines and researched before deciding on the BES870XL. I have reached the point now where the machine has paid for itself between trips not made to my neighborhood Starbucks and the purchases I would make each time there. Now I am saving money with each cup I make. I enjoy using the frother and it works just as well on my milk as it does on my daughter’s almond or soy milk. I have experimented with different types of beans but always use a fine grind and the hopper and grinder work great. My daughter’s pre-ground coffees make a nice cup of joe just as well.

I used the monthly cleaner and ran the cycle without any problems. I am glad I bought a container for the grounds when I bought the machine because it is so nice to be able to turn the pod over and knock out the grounds, rinse it out and be ready to grind a fresh pod of beans for the next cup of espresso. Our morning routine is two cups one right after the other. I make mine before my daughter gets up since she can not stand the sound of a frother and I usually have hers ready when she walks downstairs or she is stuck with microwaved milk. It is an easy dance to go from one cup to the next and takes about a minute or so to make each cup of coffee. It is not something you bang out but rather an art form.

With the dual spouts you can do two cups side by side but if you are like me, I do four shots of espresso in my drinks so I center my cup underneath it and get a double shot and go again. The beans are thick enough I can get four shots out of one pod so I don’t need to grind more for the additional two shots. For my daughter’s double shot I could use the single shot pod twice but I simply use the double shot pod once. There is a pod that is available to allow you to do a single shot.

It also comes with a convenient tamper that hides out of the way by where the grounds come out that lets you tamp your beans into your pod; a brush to keep the grounds from getting into your cup of coffee; a convenient tool to flatten the top of your pod and other bits and pieces that come in handy.

All in all, after one month And about 100 cups I am still over the moon about my machine and drinking way too much coffee. It is a good thing I have low blood pressure!"
84,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As a bonafide coffee snob, this exceeds all expectations for flavor. Takes a bit to get the right grind settings but once you do, it’s wonderful."
85,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"I have been using the Brevill BES870BSXL The Barista Express Coffee Machine for a couple of weeks. We have very pure well water, though it is hard since it contains calcium and magnesium. This has no taste, but can affect the clogging of any water heating appliance. I mentioned this because the flavor of the espresso and the function of the machine can be affected.
I have used and reviewed several espresso machines through the Amazon Vine program and bought one other, this one I researched specifically for several months and purchased it myself. I have received for review/used mostly the cheaper units of several manufacturers, (Mr. Coffee, DeLonghi, Capresso, etc.) The comparison between this higher priced Breville and the less expensive machines is not entirely fair except on the level of taste.
This Breville machine is far beyond the functioning of any that I have had. As I learned about espresso, I mostly drink latte, and my taste has refined, the cheaper machines would not satisfy. This Breville machine makes amazingly great latte and espresso.
The biggest difference in using this machine rather than using the less expensive machines is the ability to control the strength, flavor and coffee grind; and the pressure. The flavor of my latte is not only as good as the latte purchased from the better coffee shops, it is consistently better. I had to fight to get a good flavor out of the other machines and work them to the maximum.

THE PLUSES OF THE BARISTA EXPRESS:
The beans are held in a storage unit on the top of the machine, they can be ground to powder if you desired, but it has multiple grind settings.
The water tank holds a lot of water and is easy to remove and fill or fill while attached.
The function buttons are easy to see and the functions make sense and are easy to use.
The correct amount of ground coffee goes directly into the filter basket automatically. The tamper stored under the machine by a magnet. The amount of coffee has multiple settings for both one and two cups of espresso.
The ground coffee basket holder goes into the group head with ease.
The pressure gauge lets you know the pressure of the tamped coffee being extracted with an indication of the optimum pressure point. The pressure of your tamping is a learned function by using the gauge. In this way you learn the strength of your tamp for your best espresso.
When you are finished, the machine purges itself of stream and hot water in the tray.
The streamed milk function works better than any machine I have used. Very small bubbles to big foam can be made easily. You decide what you want.
Hot water is also available on the unit.
The machine comes with cleaning tablets, tools, tamper, milk frothing cup, extra filter cups, and a place to store them.
NEGATIVES:
As far as I am concerned there aren't any. It is important to clean the milk frothing wand immediately after frothing or the milk gets hard on it from the heat, but I did not find this an issue.

Overall:
I really love the way this machine works and the espresso and latte that I can make. It makes the espresso easily and much quicker than any machine I have used. The taste and texture of the lattes are beyond compare. My only regret is that I should have got the red one instead of the black, though the black unit looks really great. I never realized that the price of the espresso machine would make such a huge difference in the quality of the espresso and the latte."

I had noticed how much she loved the latte's my daughter made on her machine so broke down and got her a machine. She uses this thing everyday! I have not heard her complaint once about it either. I don't drink the stuff so I can't give you any personal experience on consistency of the drinks produced. However, my wife apparently make great lattes with it and is pleased with the machine. Have not had any mechanical issues at all."
87,5.0,2022-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine that is worth every penny. It has transformed my mornings. I wake up wanting to make a cup of cappuccino and spend time pulling a shot or two. Fantastic!
88,5.0,2022-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First off, this looks amazing! Secondly, it works perhaps better than it looks!

I've had to call Breville's customer service twice. Both times they were professional and tried to be as helpful as they can. Allow me to explain:

When extracting espresso, I've had to set the grind to the finest setting and press the grinds down WAY more than the 35-40lbs typically claimed for the perfect extraction. The first time I called, I was concerned about this. The rep said perhaps my beans weren't fresh and/or it was as a result of putting my beans in the freezer. I'm using the freshest beans and no longer put them in the freezer but still have to press down pretty hard (50lbs of pressure perhaps) to get the espresso extraction indicator needle to move into the ""ESPRESSO RANGE"". Nonetheless, I am able to consistently produce perfect espresso for my drinks (my favorites being the easy Americana and a drink I call an ""A-Mikie-cana"" - 2oz espresso, 2oz hot water, sweetened to taste with half and half to lighten the strong coffee).

When making an Americana, I turn the STEAM / HOT WATER dial to dispense hot water prior to extracting the espresso. The machine automatically stops at the perfect amount of hot water out of the dedicated Hot Water outlet to make a double-shot American (for my taste).

Frothing/steaming milk is effortless with the 360* swivel-action steam wand. I no longer have to stand and hold the stainless-steel frothing pitcher as I can set it on the drip tray until I need to begin the frothing action. I use both a small and large pitcher (depending on how much milk I need to froth). I can pivot the wand out of my way when I need to as well. The rubber looped handle keeps fingers from getting burned!

The Grind Amount dial works well. Though I typically do 2oz double-shots, I select the SINGLE Shot button twice! After the first dosing, I tap the portafilter down to settle the grinds then tamp them down lightly with the handy removable tamper, I then dose another SINGLE grind on top (again tapping the portafilter to settle the grinds then pressing them down (harder) with the tamper - I find there's less mess and waste from grinds spilling over as is typical when selecting a DOUBLE).

The removable drip tray is convenient and easy to clean. When I first saw the ""EMPTY ME"" floating indicator on the tray, I thought it was silly. I rely on it now.

One of my favorite aspects of this machine is how quickly it is ready to make coffee! 34 seconds after hitting the POWER button it's ready to dispense hot water or extract the perfect espresso! (I timed it :-)

Everything about this machine screams quality. It automatically lets me know when it's time to clean the Group Head.

I've owned a couple different espresso machines (my last one I bought at a yard sale for $5 and used it for 6 years). I had never owned an expensive one before now. I decided to spoil myself and go Top Shelf. After some research and reading reviews, I choose this model and saved a few $$ by buying a refurb'd unit. NO REGRETS. I use it EVERY DAY. Sometimes a few times throughout the day.

All of my friends love the coffee I serve. One self-proclaimed coffee aficionado (fancier term than ""coffee snob"") told me he doesn't even enjoy the coffee he makes for himself at home now after drinking one of my Americana's (either a double-shot or a quad-shot - depending on cup size).

Be sure to find the right beans for your coffee. Ones that have been over roasted (evident as they are extremely oily) will tend to clog the burr grinder (fact) and be too bitter (IMO).

Buy once... Cry once! Why keep buying cheaper models that never produce top shelf espresso drinks then buying another in hopes of finding caffeinated euphoria?

This is pure heaven baby... ENJOY!

* Breville's small knock-box (avail on Amazon - BES001XL) is the perfect size and a must-have to knock the coffee pucks out efficiently from the portafilter."
89,4.0,2022-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought the Barista Express in December 2020 as there was a discount for $599. Reading the reviews, I also purchased the 4 year plan as the Barista Express comes with only a 1 year warranty.
This is a perfect machine to create the morning cappuccino and given the amount of milk, it is very much forgiving to the quality of the coffee beans. This espresso machine best makes dark roast beans, worse for medium roast and not suitable for light roast.
The most difficult coffee to make with any coffee maker is espresso, but that gives - me - the joy I was expecting from a coffee machine. If you don't want to drink an espresso, but something longer, don't read further, you can buy this machine, this is going to live up to any expectations.
For the Espresso, the machine is limited in its capabilities. I tried about 20-40 different types of coffees, grinding sizes, amounts, including every type of Illy coffees. The machine could not make great coffee, every type was sour and/or bitter until I found a local roaster that had 2-3 different dark roasts and one of them became my favorite, with the right amount, grinding size it creates nice espresso. As this is a higher priced coffee, I use it for Espresso and a cheap LIDL dark roast coffee for the morning cappuccino.
The machine is sensitive to aging, even the local coffee comes down faster after a week or two and becomes less creamy but still better than most coffees even in coffee shops. I was always afraid of steaming milk, but by now I can say it is very easy even with this machine, you can make a perfect steamed milk, just watch some Youtube videos.
It is easy to clean the machine, just follow the instructions every 2 months as it indicates. The machine warms up quite fast, if you are in a hurry, then wait just 5 minutes and always let water flow through at least once to warm it up. You absolutely MUST buy a 54mm dosing funnel and a small scale to measure the beans and the amount of coffee to keep a steady quality.
Overall I think for the money, this is a great machine if you are willing to dedicate a little time to find your favorite bean and coffee type."
90,5.0,2022-08-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If it was easy, everybody would make perfect crema. Sigh. You will want to jump in and make coffee immediately. Who wouldn't? I did. I read the manual and plunged in. It was only after many, many attempts that I started to do research. First, read VR's review on Amazon from January 27, 2018. It's a good starting point. Might still be the top review. . There are many YouTube videos about this specific machine. Confusing for the most part. The best tip I got was do NOT use that Razor trimmer. Saw this on a YouTube video and it finally made sense to me. What you want is an EVEN distribution of the coffee. Flat and firmly packed. Use that tamping device and really press firm and evenly. The Razor just plays havoc on the surface. And what you do not want is the water pressure sliding around in there. You want it to stay evenly distributed across the top of the coffee. I finally got the espresso pressure up after doing this. Anyway, it took me a few months but I'm doing better. Now to get the milk to froth.

ADDENDUM November 23, 2021: Update! Note the date. It has taken me this long to finally perfect the espresso. Do NOT panic! I gave up several times. Had I stuck with it, it wouldn't have taken me this long.
First: don't pay too much attention to the written instructions with the machine. Kinda worthless. Better to jump over to YouTube and watch some demos.
Second: do NOT overload the grinder. It's better to use enough for one or two grinds. And the fresher the coffee the better.
Third: pre-heat your water spigot by priming the pumps before the actual brew. Prime the water into the demitasse cup or little glass cups that you should have ordered since they do not come with the machine!
Fourth: set the grinder amount to more and the grind consistence to fine. Let the auto grind do its thing. It will overflow a bit.
Fifth: after you've got your grind, tamp it down several times to settle the grounds. Take the little barbell and press evenly and HARD into the grinds. Pro tip: the pressed grinds need to be perfectly flat and without any cracks or gaps. This way the water seeps through evenly.
Sixth: let 'er rip. The goal is to get the infusion to espresso levels on the little gauge. When you do, you'll be surprised at how good it turns out."
91,2.0,2022-08-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my first time writing a review for any product.

Over a period of 3-4 months the extraction time for my Barista dropped from 25-30 seconds to 12-14 seconds, thus causing a bitter taste. I used 2 bags of coffee as I adjusted the heat, grind amount, grind course/fine dial, cleaned and descaled as recommended but none of these adjustments changed the short extraction time which affects the taste and richness of the coffee.

On 10/14/21, I began communicating with Breville customer service. The first time I was on hold for a half hour and had to disconnect to answer an incoming phone call. The next time I was on hold and used their ""someone will call you back"" option. Approximately 1-2 hours later, a customer service rep called me back. As soon as I answered the phone, he hung up. As in any call center, I have to assume that these Breville customer service employees have quotas to meet for the number of calls they complete during a specified time period. You can surmise the reason for the quick hang up.

I attempted a fourth time and was placed on hold for over an hour before speaking to someone. The employee I spoke to utilized a video connection so I could real time demonstrate the problem with the quick extraction. I also explained the improper time of extraction greatly affected the taste of the coffee. After going through several cycles of coffee extractions via video showing the same problem, this employee stated she would send me a return/repair label and put me on hold. She returned after several minutes and said there was nothing wrong with the machine, but would send me a complimentary bag of coffee beans! I declined the offer and advised this solution was unsatisfactory.

I attempted a fifth time, was on hold for an hour and spoke to a third employee about the problem with the extraction time. She told me if the coffee beans were roasted more than 30 days prior to purchase, the extraction would not work properly. I asked her to review the previous notes from my prior call and provide the name of the employee who used real time video and saw the problem with the machine. She replied no one signed the prior notes and would not provide the name of the person. The purpose of asking for the names of employees I dealt with was to establish a record of calls for future use if the issue wasn't resolved.

I attempted a sixth time and was on hold for 45 minutes before I spoke to a customer service rep. I asked for the name of the first person I spoke to, which she quickly provided. The rep's name was who initially agreed the machine needed repair. was Jean Orozco. On 10/28/21, I asked to speak to a supervisor and transferred to supervisor Monica Fernandez. Monica asked how old the roasted date was on my Peet's dark roast coffee. I advised the beans were roasted within 60 days of purchase. She recommended I purchase coffee beans no older than 30 days from purchase date. It should be noted that neither the Barista manual nor the machine description reflects this is a requirement to obtain a correctly extracted espresso.

Nevertheless, I found a local roaster in Orlando and confirmed the beans were roasted within 7 days of purchase. After multiple attempts and multiple adjustments, the machine still does not properly extract and the coffee continues to have an unpleasant bitter taste.

It is now 11/5/21. I emailed Monica Fernandez twice asking her to call me so that I would not spend an hour on hold waiting to speak to someone. To date she has not followed up with a phone call or email response.

I attempted a seventh time to resolve the extraction defect, spoke to Javier, a customer service rep and asked to speak to Monica Fernandez. He put me on hold a few minutes and stated Monica was not available and would call me within the hour. She again failed to return my call. As a result, I am posting this review.

My experience with Breville reflects the company does not stand by its warranty for a product that costs $600-$700. After 3 weeks and 7 attempts to resolve the extraction issue, Breville will not repair a $600.00 espresso machine that worked properly for less than 4 months from date of purchase.

The Barista makes excellent espresso if it works properly. Unfortunately, Breville seems to be more focused on selling their products as opposed to honoring the warranty when the product needs repair or replacement within the warranty period. Their customer service/support department has a serious problem which starts from the top down. I would not recommend a Breville Barista for these reasons."
92,4.0,2022-08-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There are some longer, probably better reviews that I recommend you take the time to read. As a 600-700 purchase, you should be reading the top reviews on here several times over. They have a lot of good advice. I've had the machine about two months and some things I've noticed.

First, it's a really good machine for home use. It's not perfect, but it satisfies me to the point I don't need to go to a coffee house for an espresso or a latte anymore.

This machine goes on sale for $599 pretty often so don't pay an extra $100 for no reason. Just wait.

You will need some extras, this is not a stand alone purchase. It will require regular cleaning and you have to buy specialized products to do that maint. Don't skip this! Change the filters, do the descale and cleaning cycles when it tells you to.

I bought a stack of towels as was recommended in the top review. I recommend that highly. They are great to have around the kitchen.

The steam wand will take some practice, and I suspect it's one of the things about this machine where they cut some costs. I make pretty good steamed milk, but I think it would turn out better with a higher end machine. Just the nature of it.

Use fresh beans. The coffee you make will ultimately only be as good as what beans you use. Go find a local roaster or get a coffee subscription from a website that partners with roasters across the country. They will ship you freshly roasted beans. I started using this machine with Starbucks beans and was underwhelmed. When I switched to beans literally roasted in the past week, from Trade certified sources... Well the improvement was clear. If you're going to buy this machine, commit to spending the money on great coffee beans. Also, it should be noted that if you don't use the same beans all the time, you will have to dial in the settings with each new bean. I didn't think this would be the case, but it is. There are subtle difference and you'll need to adjust the grind size and quantity of the grind.

Speaking of grind, for a double shot I highly recommend you use the single cup setting for the grind, tamp after the first batch, then do a second grind to get the correct amount of coffee. This will greatly reduce how much coffee you spill when grinding.

All in all, it's a really nice machine for the price. I'm glad I didn't buy something cheaper. I will probably upgrade a few years down the road to something really serious, but it does make a really good cup of coffee as long as you are willing to pay attention to the details."
93,5.0,2022-08-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, so lovely to have an Americano every single morning with so little fuss. Warms up in about 30 seconds - takes 2 minutes for the whole process. Sometimes I need to adjust the tamping if it is too low or high on the pressure, but I think that is user error. I don’t get too fancy with the grind and beans, and it tastes great. Coffee and water temp is also perfect. Have used it multiple times a day for 2 months."
94,4.0,2020-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We’ve had this machine for about a week and it has made my mornings something to look forward to. First, unpacking the machine was like unpacking a new iPhone, and it really shows the quality and pride of Breville. The machine itself is stunning. Most importantly, it makes fantastic espressos and lattes. The best features are the integrated grinder and the foamer, both of which do their jobs exceptionally well. The grinder is definitely a luxury, but it consistently grinds the exact amount and grind size you need for every cup. The portafilter is distinctly heavy and of great quality. The tray is easy to remove and clean, and the hideaway storage and magnetic tamper is well thought out. Very pleased with the quality of Breville and now understand the value for the $600+ price tag.

Few improvements for Breville.
1. The water reservoir is in the back which is great from an aesthetic perspective. But unless you pay attention to the water level every time you use it, you can run the machine dry and damage it. Breville should put a flashing light in front to indicate low water level.
2. It is recommended that the machine warm up for 20 min+ prior to use for optimum temperatures. But It’s really not convenient to jump out of bed every morning to turn this on (before you brush your teeth and wash up) so you can brew your coffee without waiting. So, why not design this machine to stay warm all the time like some other appliances or electronics?

Final thoughts for novices. A machine like this can be somewhat intimidating at first, particularly if you read the extensive instructions and watch how-to videos, but you really don’t need to overcomplicate the process. Hey, it’s just coffee. Just make sure there is enough water in the reservoir, that the grinds are adequately fine (based on pressure gauge), and clean it every day. Get it, enjoy it, and don’t overthink it."
95,4.0,2022-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had the machine for more than 6 months now, I've resisted writing a review until now, because I wanted to make sure I figured out how to deal with some of the symptoms that most people are complaining about.
For those who complain about not being able to get the extraction needle to point in the right zone, there are some facts of life you need to understand. The 3 major components that go into an espresso extraction are: grind size, grind volume, and tamp pressure. There's actually a 4th component, and that is the coffee bean itself. (Some will say temperature is a factor, which is true, but nowadays most machines are set to around 200 degrees F). The reality and truth is that depending on the bean you're working with, if you're not getting the correct extraction, you will need to adjust any of the 3 components I mentioned. I learned this by having wasted lots of good and very expensive espresso beans. I've tried many different brands, from Lavazza to Illy to Klatch to Simon Hsieh's Coffee, each brand, each roast is different. What I've learned is that each time you try a new bean, you will need to experiment until you get it right. Some beans require you to grind it fine (3), some you may need to grind more coarse (6). There is NO absolute setting for any espresso. Anyone who tell you otherwise has not tried enough espresso beans. What would make you a good barista is after a while you will get a pretty good feel of how much you should grind, how coarse or fine you should grind, and how hard you should tamp.
And for those who are expecting this to be automatic, or somewhat automatic, return your machine and get something else. There is nothing automatic about this machine, if anything, it's the extraction time that's sort of automatic. You can control everything, from the grind size to the volume, to the extraction time and temperature. What makes this machine great are 2 things: the built-in burr grinder, and the extraction pressure gauge. The built-in grinder helps make fresh espresso, and the gauge tells you if you're extracting at an optimal level.
So, here's what I usually do when I make my espresso. I usually start with grind size at 5. I don't use the preset grind volume, I manually grind. As I'm grinding I'm tapping the side of the portafilter so the coffee will spread out more evenly. About 3/4 full I stop the grinding, tap the portafilter on my counter so the coffee will settle in more, then I grind a little bit more until the coffee forms a small mound above the top edge of the portafilter. I tap again to settle the coffee down, then I tamp. There's no good way to tell anyone how hard or soft I'm tamping, I only know by now I know how much pressure to use. My advice is to always tamp softer if you're not sure. If you over tamp you'll know right away as the needle will just jump up to about 9 or 10 o'clock, even in pre-infusion. When I extract, based on where the needle is I will make adjustments. I've found changing the volume to be the easiest adjustment, because if it's over extracting, that means there's too much pressure, and pressure usually comes from volume and tamp pressure. This is why I manually grind, and in the case of over extracting I just grind less coffee the next time. If it's under extracted, then add some more coffee. If it's still under, then tamp harder. I usually don't change the grind size until the first two changes haven't made a difference. Lastly, I have the temperature set to 202 degrees Fahrenheit, as most roasters specify to extract at 94 degree Celsius. Since the default temp on the Breville is 200 and go up and down in increments of 2 degrees, I chose to go up.
The 4 star rating is because of the frother. It's horrible. It's already bad enough that this is not a dual boiler, so I have to wait to do one or the other. But the frothing is really weak and takes a while to get good frothing done. I wish they would've made a better tip for the frothing wand, or at least give me the option to replace the tip with a better one. So far I've yet to find one.
Otherwise, it's the best machine out there for the price. Once you've mastered it, you will be enjoying great espresso every time!"
96,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm writing this review as we – myself and my wife, who is a barista and works for a local boutique coffee roaster – close in on the 5 year mark of owning the Barista Express. All told, this machine has been a reliable workhorse and has provided us with thousands of shots over the years. I have recommended this purchase to several friends and will continue to do so.

That said, there are some things to keep in mind. First, maybe this should go without saying, but the quality of espresso isn't ever going to match what you get from a $10,000 machine at a serious coffee shop. Still, the Barista Express provides real espresso with the correct texture, temperature, and crema. While the milk steamer isn't as powerful as the ones on a commercial machine, it creates totally competent micro foam –  it just takes a little longer and requires a careful hand to make sure you don't boil the milk.

Our biggest issue with the machine has been maintenance. About 2 years in it stopped working – it would make a lot of noise but nothing would come out even after we cleaned and descaled it several times. It turned out to be some kind of issue with the pressure mechanism. Breville customer service was great and fixed it for free, but shipping it out was a pain and we were without the machine for almost a month. Separate from that, the machine really does need a lot of love and care. If you don't clean and descale often, it will stop working correctly. If you go too long without cleaning and descaling, you will need to get it professionally serviced. (We had to do that once, too)

In comparison to some other products on the market, I think the Barista Express is also the way to go. At one point I purchased a Gaggia Classic and had a very difficult time pulling consistent shots. While I haven't owned one, I had the opportunity to use one of Breville's very expensive machines (I think my friend spent around $2,000 on it) with a digital interface and I didn't notice any difference in quality. I also don't love the fully automatic machines and prefer to have more control over the process – especially given how knowledgable my wife is, we dial our machine in every time we get a new bag of coffee.

All told, we have been incredibly happy with this purchase. If you are like my wife and I and tend to spend a lot of money at coffee shops on espresso drinks, you will make your money back on the purchase in less than a year and you truly can't afford to NOT buy it. Despite some issues with maintenance, it is still chugging along 5 years down the road and it has paid for itself many times over."
97,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took some tweaking to get it working well enough, and although I expected something a bit more impressive, it works ok.

- I expect we will break even in 6 months with as many lattes as we were getting out.
- I wonder if the one I received builds up the expected amount of pressure.
- The steamer/foam part is impressive.
- It uses more water than I’d expect (we only use filtered water from our Berkee.)
- the foam texture is excellent once you get the hang of it.

It’s a bit expensive for what I feel we purchased, but it’s an all in one grinder and maker, which is handy. If you’re on a budget, a $150~ unit and a stand alone grinder would be fine. Buying cappuccino-ground coffee may be too fine for your machine, so I recommend you get your own adjustable grinder.

Pro tip my wife figured out: Put little sticky topped felt furniture pads under the Breville’s rubber feet so you can easily slide it into position to make your cappuccino or to add water."
98,5.0,2022-08-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have been using this machine for several months now and we love it. It took some adjusting to get the perfect expresso but well worth it. two thumbs up!
99,5.0,2016-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,The flavor and quality is great!
100,5.0,2022-09-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My last Breville lasted 12-years. So I searched for someone local to fix it and that seemed to be the problem; no one fixes consumer goods, “they just want you to buy another!” The best advise from the fix-it guy was that my machine lasted more than 10-years. So instead of buying one of those fancy Italian delights I just thought I’d save a few thousand dollars and see if I can go another 10-years with this one. Okay, time for an espresso."
101,5.0,2019-10-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am very happy with this machine. I am not a heavy coffee drinker, about 1- 2 coffee/Latte a day. This machine is perfect for me and it is easy to use and easy to clean. The coffee/latte tastes excellent. The only thing that took me sometime to find out is to control the pressure. Not only how fine the ground you select, but I also found that you need to make the grounded coffee evenly distributed in the filler before brew. You may also need to press down with a little pressure on the grounded coffee using the tamper. Of course, you need to use the correct filler in filter for one or two shots. Other than that, the machine is easy to use."
102,5.0,2022-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I own two coffee shops (that use 20k La Marzocco espresso machines), and this is my home machine. We have 5 teenagers, and have made 6-10 coffees per day on this machine over the past 1.5 years we have owned it. Simply put, Breville makes the best no-fuss (but adjustable enough) home espresso machines on the market. Easy to use, easy to clean, and it’s just pushed through everything like a champ.

Pros:
- Simple to use
- Reliable
- Built in grinder that does a great job for the price point
- Fairly compact for the functionality

Cons:
- Depending on your beans and how fine you have to grind them for a proper shot (we have our own custom roast), there’s no way to grind a double without losing 30% of your ground coffee over the size. It just spills all over. Originally, I would just do two single grinds, lightly tamping the first down before grinding the second on top. Really hard to get tamp it the right amount across two tamps like that. Ultimately, we got the this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08WLN3JXY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, which I think is essential if you intend to do double shots (which is pretty much all we do).
- Steam wand isn’t the greatest, but not terrible. It’s a bit slow (due to boiler capacity), and it doesn’t thread in enough air automatically. You need to finesse it a bit by raising wand to towards surface of the milk/cream while frothing to mix in enough air. But definitely not terrible for a single boiler consumer machine."
103,5.0,2018-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Spending $5-8 or more every morning on over-the-top coffee?? That adds up fast.
Is this the BEST machine on the market, no. Does it need to be, no. Can you do everything a barista does with this machine? In short, yeah, they learned how, and so can you. No need for a $10k machine or a job behind the counter to do it.... we can all YouTube this together! lol! Google Diploma in progress.

Crunching the math, in my case, if this machine lasts me about a year (which I hope it exceeds that), I can have delicious espresso every day, 365, for less money than the cost of a morning ""something"" at the coffee shop 5 days a week on my way to work. I get to learn things, I may fail some of the time, I may run out of time some of those mornings and go back to the coffee shop for a few drinks here and there, but in the long run I feel like I've made an effort to put my money to better use and still get to have my morning espresso jolt. Cheers to creating a better life filled with coffee!"
104,4.0,2022-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I previously owned a more simplified Breville machine that made great espresso and lasted me for nearly 10 years. I bought this machine in December of 2019 and I am writing this review in late April 2020. No issues whatsoever thus far. It is a good machine. I work in luxury hotels, I spent most of my career as Director of F&B. This machine makes better espresso than most of the machines (though not all machines) that I have used in restaurants. The biggest secret to great expresso is grinding the beans just before pulling a shot, which this machines does. It comes with pressurized and non-pressurized filters. I don't have an issue using the non-pressurized filters, but it takes a bit more knowhow to use them. The non-pressure filter makes a higher quality espresso. So in terms of the quality of the espresso-- very good! The pressure gauge is also very nice to have when using non-pressurized baskets. For those technically inclined, it allows you to adjust the grind and degree of compaction to pull the perfect shot. In my view, reliability is also essential when purchasing a machine. Having run F&B programs, I can tell you that machines breakdown quite often. In coffee shops and restaurants, they are serviced regularly to keep them running. For that reason, I purchased an extended warranty. I did not want a super automatic machine because in my view, the more complex the machine, the more the issues. More expensive is not always better, that strategy can backfire on you. This model has all of the necessary technical specs to pull a shot that is high quality, without needless bells and whistles. It steams well and the hot water dispenser is very convenient. It heats up quickly and has great ergonomic features. Ease of use was not a factor for me, but it is not difficult to use, I could see people who are not knowledgeable or technically inclined getting frustrated with this model, but to me-- it's pretty straightforward. Now for the negative highlights: It is messy-- you can't use the grinder and tamp the shot without making a mess. I find myself tamping the shots over the trash can or over the sink..... That's the only issue, but it is certainly something to consider. I usually try to put 3 small doses into the portafilter, tamping it lightly each time to cut down on the messy overflow. The grinds don't just fall in the tray, they get on the counter. I have a towel under mine to catch grinds and to allow me to pull the maneuver the machine on the countertop. That is really the only negative. I love this machine and I use it EVERY day-- I am very particular when it comes to coffee ;)"
105,5.0,2022-08-07, Black Sesame,Great product and shipping
106,5.0,2014-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine does a great job of grinding the beans and extracting awesome espresso shots. The biggest challenge is dialing in the grind amount and fineness. The steam wand takes a little while to crank up and does a good job of generating micro foam.
107,5.0,2021-11-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This Breville is a great choice for anyone looking for good to great espresso brewing and not wanting to spend $1500+

We have owned several espresso machines over the years - one manual grind, fill and brew and two superautomatics. While this doesn't match the ease of the superautos it definitely produces better shots. Surprisingly the supers lasted many years each, I hope this will do the same. When it came time to replace them I was intrigued by the simplicity of this one along with the control over grind and brewing that it offers. Overall for the money it's an excellent machine.

A few tips:
1) It's fairly easy to get dialed in so be patient and don't be worried that you won't be able to consistently get good performance. It just takes a little understanding of how to adjust grind, amount and tamp properly. It can vary slightly by type of bean but overall it's a simple task. The manual is easy to follow.

2) Same goes for programming. Adjust temp or brew volume. Very simple.

3) Mine performed a bit better after a little break in of say 5 to 10 shots. After that it's been consistent. And easy to pull shots in the ideal range of brewing pressure.

4) The middle zone of grind amount is a bit shy of ideal. For mine mid way between the middle and the extreme is working best. About 4-5 o'clock setting on the grind amount dial. With medium tamping pressure.

5) I was concerned that it might seem a lot more messy after using superautomatics for many years. This works really well though to fill the portafilter accurately without getting grounds every where. Surprisingly well. That was an issue with the old manual we had which did not have the integrated grinder. Having the built in grinder that auto fills the filter is a big plus. And the grinder works great.

6) multi filter baskets makes it pretty versatile and easy to use preground coffee to change it up. This is a great option if you want an occasional decaf for some reason.

Cons:
Not many.
Is it going to produce the same pressure and shot as a $3500 machine? Of course not but it's not the same as that type of machine in many ways. Still the quality of product is very good and close to the same level of brew.

Water tank - it's a bit small for some, but enough when full to easily produce 4 doubles. The biggest issue with the tank is really about placement. It's on the back which looks good but depending on how you situate the machine on the counter or in a corner it can be a little annoying to get to. The machine is sturdy on its feet and does not sit on a swivel like some. So access to the tank is a little cumbersome.

If you are looking for a bargain machine that produces great espresso this is definitely one to try. Hopefully pump longevity is great. If so, it really is a great buy."
108,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"[3/5/20 update after more than 2 years: yes, I felt the need to write this and I only have good things to say about machine. I notice it's still pretty expensive on Amazon (over $ 550), but I would say it's well worth it if you like good coffee and want to be able to make a real espresso. I only drink 2 morning cups of coffee per day (usually strong cafe americanos with 2% warm milk) and I am still happy to have it. Some advice from experience:
* DO NOT get oily/dark roast beans. they will clog up the grinder. I use medium roast beans, usually roasted within a month or so. i try to support local roasters too.
* machine can be messy, sometimes the grinded coffee spills over the portafilter basket, but that's not a big deal. I set my dosage dial to position just past normal.
* it sometimes helps to run an empty single shot through the portafilter to warm things up and between shots to clean off old grinds from top of filter.
* frother works perfectly but can be messy, no getting around that. i use a nespresso frother to warm (or froth) up my milk.]

I've had this machine for a year and it's been great -- I would give 5 stars (which is perfect and near impossible) but has couple minor issues (mentioned below).

My experience has been with mid/high level grinder (Macap) and machine (Gaggia Classic). That combo was getting tiresome trying to ""dial in"" the right grind/amount etc. I also have a Nespresso machine which produces great espressos but is $$ and not that eco-friendly.

The Breville Barista is a great compromise. It is economical, versatile, simple to use, and takes less space/hassle of having a separate grinder/machine.
* Choose your beans, getting the right grind fineness does not take too long. With each new bag of beans, it takes maybe a few shots to get the espresso pull. I've used VERY fresh beans (roasted day before) and somewhat fresh (roasted 1 month ago) and have gotten excellent results from both. I think it's more important to just find the beans you like and stick with them.

* If you like a cafe americano (a ""normal"" size cup of coffee), it is VERY easy. Simply make double espresso and add hot water from machine dispenser. This is my ""go to"" morning coffee, with some heated 2% milk (this I do in nespresso aeroccino since machine frother is too messy).

* If you're lazy and don't want to fool around with grind adjustment OR you are using pre-ground coffee (I do this for decaf friends), you can use pressurized portafilter baskets (come with machine). You will get a decent looking espresso with this.

* Minor issues (very minor!) with machine: (1) when you empty excess water (in tray at bottom of machine), it may spill into storage basket. I try to do this before tray fills up about once/week and before indicator shows full. (2) you sometimes need to help beans in hopper make their way into the grinder, otherwise you will not have enough ground coffee in the basket (3) machine cleaning cycle is pretty frequent, but it's easy and cheap to do (if you order filters/tablets in bulk off amazon).

* I have seen others have had issues and repairs are $$$. I will update if I have any issues."
109,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,LOVE IT! BEST BRAND AND BEST MACHINE! I looked and looked and this was the best! And I have another one from this brand that didn’t have the grinder - get the grinder!
110,5.0,2021-08-19, Black Sesame,"I just purchased my fourth Barista Express machine: Four years ago, one for my home, then two as gifts, and now one for my second home when my expensive but plastic-y current machine there went belly up. They make very decent espresso and all four machines are still going strong. It's a pleasure to work with such a fine , all-metal instrument when making my morning mocha. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but my pappy gave me wise words of advice when I was growing up: ""Buy the best and you'll never be sorry!"""
111,5.0,2021-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had this Breville Espresso machine for a little over a month and have really grown to love it. Although it took a while to tweak the settings to our liking, we've been able to settle in and repeatedly make delicious lattes, such that it is easy to give this machine 5 stars.

I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to making espresso, but I have experience with a somewhat older professional La Marzocco machine at a previous company and more recently a ""prosumer"" Rocket espresso machine at my current employer.

Although it's taken a bit of tweaking, I've gotten to where I consistently enjoy a latte made on my Breville Espresso machine more than I enjoy one made on the Rocket machine at work. I expect this comes mostly from doing a better job keeping my equipment clean at home than we do at work, and from the ability to measure out a consistent dose on the Breville machine, which we don't have with our grinder at work.

The main thing lacking in the Breville machine vs the other higher end machines I've used is that the Breville machine isn't quite as powerful. To be sure, it gets the job done and does a great job steaming milk, but it's not able to steam milk nearly as quickly as the Rocket machine we have at work (rough estimate might be 45 seconds vs 15 seconds). Considering the cost difference between the Breville and the prosumer competitors (and don't forget that the burr grinder is included on the Breville—an expensive addition if purchased separately!), if you're okay with waiting a little longer to steam your milk, the Breville is an easy choice.

A few tips to be successful with the Breville Espresso machine:
- Find a local roaster, if possible. Good quality beans make a big difference. We buy Espresso Savio by 1000 Faces from a local coffee shop.
- Play around with the grind size and the grind amount to find the right balance of pressure, volume, and crema in your espresso shots. It took probably a half dozen attempts to get this right.
- I don't use the dosing tool. Your mileage may vary but I find I don't need it.
- Don't tamp too hard! It's easy to want to put your weight into tamping, but over tamping can make it hard for the machine to extract espresso.
- I thought the espressos wasn't as hot as I'd like, so adjusted the temp up 4º. I've also been consistently running the portafilter and my mug under hot water.
- Only put in approximately enough beans to make the espresso you're going to drink right now.
- Clean the grinder once a week with a brush to remove debris and oils.
- For lattes, don't use too much foam.

A few design features which stand out to me:
- Just about every piece is replaceable
- The removable tray is really well thought out. It will ""pull"" out an accessory tray in the back which is easily detached.
- The removable tray is very easy to empty and clean
- Portafilter baskets are relatively easy to swap out
- The hot water automatically shuts off after making a cup of hot water. Nice touch!
- The included burr grinder with the ability to adjust grind size and dose amount is really convenient"
112,5.0,2021-04-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine. Very simple to use.
113,4.0,2022-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this coffee maker as an excuse to spend the money we would save not going anywhere during kids spring break. When it first arrived, we had a little difficulty dialing in the pressure needed to extract the coffee perfectly. After watching videos and learning of a setting in the grinder as well, my wife, has dialed it in to make a perfect coffee. I still have some trouble but I believe it to be the amount of pressure when packing the coffee puck. Then again maybe woman are better at everything. Anyways, I use as a good excuse for her to fix me a cup of coffee so it’s a win for me. I would buy again is my recommendation."
114,5.0,2021-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had a Breville for 5 years before this model, that I loved. I really had no good reason to buy this because my other one was still functioning perfectly. But I went ahead anyway for two reasons: I saw a video that made the workflow look much nicer, and just the look of the bean that came out of the grinder was intoxicating.

To say I'm not disappointed is an understatement. This may be my favorite appliance of all time.

This machine already has so many 5 star reviews, I decided to write another for two reasons:

1. This machine is such a huge improvement over the prior model it's astounding that it came out as being the same price.
2. The types of improvements indicate that Breville is that rare company that really does learn and refine, delivering amazing excellence.

On the first point, my prior machine had a few little warts: when it started to make the espresso, it would vibrate and often it would move the cup out of the way and pour the espresso down into the grill. I tried a lot of things to cure that. The only real solution was using really big mugs but even then it was rickety. This thing is smooth as silk. Granted, it is significantly bigger, but they have made big improvements. It feels like a completely different machine. Like going from a pinto to a cabin cruiser.

Having the grinder onboard is fantastic. I was using a Krups that sat next to the machine. I was grinding every day or two and keeping the bean in a small mason jar, but still, fresh ground is going to win every time. Also, the grind looks totally different than what you get from a steel blade grinder, which tends to go from coarse to powder very quickly with not much in between. This was one of the main reasons I upgraded: I was off coffee for 15 years and went back after countless studies showed its ability to prevent neurodegenerative disease. Clearly, beans that were ground just now, and in a more gentle, less oxidizing way (the metal blade grinder whip up the contents too much), are going to be the best you can do on this front.

One of the other huge areas of improvement is the degree to which the machine teaches you how to make the coffee you want to make. This alone is worth the purchase price. Turns out I was using 2x the coffee I needed to on the old machine, with pressure rarely getting over minimum. This setup has already in a few days taught me more about getting that balance right, and there are more controls and easier ways to see the effects of each change you make. This is really huge: the ultimate in design is when the product also trains the user.

I am a software developer. We talk a lot about Lean as a process methodology: Kaizen, constant improvement, by minding the things that are done to produce a result. The workflow of making coffee on this new machine is so much nicer: no more transferring ground beans, etc. Filling the water is still kind of a drag. I think they should have a simple way to attach this thing to a water supply, but, that's a minor nit.

Finally, on the financial side, though many people consider $600 a crazy amount to pay for a coffee machine, when you get coffee out it's ~$3 per serving. That means 200 servings later, this thing has paid for itself. Also, an interesting study recently showed that very large machines in commercial installations are often cleaned with harsh chemicals that leach lead into the water. This is the best way there is today to make coffee."
115,5.0,2015-03-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update: I've now had this machine for a year, and we still adore it. Not long ago we had to evacuate for a hurricane, and I actually packed this up and took it with me, because I couldn't bear the thought of a long evacuation without good coffee in the morning. I still wish the water tank were bigger.
----------------------------------------------------------------
I got this machine for Christmas and we love it so much. I have three teenage sons, so this machine gets a lot of traffic, especially on the weekends. My husband hates learning new gadgets, so I was a bit worried about him, but with a few practice runs, he’s now also enjoying daily Americanos and says it’s the best “coffee” he’s ever had. On weekday mornings we stick to Americanos, and the hot water dispenser makes a good tea too. For mornings where we can slow down more, all of us have gotten decent at steaming and frothing milk, although that definitely took some trial and error.

I appreciate the small footprint of this espresso maker. Some users have suggested ample space is needed around the machine, but we have it on a smaller counter segment with only 6-8” on either side and it’s fine. When we had it set up at my parents’ house, it was horizontally awfully close to the bottom their cabinet, but it fit. However, that makes it harder to remove and replace the water receptacle, which for my family needs to be done at a minimum daily, and usually more. I have higher raised cabinets though, so it’s fine.

As far as accessories, we bought some double-walled glasses, but we mostly drink taller drinks that need a mug. I recently bought an inexpensive knock box, and this is more useful than I would have expected. Besides using it for disposing of grounds (or in our case transferring them to compost), it’s also handy to have below as you smooth and level grounds. Before I’d walk over to the sink to do that, inevitably leaving a trail of grounds. I also bought a poster that shows all the different kinds of coffee drinks. That’s a fun reference and provides more drink ideas.

The cleaning light finally came on a few days ago, but as I said we’re heavy users. I used one of the tablets that came with the machine and followed the directions. It was a pretty easy process. I haven’t needed to descale it yet. Once or twice a bean has jammed the grinder, but again that was an easy fix even for the mechanically uninclined.

Overall, we love this machine. I hope it has a nice long and happy life."
116,4.0,2020-04-27, Black Sesame,"Highly satisfied with this machine! I was a barista for 20 years and I recently left the business. I wanted a high quality machine that would allow me to recreate the same quality beverages at home. This one checks off all the boxes.

This machine isn’t for the new barista. That’s just my opinion, but you will find yourself frustrated and feeling like you wasted your money if you don’t at least know the basics of quality espresso before you get this machine on your counter.

The only thing I’ll say operationally about this machine, is that the steam wand lacks power. Once you accept that and learn how to steam with lower pressure, you will be rocking! The espresso that this machine produces is wonderful! That being said, you’re only going to be limited by the quality of the beans you use! You will also probably waste a decent amount of beans getting the grinder “dialed in” and learning the general nuances of the machine. Each time you change to different beans, you will likely need to readjust the grind as well. Again, bean quality is super important! I got some lower quality beans and the machine wouldn’t even pressurize with it being very finely ground. Don’t spend $700 on this machine if you don’t want to spend the extra couple bucks to get good beans!"
117,5.0,2022-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Alright, I never write reviews, but this product deserved an exception. First of all, I can't even make a decent pot of coffee and have to rely on K-Cups, so I was really intimidated by this thing. BUT IT'S SO EASY TO USE! The instructions are really well written and clear, and I had it set up and making espressos in no time.

PROS: GREAT TASTING DRINKS!
I use starbucks espresso beans and make mostly iced caramel macchiatos which taste EXACTLY like starbucks (not joking!). I've also made vanilla lattes, which are better than any other vanilla latte I had anywhere else. My husband is more of a traditional coffee drinker, so I just add water to the espresso (to make an Americano) and he can add his basic creamer.

PROS: EASY TO CLEAN
After each drink, just run a shot of water through the machine, and shoot some steam if you use the milk steamer. Once a month or so, vacuum out the bean topper/grinder and run the self cleaning cycle.

CON: The grinder has gotten stuck a couple times, but it's really easy to just open the hopper and vacuum out the stuck beans.

If you are debating getting this machine, don't debate. Just get it. You work hard and deserve it!"
118,4.0,2022-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine performs as expected every time. Here are a few tips I've learned over the years:
0: Read the instructions and become familiar with the machine; watch videos from others.
1. Not all coffee is equal. I've tried various coffee beans with most that can be ground to achieve the correct pressure. Others for some reason or another will never bring up pressure no matter how fine the grind or how hard the pack. A good grind will only require very little force to pack the basket. For ease of use, stick with coffee beans you like and note the grind setting and stick with them.
2. Once the grind setting is mastered, program the machine to produce the correct dose. The manual provides the information along with a vast number of videos on the Internet.
3. Hard water? DO NOT overlook this point. We used the machine without issue for 5 years, cleaning regularly. Last year we moved into a house with harder water. This led to the internal valves sticking. If you are not getting any water thru the machine, don't throw it away. Again, many videos on the Internet provide great instructions to show you how to fix. In my case, I removed the valves and soaked in citric acid and after putting the machine together, we are enjoying coffee again.
4. While I do not froth milk for my coffee, there are those in my household that do. Bottom line: Clean the wand after every use and run some steam thru it. If you find that steam will not come out of the tube, DO NOT remove the basket to search for an answer...that is unless you want to clean up a mess from the pressure build up. Breville provides a tool to clean the wand if it becomes plugged.
5. If you pack the the grind to hard creating to much overpressure and little coffee output, don't throw the batch out. Usually you can wait 10-15 seconds and try again. With the coffee now wet in the basket, you may find the machine will produce coffee at the desired pressure.

This has and is still a great machine for making espresso and coffee for almost 6 years. It gets operated 2-4 times a day and has paid itself off many times over compared to purchasing coffee off of the economy. I recommend the Barista Express Espresso Machine for anyone who is looking for an appliance with high consumer operating demand and longevity."
119,5.0,2022-08-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There’s a reason everyone I know owns this machine and buys another one for a second home, gifts, etc.
Simply the best combination of features and quality of extraction for the price!"
120,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"If you love a great cup of espresso the way you like it, this is a great machine. Once you get the grind right and the tamp with the correct amount of pressure, you are in for a treat. The pressure dial really helps in letting you know how well of a job you are doing and once you figure it out and you lock in the zone for 15-20 seconds of brewing, there is nothing left to do but enjoy! A few trial and error runs aside, this machine is worth it's weight, consistently providing killer results. Temperature settings are adjustable too, so for me an added bonus because I like my hot beverages very hot. The Panarello frothing wand works well too, although that isn't why I bought this unit. If you have it, spend the $$, you won't be disappointed...I promise."
121,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update: After 2 Years, I am still very satisfied. Nothing has broken, and the coffee is still great. Don't hesitate to buy this. I am at home 7 days a week now due to Covid-19 and I use the hell out of this. Original review below:

This is a great machine. Below are the reasons I give it a favorable rating.

Coffee - This is not my first espresso maker, but it's my first advanced model. It makes a great shot of espresso with good crema.

Second: Features - Not too many features. This unit has the basic ones you need: Automated Burr Grinder, Pressure Gauge, Single/Double shot options and of course a steam nozzle. There are a few tweaks you'll need to dial in, like any espresso maker. These center on grind size (easy to use dial on side of machine), grind quantity, and how to properly tamp down the espresso. Once you get that down, you're golden. Most importantly, the pressure gauge will tell you when you have your settings right. I only briefly referenced the manual to answer a few questions. Still haven't read the whole thing.

Second: Materials - It is made of good stainless steel and has user-serviceable parts. Espresso Portafilter is heavy gauge - it feels good in the hand too. Someone put some thought into the user-experience with this machine. Four filters are provided with the machine for varying brew quantity and strength.

Third: Longevity - I have been using this continuously for 4 months. No problems so far other than a clogged steam jet, which was easy to remedy via the screw-off steam nozzle. Didn't even have to reference the user manual - it was that easy. I will try to update later to see how it's doing after a year in service.

Fourth: Looks - this unit will most likely be placed in your kitchen, and it is not small. Your eye will be drawn to it (my friends all comment on it when they come over) so it's important that it not be a plastic beast. The stainless is easy to clean and looks good. It also has a great drip tray that tells you when it's full. I'm not a terribly neat guy, and this thing is easy to keep clean.

Why I Bought It:
My goal was to cut down on what I was spending at Starbucks. I was averaging one 5.00 coffee per day during the week. That means roughly $100.00 per month. I wanted an espresso maker that would provide quality coffee and, over the course of a year, save me money. The Breville BES870XL hits this mark. It also saves me a little time and some gas (going to the coffee shop). I still support my local coffee shop because the owner and his staff are great - but the afternoon trip to Starbucks is gone!

Hope this helps in your purchasing decision!"
122,5.0,2022-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have barely brewed a ‘regular’ pot of coffee since we got this, except for when we’re hosting large groups of family and friends.
Love it to death!"
123,5.0,2022-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Replaced our Nespresso machine. Much better ""cafe"" taste and feel. Hits the spot!!"
124,5.0,2022-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had the Breville BES870XL for about a week now, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the product and the quality of the espresso it can make. I upgraded from a simpler machine and a separate burr grinder, and one of the attractive features of the BES870XL was the integrated grinder. The other thing that appealed to me was the ability to adjust lots of features.

In the first few days, I experimented a lot with grind fineness (it can grind VERY fine - I'm quite pleased with the grinding function), the amount of grounds, and how hard I tamped the grounds. These three things, along with the amount of water (pre-programmed or manually controlled) can affect the extraction of the espresso. Since I like to obsess over coffee, I was quite happy to spend a few days figuring out just the right balance of these various things. My partner, however, was quite agitated that she couldn't simply make a decent espresso like we had been able to do with our previous machine. If you're impatient and don't like to experiment, this might not be the machine for you. However, after a few days I have now made some of the most delicious espresso I've ever drunk, and certainly the most delicious espresso I've ever made at home.

Initially, we had problems with the pressure. The gauge never went past ""pre-infusion"" stage, into the ideal espresso extraction range. The espresso came out too runny and had little to no crema. Even at the finest setting, filling the portafilter as much as possible and tamping as hard I could, I couldn't get that gauge to get above the pre-infusion stage. If this happens (or has happened) to you, don't give up, just read on here. I called Breville and got great customer service. I was told to test the pressure so that we'd know if the machine was defective or if I could adjust things to get the outcome I wanted. They had me use the single-walled, single-cup filter basket, insert the cleaning disk (a rubber disk that comes with the unit), and then fill the portafilter with foil. This would essentially block the basket and allow the pressure to rise. Then I hit the single espresso shot. After 3 or 4 times of this, the pressure went into the gray (espresso extraction) range, so we knew the machine was okay. But my next few shots of espresso still came out liquidy with hardly any crema.

Here's what I now do to get a delicious cup of caramel colored, sweet, thick espresso with a beautiful crema: I set the grinder to grind espresso that's the consistency of table salt (as Breville recommends), then I manually grind a bit of espresso into the portafilter, tap it on the counter a few times to settle the grounds (do NOT tamp in between - this will create air pockets), grind some more, tap some more, and so on, until the fourth time I finally have enough grounds in the portafilter that I can then tamp. In my experience, this technique compacts the grounds enough to remove the air space, and now the pressure gauge enters the proper region and I'm quite often able to make a fantastic espresso.

If you're not a perfectionist, you can still make a decent espresso with this machine, but I probably wouldn't bother spending the money. You can get a machine for $150 and a burr grinder for $100 and still make a good cup. But if you want an excellent cup and you don't want to spend over $1000, then this machine (and a little experimentation) will do the trick.

The Breville BES870XL is well engineered, well made, has lots of things you can adjust (grind fineness, grind amount, water amount, water temperature, pre-set or manual shot length), and looks nice besides. I'm quite happy with my purchase. And even though my partner was initially impatient and started questioning whether this was a good purchase, she's now a convert and is quite happy to have delicious espresso at home."
125,5.0,2022-03-19, Black Sesame,"The machine is great. Tune your settings for a specific coffee/grind and you’ll pull perfect shots every time. The only annoyance is when switching to new coffee brand, you gotta tweak the settings. They need to add a memory setting for your own presets."
126,5.0,2020-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Recommend it? yes, absolutely, but there's some caveats
- It's a single boiler so have to allow a little more time when frothing, but it still froths fantastic.
- Bigger issue is it's a 53.5 mm basket. Breville says it's a 54, it's not. The portafilter is 54 but the basket is 53.5 which creates issues when finding accessories. Industry standard is 58, 53 is also acceptable but 53.5/54 is sort of a one off. Using a 53mm press / distributor on a 53.5mm basket makes it difficult to get the density perfect. A 58 has more pressure because of the surface area @ 9bar, but is more prone to channeling because of the depth of the puck. 53/54 is deeper so less prone (slightly) but slightly less pressure on the puck.
- No way to adjust pre-infusion time that I'm aware of. This can create issues when you're really trying to dial in a specific bean.

That said I would absolutely buy the unit again, the next up that fixes these problems is $1000 more (Breville Dual Boiler) and they're very minor complaints. The BDB can be upgraded with a slayer mod where as the BBE can not... it's certainly a better machine which I'm hoping to get my hands on someday.

things to have:
- bean containers: airscape
- vacuum sealer for the rest of the beans that won't be used within the week
- a good scale: Acaia Lunar is my rec here, able to start timing w/ flow and auto tare
- 54mm Dosing ring so you don't spill when using the WDT technique to break up chunks
- WDT Tool: nice ones can be found on etsy
- 54mm Bottomless portafilter so you can see what's happening with the shot. Channeling etc.
- 53mm Coffee Distributor
- 53mm Calibrated tamper
- Knock box
- lots of Amazon basic dish towels, you'll be glad you did

You don't neeeeeed a lot of these things. But you also sort of do.

Grinder wise the built in is absolutely sufficient to get the job done, I wouldn't worry about getting an Encore/Virtuoso/Oxo unless you just want to. If you want to go with something in the $700 price range like the niche that will absolutely be an upgrade and I can't recommend that enough. Give those folks some business.

Good luck! Have fun!"
127,5.0,2022-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have the Gaggia classic as well. I saw the reviews were incredible for this product and the fact that it had a coffee grinder with controls...I was sold! My over-all review is a total 5 stars. This machine is impressive! I only have one draw back but it is probably me not the machine.

Negatives:
Only one minor one. The steamer wand takes time to warm up and I still struggle to get the whole milk froth like I did with my Gaggia, but it could be me. The Gaggia, after warm up and releasing some steam was strong steam. The Breville seems to sputter a lot of water and I can't get the same level of froth as my Gaggia. I find this odd because I saw side by side reviews with timers of these two machines and the Breville was better. I'll learn more about my new machine. I'm probably doing something wrong.
Update: I figured out the frother. If just takes a bit longer than the Gaggia but it works great!

The Positive:
Absolutely everything else! It's the small things that really shine! The sensors and design. They really thought this out! It reminds me of Kitchen Aid appliances. Easy to clean, and everything was well thought out for design. I won't repeat info in the specs. The Breville Espresso Machine has some helpful smart features to keep the machine clean and running smoothly. I am very pleased I bought this!

Comparing my Gaggia Classic with my Breville Espresso Machine:
I love them both. The Breville has far more control to pull that perfect shot of espresso. The Gaggia Classic is honestly limited to either finding the perfect bean and grind with a ton of trial and error or just using the filter with the single pin hole to force the pressure for a decent shot of espresso (illy dark roast pre-ground worked great for that). The Breville has all the smart features to quickly fine tune the perfect shot of espresso with fresh beans for espresso machines and you can nail it in just 2-3 attempts using the barrista filter with the full bottom filled with pin holes. Umbria Gusto Crema whole beans are even more magical with my Breville! Very impressive! Once you have it dialed in, you don't have to change it until you change beans. of course you can always use the filter with the single pin hole as well but that takes away all the impressive features the Breville has for that absolutely perfect shot of espresso."
128,5.0,2022-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Long time ago I had an el cheapo Krups espresso machine and it was not a great experience. Somobody had told me that with espresso machines you can either use (moka) Bialetti for $20 or otherwise spend thousands as there was no middle ground. Unfortunately, I believed that story for too long. Eventually I pulled the trigger because I value the Breville brand and I am glad I did. While I continue to like Bialetti moka (more hot coffee), this espresso let me for the first time experience the great taste and aroma of Illy (Classico, beans). That aroma was never present in Bialetti coffees. And I specifically mean Illy. Some other of my favorite coffees (Peet's Major D dark) didn't work that well so far. I'd be curious about Lavazza, Kimbo, Danesi... All of them may require grinding adjustments. The integrated grinder is good, I am not sure a standalone 'upgrade' would make that much of a difference. A few years ago I had a $5k machine at work and a $2k grinder -- the results were NOT better than from my current Barista. BTW, I only use bottled (Poland) water. The one thing that you need to buy for this machine, right away, is a 54mm black plastic funnel, sold here on Amazon for about $15k -- to avoid some mess and small coffee loss from grinding. It works perfectly."

131,4.0,2022-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wanted to step up my espresso quality by moving up to a higher end machine but not to a thousand dollar plus one. There must a level of diminishing returns for all but the most hard core coffee geek. It will take time and effort to get the right dose, grind size and level of tamp pressure. This can be made easier using the double walled filter but you can get that on cheaper machines. Once I got it right I made the best espresso I’ve ever had! The pressure indicator helps to ensure all is good. There are lots of hints on YouTube. The worst issue is that the grinder is really messy. This can be avoided by buying a filter funnel for about twenty bucks. I’d also recommend a knock box to empty the “puck” of used grounds. In fact a solid puck is a good sign of properly brewed espresso. The steaming wand is good but you need to let it drip into the tray until you get a solid jet of steam. Once primed it makes micro foam easy. Even though the unit heats quickly I’d recommend letting it stay on for about 10 minutes with the filter handle on the top to warm up before the heat is ideal. I also recommend running a shot without grounds to warm your cup. If you are new to “proper” high quality machines, like I am, it will be really frustrating with wasted beans and time. But once you’ve figured it out, you’ll have espresso of extremely high quality. Programming the volume of grounds and water for your espresso cup is simple to do. It’s worth the learning curve."
132,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wish I'd invested in this machine earlier! It does espressos so well! The only con is that it takes awhile to steam milk, but other than that it's been a lifesaver! I use it every day."
133,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely love this machine! Have had it for a year and a half now and it still feels just like new. Makes the best lattes and iced coffees!
134,5.0,2022-06-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, he was so surprised and couldnt wait to use it! He went through an entire bag of beans though to get it dialed in just right. Im not as picky as he is, and all my grinds tasted good, even if they were not perfectly timed."
135,5.0,2018-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am an avid espresso drinker. Three or four double espressos per day when I’m home. I tried for years to get away with cheap espresso makers. When the last one finally broke decided to spend the $ and get the real thing. I’m so glad I did! Our morning coffee is on another level now.
136,5.0,2022-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have gone through a few expresso coffee machines and this is by far the best one. Based on other reviews I got the container to nock the coffee grounds into which is very practical
137,4.0,2022-04-24, Black Sesame,Overall great macine but can't understand how it does not have a low water sensor. If you are out of water it will still operate but no espresso. Otherwise no issues.
138,4.0,2014-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,We just received this a few days ago so we have been able to use it a few times now. The machine is pretty nice and the flavor and texture is yummy but my only complaint is that when steaming the milk the sound is o loud and high pitch it hurts my ears and I have to shut the kitchen door so my baby can’t hear it because he cries anytime he hears the machine steaming.
139,5.0,2020-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have had this little workhorse for a few months now. We are still getting accustomed to it. It is loud, but it is an espresso machine, so that should be expected. It heats quickly. We are adjusting the grind coarseness and the amount of beans that are ground at a go to get to that optimal pressure. We drink Americanos more than anything else and the flavor is great. I have a little difficulty turning the knob counterclockwise to get the steamer wand to activate. We don't use it often and my hands are a little weak. I think if we used it more, that would not be a problem. When I have used the steamer, it works well.
It is messy. There are bits of beans that didn't make it into the portafilter, so it requires a regular wipe down, including the floor. But overall, I think it is a great little machine."
140,5.0,2021-12-31, Black Sesame,"This machine has a great grinder, espresso pump and steam wand. All 3 perform great for a home machine specially at this price range. This is my first espresso machine and it saved my morning routine. It is not that easy to clean but no espresso machine is. As a bonus it has a hot water spout for americanos, tea or yerba mate. The reservoir holds just enough water for 2 days for two people.
Operating and espresso machine is a learning curve, this is not a Keurig, you will have to spend time with the manual and watching tutorials, but this will be an awesome journey."
141,4.0,2022-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First I should say that it's a good machine. Works great, easy to use. But I returned mine for two reasons: 1: There's such a thing as too many lattes! It's not a treat anymore when you can make one every day. 2: Wow, it's a loud machine! It makes a noise when you turn it on, when you pour a shot, and when you froth the milk. It takes some practice to learn to froth the milk, and if you get it wrong it makes an awful shriek! I only used pre-ground beans, but I imagine the grinder is pretty loud also. We live in a small house, and my husband usually always sleeps later than me. I can't use it without waking him up!"
142,4.0,2021-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update 2 after servicing, have to say Breville is on top of their customer service. They sent me a label, we shipped it to turn using their label and filled out a label to ship back to us at no cost. Under 2 weeks later we get it back fixed. Very happy with the results despite the grinder repair.

Update 1 after 6 months the grinder will not turn on. Tried the extensive cleaning suggested online but it didn’t fix it. I can’t believe it didn’t last even a year for the price.

Love this machine but it did not hit pressure correctly until I watched a visit on adjusting the grind by moving the pin in the grinder from the default 6, to 4. This is independent of the wheel you use of the left of the machine which I had on 1 and wasn’t grinding fine enough to get pressure properly.

If you aren’t getting pressure it’s easy to fix by adjusting the metal pin in the grinder mechanism!"
143,4.0,2022-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,May 2018 I got this machine in hopes of saving some money on going out for coffee. Well… I did! And with making my lattes at home I’m able to have them at anytime of day I want which comes in handy working in healthcare on evening shift and night shift when everything is closed. Coworkers need a pick me up? Swing by the house on break and whip up a batch of favorites! I did lose my owners manual so I had to Google how to clean the machine. Which is really just a weird button pushing combination. The unit was under $480 when I first got it so the price has gone up quite a bit over the years. However it is a great investment piece for a coffee lovers home.
144,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pros:
-Can work at a small shop
-Built in grinder so you don’t have to buy one ($800+ for a commercial grinder)

Cons:
-You have to refill the reservoir
-Steaming takes awhile

I purchased this as a cheap alternative to commercial espresso machines (this one is for home use) for my small shop. I just needed something that would hold me over until I could afford a real commercial espresso machine ($5,000+) and so far so good!

I’ve had it running in the shop for a month with no issues - the biggest down fall is that you have to refill the reservoir instead of it being plumbed in. I only put filtered water in the machine.

And the steamer can take a while…I would say for me to steam 1 large coffee drink it might take 1 full minute. A double boiler espresso machine (commercial) wouldn’t have this issue but like I said I bought this Breville to hold me over until I could afford something like that.

A few reviews mention it turns off after 15 minutes but that is only if you aren’t using it and is seems to be a bit longer than 15 minutes - I just keep my eye on it and turn it back on if I see it go off

My shop is focuses on smoothies so I might only do 5 coffee drinks an hour but it has been awesome! It is a great alternative for a shop starting out"
145,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"I am so happy I bought the refurbished option for this coffee machine. It came basically new at a killer saving.

This coffee machine makes the coffee so good I do not ever want to go to a coffee shop again. If you decide to purchase this product I definitely recommend for you to watch a few YouTube videos to understand how to find the best recipe for your coffee to taste good since the instruction manual does not go over that."
146,5.0,2022-04-15, Black Sesame,"What a machine! I’ll add photos later. After doing months of research into espresso machines I decided the best option for me was to go with the Breville Barista Express and I don’t regret it. My first try resulted in a well-bodied flavorful and neatly extracted espresso that honestly blew me away. I also have a Flair Pro 2, which I also highly recommend, but you must invest in a nice grinder (I use a timemore hand grinder for it - yes it takes forever).

Pros of this machine:
Grinder built-in: produces a fairly consistent grind and has easy step adjustments)
Cleanliness: I wipe the front down each day with a damp rag, but overall it’s easy to clean. I’ve also cleaned the grinder already using the espresso Grindz and the included brush, works wonderfully. The one drawback is the steam wand, which milk burns to easily, I use a wet sponge to clean it after each use which makes cleaning it a breeze.
Pressure gauge: this makes understanding your extraction super easy if you don’t want to time and weigh your shots.

Cons:
Steaming power: it takes a minute or two to get started after selecting steam, and it’s very slow, I’d say I spend about 1-1:30 minutes steaming milk. It does create great milk texture though, and I’ve had success with dairy and non-dairy milks.
Tamper and distribution razor : the tamper and included razor tool suck, they’re not unusable, they just take a lot of practice to get consistent tamping and distribution. This is incredibly important and I recommend checking out accessories that distribute and tamp easier. The razor is just plain stupid, and I never use it.
Portafilter: the 54mm basket is more forgiving than a 58mm (standard size), which actually makes extraction easier for a beginner; however there’s a plastic piece inside this portafiler that I popped out with a screw driver because that’s silly and unnecessary. As you get used to using it, I recommend looking for a bottomless portafilter. It’ll change your espresso experience for the better.

All in all, if you’re new to espresso and want to play barista get this machine. It’s an all a rounder and amazing value."
147,5.0,2019-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"***UPDATE*** After 16 months of daily use, once per day to make double shots of espresso, this machine gave out. Being outside warranty, the cost of shipping and handling, cost to diagnose the machine, and then replace parts, would at minimum cost nearly 1/2 what this machine cost me when I bought it on sale. What happened? The machine stopped pumping water into the group head with enough power to do an extraction. I kept this machine clean, clean, clean, and even after careful descaling it still would not do the job. I will not be replacing this machine with another Breville. I will not chance it. ***

I owned a Starbuck's Barista espresso machine and it lasted about ten years. It was a durable machine, but it couldn't brew a great espresso because it was underpowered. So, when I gave the Barista machine to the local Goodwill, I began shopping for it's replacement. I wanted a machine that could brew several drinks in a row without any reheating issues or steaming issues. Enter the Breville BES870XL.

I live modestly, but I do like an excellent Almond milk latte. I also like to spend much less money on said latte than what I am charged at the local coffee shop! The Breville BES870XL is a God send! The machine fits nicely on my limited counter space in my very small apartment kitchen. It grinds beautifully and I can whip up wonderful lattes at will. The machine is so easy to use compared to the old Barista. Extraction of the espresso always gives excellent crema (I use Lavazza Super Crema beans) and taste and steaming the milk right after extraction always happens, since the Breville has the water good and hot, ready to go.

The only con is that the grinder is messy. I use a tray to collect the grinds that fall out during collection and also pressing into the basket. But that is really the only issue I have with this machine.

I keep the Breville clean after each brew. Be scrupulous with cleaning and the machine rewards with great tasting brew!

I haven't owned this machine for but a month, so durability is not considered here. However, if the Breville BES870XL lasts as long as my old Barista did, I will be extremely pleased. I would buy this again without thought! Enjoy."
148,5.0,2022-07-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had a Jura super automatic machine for years and then stopped making espresso - the taste was becoming bitter, the machine was a pain to maintain,etc.. Fast forward several years and I got the espresso/latte bug again, and decided I didn't want to go the super automatic route - too many things to break and clean so I researched machines and the Breville had great reviews across the board so I decided to try it. WOW!!! I don't recall the flavor, texture, and overall satisfaction being this high even when I just started using the Jura. The flavor is rich, not bitter (using the same beans I've been using for years), the crema is outstanding and the machine appears to be built like a tank. I'm in love with espresso and latte's again!!!"
149,3.0,2022-07-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine is interesting. It appears easy to use based on easy to read buttons and settings but there is a lot more involved to get a good espresso shot out of this device. Grind quality/amount is the tricky part and will lead you to burn through a lot of espresso beans before you get it just right.

Another challenge is getting the pressure right. I had to send mine in for a repair shortly after getting it because out of the box it was a lemon. The pressure never would climb to ideal range, at times the meter wouldn't even move at all. I just got this machine back yesterday and already it is working better than before but will require some tests to get the settings to personal preference.

The steam wand works but beware it takes a while to heat up milk. The metal cup it comes with will get hot but don't be fooled the milk is likely still just lukewarm. You will have to steam it for a little longer after you can no longer hold your hand to the side/bottom of the cup.

Cleanup is pretty easy. The tray slides out easy and isn't difficult to clean. I bought additional accessories to help in cleaning out the grinder. I do recommend occasionally cleaning out the grinder unless you don't mind remnants from past beans to mix with new batches.

Aside from having to get a repair right away my only other gripe with the device is the height between the base and the steam wand. The metal cup it comes with is small and good for 1 drink at a time. It is much smaller than what usually a barista would use. The standard metal cup baristas would use would not fit with this device.

Unrelated to the device itself, but regarding Breville customer service. They initially had me run a test on the device (a youtube video). When I ran the test and the results did not match what the video said I should get I informed Breville. They responded with a canned response indicating user error. I quickly responded indicating I disagreed with the assessment. I had previously experimented well over 30 espresso shots with zero consistency from the espresso machine. I also explained how the test they told me to run gave me results affirming the machine wasn't working properly. It wasn't until I sent that response that they offered free shipping to have it sent in for repairs. Breville emailed me once that my espresso machine had finished being repaired and was shipped but they didn't provide any sort of tracking, nor did they indicate what issue if any they found in their repairs, only a vague checklist of things they tested.

Overall, I don't think I'd recommend this espresso machine based on how sensitive it is, having a lemon out of the box, and Breville customer service being a bit difficult. It can be nice to have but I'd recommend a different espresso machine that gives a more forgiving and better experience."
150,5.0,2013-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's a whole system. You'll need to read the manual, experiment, and practice for a while but it does make an excellent cup of coffee. It's really convenient having the grinder and coffee maker together in one machine.

I only gave 4 stars for ""Easy to clean"" because I haven't tried to clean it yet, other than the daily wipe-downs and tray emptying."
151,5.0,2022-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I like very much
152,5.0,2020-09-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this for a little over 2 weeks now. Have used it every day for myself and my wife, mostly making cappuccinos and the occasional double-espresso shot before going to the gym. Can this machine produce fine cappucinos and espressos? Absolutely! The cappucinos and espressos I have produced with this machine are as good as any I have ever had in my life including those I have had fine restaurants in the USA and Europe. So far, this machine is consistent. And if you are worried about complexity and break downs, buy the extended warranty and have peace of mind.

However you must consider that the machine is just one component of the formula for a perfect espresso drink. If you want a perfect cappuccino, then you must take care of all of the following:

* The grind, dose and consistent tamp pressure must be tuned for each type of beans you put in the hopper. This can usually be done with 3 or 4 shots and your success is measured by achieving the sweet spot on the extraction pressure gauge.
* Beans are everything! Forget cheap stale beans from Starbucks or your local grocery store that were roasted months or years before you bought them. Expect to pay $20 to $27 a pound for the best freshly roasted beans.You will be well rewarded for your investment.
* Beans are everything #2 .. you need to source FRESHLY roasted beans. There are plenty of excellent online roasters that roast to order. Check out Old Soul Co, Sacramento online for some of the best beans money can buy. Their Sidamo decaf is one of the best coffees I have ever tasted. If you can't find freshly roasted beans, an excellent alternative for regular is ""Danesi Caffe Gold Espresso Beans 2.2 lb Bag"" available here on Amazon.
* Freshly ground beans are essential also. Never use preground coffee, and with this machine you don't have to. If you need to be able to make either decaf or regular, then invest in a standalone grinder such as Breville Smart Grinder Pro and now you have two on-demand grinders - one for decaf and one for regular. Forget the idea of swapping beans in the hopper. It takes too much time and wastes precious beans and requires too much time to adjust grind and dose settings for different bean types.
* Preheat the portafilter by running a single shot through the empty portafilter and DRYING it thoroughly before dispending coffee into it. Preheat cups using boiling water before you start anything.
* Use the included dose control blade to trim dosage for consistency.
* For the perfect steamed milk, go on Youtube and watch some videos on how to steam milk properly ... the technique is easy and makes for a perfect result.
* Process: Pour boiling water in the cups to preheat. Preheat portafilter and dry it. Dispense coffee and insert portafilter. Steam the milk. Pull the espresso shot into the cup. Add the steamed milk. Enjoy!

This machine is excellent value, considering that it includes an excellent on-demand grinder. Would I prefer the the top of the line Breville Oracle? Sure I would, but for the price, this is as good as it gets for a single boiler, grinder built-in machine. And it looks great too!"
153,5.0,2020-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this product for approximately three weeks, so I cannot speak to the longevity of this product (although looking at other reviews and based on the price of this product I did purchase an extended warranty). Having said that, this is by FAR the best purchase I have ever made.

I was a barista for two years, and after that time I know how espresso drinks should taste. Which is why I can tell you that when you make an espresso drink at home it is SO MUCH BETTER than the busy barista at a cafe, or a Starbucks or wherever you get your lattes. I purchased this machine as a graduation present to myself for getting through law school (knowing I would need more caffeine than I've ever consumed in my life to get through bar prep). Despite the steep price this is SO worth it. Especially as someone who was spending $6 on a latte (dairy free, extra shot kinda gal), this thing is going to pay for itself in no time. Literally, I did the math. It's going to take me less than three months.

This machine is EXTREMELY user friendly. It takes a second to figure out how it all works, but it's all pretty intuitive. It also has some self-precaution alerts to clue you in if you're doing something wrong (When the water pan gets too high, it has a little sign that pops up and says, ""empty me!""). I would definitely recommend following the cleaning instructions to the letter (I mean, you're putting a lot of money into this you might as well take care of it the best you can). It's also a very fast process. I can make an iced latte in under a minute from the instant grinding to me taking my first sip.

A caution: this machine can be messy. If you don't have it at the right levels, and even if you do, there will be stray grinds. It's part of the process. My suggestion is to have a designated rag for cleaning that you change out every couple of days. Other than that, I haven't had a single issue with the machine.

In summary, if you have the money now, invest in this machine. It will save you money long-term and you can put exactly what you want into your drinks whether it's your favorite type of milk (for me oat), or you want that extra shot of espresso and don't want to pay $1.25 extra for it."
154,5.0,2022-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We were looking at the Breville machine without the grinder since it was on Cyber Monday special but glad we spent the extra for this. The espresso comes out great every time, the cleanup is easy and the steam wand actually works to froth milk. I used to work at a coffee shop on much more expensive machines and while this may be no where near those, it does produce exceptionally consistent shots and has a pretty high quality feel to it. My wife was at first concerned it may be too complicated but running through it a few times teaches you everything you need to know and it’s quick to operate. What I really like about this is the level of thought that went into it. They really did think about everything in this machine. The bottom grate removes easy and is split into a coffee grind collector and water tray that catches and extra steam runoff or missed espresso if you don’t get cups directly under the portafilter.

Pros:
- High quality shots every time
- High build quality and easily cleaned everything
- Automatic grind feature is really nice and avoids another device on the counter
- Steam wand is one of the better ones on a home unit

Cons:
- Breville recommended grind amounts were way too much. We dialed ours back to 1/4th rather than half way as recommended and waste a lot less Espresso. However your results may vary.
- The Breville razor is kinda useless. If you get the grind amount right I’ve noticed that the included tamper marks about the same level if you line up it’s metal tamper with the rim of the portafilter
- Having multiple portafilter caps is nice but we find unnecessary. 99% of the time you’re gonna use the one for two shots with whole bean coffee, though it’s nice to have in a pinch if you have to get preground.
- This machine requires water filters every two months. This isn’t really a con but more so inconvenient. The benefit of this, though, is a cleaner machine so it’s the least concerning. Also the filters and cleaning tablets are pretty cheap.

All and all I’d highly recommend this machine for those in the market. It may be more expensive than others but produces a far better quality product."
155,3.0,2022-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For starters, I am a big Breville fan and I own the Breville infuser. Mine has worked well for two years now and makes outstanding coffee. I recently pitched in with my father-in-law to by my mother-in-law the Barrista Express. The function is basically identical to mine, so I set it up for them yesterday.

I immediately noticed a problem with the pull. The gauge was not going up and it ""heated"" up way too quick. On mine, it takes 30 seconds or so to heat up, the Barrista did it within 2-3 seconds (i.e., way to quick). The pull was very off, no creme', and lots of air bubbles.

I tinkered with the grind ( to make it finer) and tried everything I could think of. Eventually, I would try course(est) grind, finest grind, mess with the amounts of coffee in the group head, etc. I made sure water came out of the holding tank appropriately, it did; I tried reseting the machine, no luck; and I cleaned it thoroughly (even with the tablets in ""clean mode"") and took off the screen to make sure it was clear and clean. Everything external looked good to go but nothing worked. After multiple pulls, 2 to 3 hours, and a 1/2 bag of beans, I gave up.

Then my father in law asked about the tea feature. On mine, it comes out in a continuous stream and fills an 8 once mug before it shuts off automatically. On his, it sputtered and spit before shutting off after putting out 2 oz of water. We confirmed with a measuring cup.

We did some research and found out that our machine had symptoms of a bad thermocouple and/or sensor.

He called customer service today and got ahold of someone. They walked him through all the standard steps but nothing worked for him. He plans to send it back tomorrow to Breville.

I am SUPER disappointed because it is inconvenient, especially given that it is a high dollar item. I'd expect to take it out of the box, follow the set up instructions, and be pouring perfect coffee within 10-15 minutes. Now we have to go through all of this hassle to get a working machine back from the factory.

It is worth mentioning the machine seemed to be perfectly packaged and I saw no evidence that we were receiving a machine that had been previously opened, let alone used (i.e., all tape was in the right spot, bags were sealed, etc.). There was no damage to the box upon arrival and the machine ""looked"" flawless.

Like I said, I own a Breville and love it. This one was a huge dud though. I think if it was a working machine, I would give it 5 stars (+). The grinder (the added feature on this vs. mine) is fantastic. I am sure once we get a working machine, we will be singing its praises but not this one. Hope this helps.

I just reviewed this post and would be remiss if I did not make an update - 11/18/2020

After that debacle described above, the in-laws did receive a working machine and they use it daily. I do not remember the specifics other than it was a hassle (i.e, I could not tell you if it took a week to resolve or a month). I can tell you also that I still have my Breville and it still pours a mean cup of coffee. Looking back, would I still buy a Breville from Amazon? Yes."
156,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased 8/2019 grinder no longer works and the vibratory pump is going to need to be replaced soon. I have a La Pavoni Professional that I have used for 20 years that is still going strong so maybe my expectations for durability are set too high. It makes decent espresso and for $450, it was a cheap way to not have to pull the lever every morning on the La Pavoni. In retrospect, I should have gone with a Prosumer machine (ECM, Rocket) since I have a Mazzer grinder (20 years old) and my kids would be using it when I’m long gone. Now that the Breville is $700, it would be hard to make a value proposition case for it.
Pro: Heats up quickly, built in grinder, comes with everything you need, simple operation, well thought out
Con: durability, underpowered steam wand, vibratory pump can’t handle back to back espresso pulls"
157,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This breville espresso machine is AMAZING it has pre infusion (which only really High end machines have), has a built in grinder, and a built in tamper. It also has an Empty now sign when your water tray gets to full. The only difficult thing is if you switch your coffee you usually have to change the grind setting which isn't that big of a deal seeming how I am a Barista I love this at home machine."
158,3.0,2022-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After my Siemens EQ.7 plus super-automatic died after five years of use, I thought I should upgrade my espresso-making capabilities. I was getting tired of the way the Siemens injected a lot of water into my lattes, and I had been impressed with a friend who produced great coffee with her Rancilio Silvia, so I perused the offerings on Amazon. This Breville has by far the best reviews, so I took the plunge and bought one.

I have had the machine for about a week. In that time, I have read the manual and made perhaps 20-30 drinks for myself and friends. I have watched a lot of Youtube videos describing how to foam milk properly.

All in all, this machine is a huge upgrade over the super-automatics. I had one friend tell me that I am producing better lattes than Starbucks. I think so too.

But there are some things you should know that might not be obvious if you are reading this and contemplating a purchase of an espresso machine.

This machine is an entry level machine. It has the following limitations:

1. First and foremost, the single boiler is small. This means that the machine cannot brew the espresso and steam milk at the same time. Generally, you would want to do this in order to get the coffee and milk ready at the same time. Better machines have two boilers: One for the coffee, and one for the steam. In increasing order of cost, the Rocket R58 is popular, or the La Marzocco Linea Mini or GS3. These machines also offer you more control over the brewing and steaming process, again in increasing order.

2. The steam pressure is not very strong, which means it takes a long time for the steam to come on, and a long time for the milk to get up to 70C. The result is that it can take quite a while to produce your drink. You have to wait for the machine to warm up (30 seconds), you have to flush the steam wand with water, and you have to wait for the steam to finally start spraying.

3. Key to consistent espresso extraction is that the coffee is tamped down to a consistent pressure every time. For this, you will need a calibrated tamper, which is not included. If you get this machine, be sure to buy a 53 mm calibrated tamper.

4. This may seem like a nitpick, but to get the amount of ground coffee in the portafilter that the manual indicates, you will not be able to just grind coffee and tamp it down. The amount of coffee required to be tamped down will overflow the portafilter. Thus, you will have to grind, tamp, and then grind and tamp a couple more times to get the correct amount of tamped coffee in the portafilter. It would have been better if the designers had made sure that the required amount of untamped coffee actually fit in the Portafilter.

I have not had the machine so very long, and I will update. All in all, this is a fine machine for a novice, home user with friends who don't know much. If you are truly serious about espresso, you will want to buy a machine with two boilers that can steam and brew simultaneously and powerfully. You will also need to invest in a serious grinder, which the La Marzocco and Rocket machines do not come with.

I will keep my Breville and attempt to live with the limitations. With a calibrated tamper and a lot of patience and some trickery, it will probably produce great espresso drinks."
159,4.0,2021-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this for my husband, after doing several weeks of research. I chose this particular machine for its quality, range of features and ease-of-use, as we are both beginners in the barista field. I've had none of the issues posed in some of the other reviews (i.e. the machine seems to be getting good pressure, it's responding to adjustments, it heats quickly and evenly, etc.). I am having issues with extraction. I've played with it a million times and its not being consistent, but I honestly am faulting the beans (I haven't yet made it to the local roasters, so I am using sub-par beans) and my lack of skills.

Someone already left a really, really thorough review (I'd highly recommend that one, as it was super helpful) so I am going to try to avoid redundancy here and just add a few additional notes/reminders to be aware of:

1) Make sure you keep the water level up. There is no obvious indicator to notify you when it's too low. It may just appear the machine is over-extracting.
2) Keep a wet rag handy for the steam wand immediately after steaming milk. No matter how quick you are, there will always be milk scorched onto the wand and it takes a wet rag and some considerable friction to remove it.
3) Have a good supply of beans on hand for when you first get this machine, as you WILL have some throw-away extractions in the beginning when you're adjusting the settings.

Lastly, someone said it was really loud in their review (something about waking flat-mates and what-not). This is an exaggeration to say the least; or there is simple something wrong with their machine. The machine is fine and does not disturb anyone sleeping when in use.

Overall, I am happy with it. I will be sure to update my review down the line and report on its continued performance.

PRO TIP: If you don't use the Honey plug-in, I urge you to use it! I added this to Droplist to track the price and it notified me when it dropped by $100 for only one single day. It tracked it across multiple sites and was sooooo worth waiting for the savings. :) So, if you're not in a hurry, set it and wait for the price to drop. You can also see the full price history and the time periods in which the price jumps."
160,5.0,2022-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife gave me a gift for Father's Day last year. I still use it every day. The coffee is very tasty. It works without problems, although we make three to six servings daily. I would buy this again if needed. I recommend to all."
161,4.0,2022-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had the starbucks espresso machine for going on 10 years now, been a very reliable beast but was ready for an upgrade and wanted a dosing grinder to make the process easier. The Breville has been great so far and it make a great espresso shot. I drink either a capucinno or americano so not hiding the flavor behind carmel chocolate whip (really people, that is a coffee flavored milkshake, not an espresso). Couple of observations. You gotta read the instructions (gasp). It takes a little doing to get grind fineness, volume and tamping pressure right to get the shot to shot to come out in the target pressure range but it is worth a little time in great shot. If you are looking for a very automated experience this is probably not your beast. I like a little hands on and this is the perfect mix of easy with some handcrafting. on dosing, I'm cheap and hate to waste coffee and have found that if I let it fill the portofilter to the full setting coffee falls over the sides so I fill it about 75%, tamp a little bit then fill the rest of the way by sight and finish tamping. Not really that hard to guage once you get the feel for it. BTW, I find I need to tamp pretty firmly to get the shot such that it will run at the right perssure. People have complained in reviews about oilyer coffees getting hung up in grinder. Ive had this happen and now I tend to just give the bean hopper a tap before each shot and it has been fine. Might be a pain with a really oily bean but so far so good. I've also used it at coarser grind to do a pour over cup but if you want to change beans for that coffee, not super easy so might want to just have a separate grinder for non espresso roasts. I can't say a lot about the steamer, I've used it a few times for making my cappuccino foam but I must confess those spinner devices, of which I have, are easier and more reliable. Purist don't hate me! I hope the long term reliability of the machine and grinder is good because so far I've been super happy. I am on the hunt for a base that allows sliding machine forward to get out from under upper cabinet to make water refill and bean refill less difficult. If you know of one please share!"
162,5.0,2022-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"One of the best coffee machines I owned. Had this model for well over a year now, and it still works as good as when I purchased it.

For reference, I had Thermador and Miele before, about 7 and 10 years ago. Both are in much higher price range than this one, but this one makes better coffee than what you would get at Starbucks in my opinion. I like the manual option of inserting the fresh coffee grind instead of automatic, and that makes the difference. I use the single filter shown in the picture.

There are a ton of other more detailed reviews here, so I am not going to waste yours or mine time. One improvement that I made is cutting off the groove from one side of the Main tray. Every time you take the main tray out to wash, it catches the smaller tray for tool storage, that you never use, and it gets annoying. You need a very sharp nice to cut it off (your choice, obviously), similar to the one I showed in the picture. BE VERY CAREFUL while performing this to not cut yourself. Use common sense.

All the best! Enjoy your coffee!"
163,4.0,2022-06-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine and it makes great espresso beverages. I was upgrading from a Breville Nespresso machine because I wanted to expand the variety of beans that I could use for coffee.

I also bought a separate Breville grinder (in addition to the one on the machine) because my wife and I drink different coffee and it was a pain to keep switching out the extra bins that I bought.

So why 4 stars instead of 5? Three reasons:

1. The milk frother on this is manual - you have to sit there and hold the cup and do everything by hand. The Nespresso that I was upgrading from does everything automatically. Maybe there is some reason somebody would want to manually froth milk everyday, but the Nespresso does it just fine and I have to just press one button and walk away. The higher end models of this machine have the better milk frother - the same as the Nespresso. Paying an extra $300 to get a better brother is stupid, when I paid less than that for the Nespresso. So, the net of it is that I just use my Nespresso machine for frothing and this for making the espresso.

2. It does not come with any shot cups for the espresso. You can't really fit a coffee mug under the portafilter, so this just feels like a dumb thing to leave out.

3. The bean hoppers from this machine are not compatible with the grinder I bought. So I cannot have 3 or 4 different hoppers full of beans and put them on whichever grinder I would like _ I can only rotate on this machine. I don't understand why you would not make these compatible - for all kinds of reasons. Like manufacturing, product compatibility, easier engineering, and CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

But overall, I am really glad I bought this."
164,5.0,2022-07-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really like the espresso I am able to brew with this machine, which has also turned out to be very sturdy and reliable. The only drawback is the attention needed for drawing shots, which can be an issue when there is not much time in the morning.

Given that Starbucks no longer makes their Verismo pods, and the Starbucks Nespresso pods have an unplesant metallic taste found in all Nespresso coffees and roasts, there is a need for Breville to create a super automatic espresso machine that produces an excellent expresso like this with a dark oily whole bean like Starbucks' Espresso and French Roast.

Pros:

- Total control over all aspects of the coffee drink making process.

- Able to replicate, with practice, any espresso drink made by a barista in a coffee shop.

- May use any coffee beans, even the oily dark roast coffees one is warned against using in the ""super automatic"" machines currently available (they recommend dry, medium roast, coffee beans).

- Coffee grinder built in for the best possible brew.

- Very reliable and consistent machine.

- Able to make many repairs oneself as parts like gaskets wear out. (See YouTube for DIY videos).

- Patience and practice will lead to many varied and extraordinary coffee experiences.

Cons:

- If new to using an espresso machine, it will take some time to learn how to make the basic espresso/coffee that you will want to drink everyday (be sure to watch the pressure gauge when pulling shots, and when frothing milk, use a thermometer at first).

- It takes more time and attention to pull a shot of espresso than other home coffee methods."
165,5.0,2022-06-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Once you read the manual and understand the settings, this becomes easy to use.
If you are a novice to a machine like this, be sure that you read all the material that comes with it. My husband did help me put it together, as I was a little confused. It can be difficult for some(if you have never looked at one of these machines), but it’s definitely worth learning!

This machine does not come with the little shot glasses to hold the espresso. But you can use a small coffee cup that works just as well. I bought a “knock box” to put the used grinds in, but you don’t need that. You could just use a bowl and dump it out. I just let the grounds accumulate before I dump them out, but it really doesn’t matter(and my Breville knock box takes up a lot of counter-space).

I can’t stress this enough: there are a lot of different settings that yield different results with this machine. If you want to make the coffee hotter, if want to get less/ more espresso out of either shot setting, you have to know how to do that. It’s more complex than it seems but once you read and program, it’s amazing, coffeehouse results!

If like adding milk, which most of us do, make sure that you’re getting the barista form of whichever milk you like best( Barista cow’s milk, oat, almond, etc.) because it does better with the heat than regular milk.

One of the most important things when making your espresso shots, is the temperature gauge. That temperature gauge should move to halfway or you won’t have proper espresso strength.

I love this and have bought some Skinny syrups. I make lattes and espressos for my family almost daily!"
166,3.0,2022-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ok. I had my previous breville machine for over 10 yrs and it's still running! I had some issues with my grind and 2 yrs ago thought it would die (it didn't, I handed it down and it's still being used daily). That's why we upgraded to the barista express. We can't really go without our morning coffee (LO is espresso and mine is Americano).

About a yr into buying it, we noticed a hairline crack in the protafilter handle. Granted it was probably there well before us noticing it as it was truly hairline and you'd have to see it in the right light and angle to notice it. My bad and I didn't call breville right away since it was 2020 and lots of other things were on my mind. Well, earlier this year I called them (still a hairline crack) and they said there's nothing they can can do as the warranty is one yr and no exceptions. I was truly disappointed as it's obviously a quality issue. The machine has been truly cared for as it was a splurge for us. Anyways, yesterday, the portafilter handle broke.

I guess for an average buyer, is the coffee good? Yes! Is it easy to use? Yes! It is 'smart' to indicate cleaning/descaling? Yes! So overall, I have it 3 stars. The coffee is great and it does it's job. Why did I knock TWO whole stars instead of one? Well, it's mainly 1 down for quality (especially since I had an expectation coming in having had my old machine and knowing it's still running daily) and the other star down is for customer service. The only other brand I ever contacted for customer service in my kitchen appliances was ninja and ninja was 110 times better in every way they handled my concern. For what I consider a premium brand, breville really lacked in that customer service.

If you are coming as a returning breville customer like I am, you'll be disappointed in lower quality (even the stainless steel is lower grade than our previous breville). But if you're new to the brand, it may be a better product."
167,5.0,2022-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is our third Barista Express machine.
The first was a BES860XL. When the grinder stopped working we gave it to a friend.
The second was a BES870XL. The mechanism that automatically stops the extraction after enough water or time has passed is not working consistently. After we get this one repaired we will take it to a lake cottage that a friend has.
We purchased this third machine so we don't have to go without espresso while waiting for the second machine to be repaired.
This latest is a BES870XL/B. It was not grinding the beans fine enough. I set the grind dial on the side of the machine to its finest setting (1), but no matter how much pressure I applied while tamping, I could barely get the pressure into the ""Espresso Range"" on the meter.
While cleaning the machine to return it, I noticed on the upper burr of the grinder embossed numbers and the legend ""<--Finer Coarser-->"". So, I looked at the instruction book, and there is a new page that wasn't in the old book. In our book it is page 23 titled, ""Adjusting Conical Burrs"".

The upper burr dial came from Breville set at 6. I set the upper burr dial to 2 and set the side dial to 5. I am now able to grind, tamp and extract our espresso the way we've become used to with our second machine.

For the record, I try to get the needle on the pressure gauge between the third ""S"" in ""Espresso"" and the ""N"" in ""Range"", with the favored point being the ""R"" in ""Range"".

So, if you are used to one of the older Barista Express models, be aware of the new upper burr adjustment function.

Breville needs to update their instruction book to refer to this new page in the ""Espresso only drips from portafilter spouts or not at all"" and the ""Espresso runs out too quickly"" entries in the ""Troubleshooting"" section."
168,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I use this machine every day and am so glad I purchased this model, after having researched several. I had a Swiss made Solis model that lasted for years, and once it broke down, I couldn't find a repair shop that could fix it in the US. So I decided to research what was on the market currently that could replace my beloved Solis machine, and the BES870XL was my middle range choice in terms of price and features. Fortunately, it went on sale and I made the decision to purchase. I already have a separate grinder, but I have grown to appreciate the one that is part of this model. Once you have the grind setting perfected in terms of amount and size, there is no need to reset, and it's consistent every time. A downside to having the grinder attached is that it doesn't quite fit on my counter with upper cabinets, so I advise those considering this machine to make sure to measure the distance of your countertop to under cabinet height before you decide to buy this model. This is a heavy machine and not one you'll want to move around a lot.

This is not the machine to buy if you want one that makes lattes just by pushing a button. This is a machine for those who actually like the experience of crafting their espresso drink, as well as have the time and patience to do so. In terms of setup, it did take me about 2 full days of fiddling and experimenting to get the settings where I like them and can produce a consistent light crema. The steamer works well when making foam, and perhaps that is because the stainless steel wand always seems to do a better job than the mixed plastic and metal wands on other models. I learned to steam foam years ago on an old stainless steel Italian made espresso machine, and this one comes pretty close in terms of quality and experience. The machine itself is constructed of a mixture of stainless steel and plastic, but it doesn't seem to impact the quality of the drink. I guess Breville designed it with the metal where its necessary and put plastic into the rest of the design to make it more affordable.

My only issue with my particular machine is that it doesn't produce a full shot when set on the single setting, but it does produce 2 full shots when set to double. (This may not be the case with all machines, but I thought I would put it out there in case it is a quirk with this model.) So to compensate, I just pull 2 shots and have the option to use one or both shots whenever I make my morning lattes. For a mid-range espresso machine, I think it's worth the money, especially if you enjoy crafting the drink yourself."
169,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've owned this machine for four months now and like it more every day. I spent weeks researching my options and decided that this fit right into my sweet spot of price and control. I am no barista and have not tried other machines so can't say how the Breville compares to other machines but I still could not be happier with my choice.

The built in burr grinder is a great convenience and overall the machine provides just enough control in the key areas - grind dosage, grind fineness, water temperature, and, of course, tamp pressure - to allow you to experiment with your approach to get the best tasting espresso for your tastes from a given bean. Having never made espresso at home before I've really enjoyed the process of experimenting with different beans and finding the dose, fineness, and temperature that produces the best drink. I have a new-found appreciation for the coffee bean and it's many varieties. It's also been eye opening to discover how different one cup can be from the next as you change the variables. And in my opinion this machine makes a really tasty shot of espresso. Of course, it can also make a miserable cup of coffee if you make a mistake in the process, but that's part of the fun in my mind.

If you are looking for a machine that does everything for you this is not it. Nor is it the machine that will allow you to control every last element of the process. But it's a great middle ground for folks who are interested in being involved in the process but don't want to spend over $1000 on an espresso machine.

The only thing that keeps this from being five stars is the noise. It is not a quiet machine. At start-up, while pulling the shot, and using the steam wand the machine makes a good bit of noise and vibrates the counter top (which rattles my toaster, but I have nowhere else to put it). As long as everyone is awake in the house it's not a problem but if you have bedrooms close to your kitchen (or are living with two people in a studio apartment) the machine could potentially wake your slumbering partner/child. it's unlikely that you'll be able to surprise anyone with a cup of espresso in bed as the machine will announce your intentions.

Pros:
- In the sweet spot of price and control
- Just enough control for you to experiment with the process and learn more about the coffee as you go
- Makes a really tasty cup of coffee once you get the process down
- Built in burr grinder makes for a tidy package and one less thing to buy

Cons:
- Can be noisy.
- A nit-pick: While the magnetized tamper is nifty in terms of packaging it's not the most comfortable to use with its small, squared off handle.
- Another nit-pick: the lack of double boiler means you have to wait a bit for the steam to come.
- Not a con in my mind but may be for some: This machine does not automatically and inevitably make a great shot of espresso. You have to be willing to find the settings that make the best shot (and to buy good beans). But if you are, then you will be rewarded with an excellent espresso."
170,4.0,2022-05-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The grinder and espresso making gets 5 stars. I really love almost everything about this machine. One thing that disappoints a bit is the steamer wand. It takes a bit long to produce the steam, but what’s most annoying is the valve to turn the steam on/off. The movement is so stiff that it can’t be turned with one hand. Difficult to use when one has a small metal milk pitcher in one had."
171,5.0,2022-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"1 year later and I still think this was the best appliance I bought! Amazon sometimes let you buy things on a 5 month plan, and figured it would be worth the monthly payment for it. After 3 months I made enough Americanos where I hit the break even price on the machine and accessories! (3.5 average per day between my girlfriend and I)

I highly recommend getting a scale, I bought beans from Stumptown coffee, and use 12-13 grams per double shot. Learning to tamp consistently without a scale is super challenging. With other medium/darker roasts I'll use 15-16 grams. You'll likely end up wasting a bag of beans learning to tamp correctly. Its best to stick to one type, since beans can vary in oiliness widely and tamping pressure/grind amount needs vary. Also, don't stress out too much about the 25 to 35 second rule of thumb. As long as the pressure guage is generally in the middle you'll enjoy your shot.

The espresso shots are also much better than the coffee shop across the street, but they cater to the older community members who like darker roasts.

The cons of the machine is the learning curve, super frustrating throwing out a wasted shot (but worth it eventually!) and the steam wand takes a moment to warm up, but I was used to the espresso machines at my restaurant job, which were a few thousand dollars more than this machine. I recommend letting the steam wand run for a bit before putting it in your milk. Watch videos on proper steaming techniques. Other than speed of the milk heating up, it should be the same technique as more expensive machines.

Oh and expect to run a descale cycle every two months and a cleaning cycle every month. I suggest buying the cleaning stuff (and water filters) in bulk rather than the 2,4 or 6 pack options.

The machine's hot water dispenser is also great for tea, but its definitely not boiling hot water, so if you tend to forget you made tea, it might just be warm water after you remember."
172,5.0,2021-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this for myself a few years ago and then another for my mother recently to up her espresso experience. It is priced well (especially on sale) and doesn’t take up a lot of counter space when you consider it includes a grinder. Sufficiently straight forward that I could get my mom dialed in to pulling a good shot quickly. Not as simple as some super automatics or a drip coffee machine (but the taste is way better than drip).

Flavor is very good with good beans and setting the right grind.

The water reservoir is about 2 liters and how long it lasts depends on how many shots, how much steam and hot water you use but I can get a few days out of it with two of us in the house drinking espressos.

Maintenance is pretty easy. It tells you when it needs cleaning and descaling. Keep the manual handy for that since it is infrequent enough that I can’t remember the right button sequence but the manual is clear so no worries.

Clearly I would buy again. I did so for my mother. Mine has been running everyday for two years."
173,1.0,2022-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased November 2013.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (September 2015): This machine has just enough functionality for me to consistently pull God shots as long as my beans are fresh and I choose the right grind. I have had this machine for nearly two years pulling 1-2 shots a day, and it has been quite reliable until now. I maintain and clean it regularly. However, recently it has started to vibrate loudly when I am pulling shots, and I think the pump may be failing. Many other people in online forums have complained of buzzing noises just before their unit failed. I am contacting Breville to see if they can help me identify and fix the problem. I paid over half a grand for this machine, so I'm hoping they can help! If you spend over $500 on an espresso machine, I imagine you want it to last at least 5 years if not 10.

UPDATE # 1 (November 2015): Breville replaced my machine with a refurbished machine (Certified Remanufactured).

UPDATE # 2 (December 2015): Replacement machine 1 started sharing the same problems as the original. Over the past few days it has also started to make rattling noises and sometimes it cannot generate sufficient pressure. As before, I have been decalcifying monthly and using the water filters, even pre-filtering the water before I put it in. I have also been cleaning the unit with the tablets whenever the Clean Me light turns on.

UPDATE # 3: (January 2016): Received replacement machine 2 (certified remanufactured) from Breville. Machine makes loud rattling noises but works OK.

UPDATE # 4 (March 2016): I have received two replacement machines under warranty after the original machine and the first replacement stopped working due to a manufacturing or design defect. The third machine (replacement machine 2) has now also stopped working. I have done the backflush cleaning with the tablets every time the Clean Me light comes on. I have decalcified (with vinegar) on a monthly basis without fail. I have pre-filtered the water with a high-end Stage 4 filter before putting it in the tank, and I have even used the carbon filter in the tank too. I am afraid I now must update my review to 1 star. Breville has great customer service, but this particular machine design is not one I would recommend if you plan on making espressos for more than a few months. You can find videos of my failing machines and the rattling noises on YouTube.
Description of the symptoms:
Sounds:
- “Wao-wao wao-wao” whining sounds, especially during pre-infusion, and usually occurring the instant I touch the button
- Uncharacteristic rattling, sometimes right when I press the button, and also sometimes during the “extraction” phase
Sights:
- No water exiting into cup, regardless of whether there are grounds or not in the portafilter, and regardless of how many times I press the button
- Pressure shown as zero or very low on pressure gauge
- Small amounts of steam squirting out of the steam wand when I’m making coffee
- Water collection tray fills with water although no water comes out the portafilter, indicating that perhaps that the water may be leaking into the bottom of the machine.

UPDATE # 5 (April 2016): I again contacted Breville, and they agreed to take the machine in for repair. They agreed to pay the shipping costs. Once again, bravo for the good customer service!

UPDATE # 6 (May 2016): I received the repaired machine, but found immediately that the repair had been unsuccessful! Makes you wonder if they actually tried to fix it, or if they just did routine maintenance and sent it right back. I again contacted Breville, and they agreed to examine the machine a second time.

UPDATE # 7 (June 2016): The machine was returned again, but the grinder was returned broken (or not reassembled properly). I can no longer change the grind size by turning the knob. No matter which grind size I select, I always get coarse grinds. I carried out a thorough cleaning of the grinder to be sure, to no effect. I contacted Breville, who refused to service or replace the unit due to the out of warranty status, but instead offered me a 35% discount off the purchase of a new machine under $1000. I insisted and posted several videos of the problem on YouTube. I even tried taking apart the grinder myself to fix it, but Breville wouldn't give me a parts list or assembly diagram, so I couldn't really figure it out on my own.

UPDATE # 8 (July 2016): I kept insisting, and finally (miraculously), Breville agreed to send me a replacement (certified remanufactured) machine. Thank you, Breville, for accepting responsibility for the quality and workmanship of your products! I am now using Dezcal instead of vinegar for decalcifying. Otherwise, I will maintain this machine well (as before) and see how it goes. Wish me luck!"
174,5.0,2021-09-08, Black Sesame,"I was looking for filters and saw some of the reviews on this and thought I should share my thoughts on it as well. I have had this machine for over three years. This is a great workhorse, but you have to be willing to do maintenance as with all machines. I have looked at some of these reviews about the longevity of this machine. This machine will last a long time but you have to be willing to clean out the filters etc. It can be hard to find the information on this and I found YouTube to be really helpful for this. You also have to be willing to adjust the grind setting and water timing according to your beans and tastes. It has helped that I was a professional barista for five years, but it is not absolutely necessary. There’s lots of information to find on this. My I opinion is that this machine strikes the perfect balance between allowing the user to adjust for taste and not having it be too complicated and pretty automatic once you get it dialed in. But again you have to be willing to dial it in and do the maintenance. Machines have to be maintained. You don’t expect your car to run without oil and gas. If you think this will last forever without any care perhaps visiting coffee shops is what will work best for you."
175,2.0,2022-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I never write product reviews...this one is the exception. I simply thought I'd share my experience in the event it may assist others in their decision making.

Santa brought us this on Christmas of 2019. Initially, I was pleased with the investment. Granted it lacked the power and feature set of more costly ""prosumer"" espresso machines, but, for the price, I was pretty impressed. I was able to get it dialed in and pulling relatively tasty shots fairly quickly. Invested in a few after market items like a new tamper, distribution tool and funnel which improved consistency a bit. All things considered, not a bad little unit.

Then one day, about 2 months in, a loud snap/pop from the grinder set the grind size dial moving freely; the unit lacked the ability to hold the grind size constant and the grinder ratcheted horribly. After complete disassembly, inspection and reassembly I contacted Breville. To their credit, they contacted me rather expediently and, after a quick review of my description and video clip, authorized me for a new replacement unit, which I received relatively quickly. Customer service answered several questions, though I can't say the responses were overly warm or service oriented in tone. At least I had a functioning replacement.

Again, about 6 weeks later I experienced the same issue with the grinder. I had to completely recalibrate the grind size and dosing, as the unit seemed to be grinding incredibly fine, and suddenly retaining a tremendous amount of grounds. I followed Breville's prescribed cleaning process, but to no avail. I contacted Breville 3 times via email with a detailed description of the issue, but never received a reply. Calling their support line only produced some pre-recorded message that didn't give me any options to talk to a human being. I always like to assume the best - everyone is busy and I appreciate that customer service is a challenging occupation- but after all of my multiple attempts to their primary support email and line, I'm left to assume that they've elected to stop responding in hopes that I ""go away"".

Today, I find myself using the same unit, having altered my grind and dosage settings to get the yield I want and produce a decent shot. That said, I am thoroughly fed up with this unit. I noticed the steam output of the unit to generally be on the decline over the past 3 or so months; it is nothing like the floor model we saw at a local coffee gear reseller's showroom and it has become increasingly finicky. I preemptively descaled the unit, cleaned the wand tip, changed filters, use the same bottled water source time and time again. Brand new, this unit could produce a very respectable cappuccino foam, though I find myself routinely, now, trying to steam a pitcher of milk, only to find it completely devoid of foam and entirely too thin. I'll try a second pitcher only to yield the same results. No matter how hard I try I can not produce anything that will even begin to mark the crema's surface, and this is not for lack of knowledge or ""know how"". The unit, simply put, seems to be a sub-par and incredibly frustrating version of what I initially received.

So, to summarize, were I to never have had any of these issues, I'd give this 4 or 5 stars for being a great little compromise on a respectable at home, entry level semi-automatic espresso machine. I give it 2 stars simply to be fair in the event that my emails are all in the black hole of cyberspace somewhere and that Breville would have sent me a 3rd unit in hopes that it would be free of defect. Frankly, I wish I could simply get a refund. I can in no way recommend the product or offer a vote of confidence in the long term service provided by the company. I am saving for and should have spent the extra $1,000 - $1,500 on a respectable unit from the get go, but now I know. Take my experience with a grain of salt...yours may be different...it's for you to decide whether you want to roll the dice on a $700 experiment with the product and Breville's service department. If you read through the negative reviews, you'll find those mirroring my own. Buyer beware."
176,5.0,2020-09-05, Black Sesame,"We bought ourselves this model a little over three months ago, based on reviews here, The Wirecutter, and a few coffee aficionado sites. We have yet to find another machine that matches the features and ease-of-use at such an attractive price.

While it takes a while to get the grind setting and amount just right, the process of getting there is simple enough to follow and is well worth the one-time effort of at most an hour. Keep the machine clean and you'll have a lovely espresso drink whenever you like, with little effort.

I make one or two doubles in the morning, and one or two singles after lunch each day, and the quality rivals the best coffee shops in town. Anyone - beginner or seasoned expert - can make a great espresso with the 870xl. Just be sure to use good, fresh beans; get the grind right for the beans you're using, and keep the machine clean.

Having the burr grinder built in, with the ability to easily change the grind settings and amount, was worth the extra cost over the model without the built-in grinder.

Cleaning Issues - Solved
I did recently run into an issue where the de-scaling light stayed on even after three successive de-scalings. I was following the instructions from several YouTube videos on de-scaling this particular model. After searching for my particular problem, I found a message board that claimed I was probably doing the chemical cleaning incorrectly, too. According to this board, my cleaning disk lacked a required hole to allow the dirty water to pass through.

I called Breville Support, who said the newer versions (I bought ours in December 2018) indeed now used the hole-less cleaning disk included with my machine, and slightly different cleaning and de-scaling processes, both detailed in the instructions (had I read them). They walked me through the process while on the phone - the problem solved in minutes.

The newer-model cleaning and descaling processes are much simpler and effective than the older versions of this same model. If you're having any trouble with the machine in this regard, check your instruction manual first, not the YouTube videos.

This is our fourth Breville small appliance, and only the first time we called support. Needless to say, we've quite happy both with the Breville machines and their customer support."
177,5.0,2019-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Since we started using this new coffee machine, we stopped going to Starbucks honestly. Coffee tastes really good is fresh every time due to the beans being ground on the spot."
178,5.0,2022-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First impressions since I just got it, and only used it for a couple of times. First things first, it arrived double boxed and actual product box was in neat condition. Machine is brand new. I can’t believe I saw a review from someone claiming that the machine arrived used with residue coffee grinds and scratches. That must sucks but thankfully not my experience. To me this is a high end machine for a espresso beginner like me and so glad I got it for less than the typical $700 price tag. I added the protection plan too so some peace of mind there. My current coffee beans are dark roasted and oily so it was kind of tricky to find the right maybe not perfect but considerably right grind size. Lots of trial and error until I felt like I had dialed in a good size. Also had to mess with the grind amount. I started with the recommended setting of 3 o’clock and oh boy that wasn’t right at all for my beans. Anyways just keep in mind that you have to spend some time adjusting if you’re using whole beans and a non pressurized basket. The steam wand is awesome and works great. Please don’t make my mistake even though I know I have to wipe the wand immediately I got distracted and took longer than I should have to wipe clean the wand so it got messy but got it cleaned up good now. The hot water dispenser is so convenient to quickly warm up cups. It has that preinfusion feature and also the one that removes the excess of water from your group head and leaves you with a dry puck. Those are excellent features. Overall again first impressions are excellent. This looks like a high quality machine to me and I hope to see it work well for me for years to come. Maybe on the high maintenance side but oh well I will do my beat to keep clean and we’ll maintained. Cheers!"
179,1.0,2021-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"******UPDATE!********

We have had this machine for almost a year. I purchased it because I was under the impression from some comments that Breville's customer service was supposed to be very good. That has REPEATEDLY not been our experience. Every CSR has sounded bored, short and uninterested. No warm customer service here. My machine is under warranty still and as gasket went out. I called, very clearly explained the part I needed and the rude lady charged me for the replacement part. I get it home, and it's the WRONG part! I touched base with them via facebook and through their online customer service form multiple times. They have ignored every single attempt to contact them about this issue. Looking around on facebook, I see I'm not the only one having this experience. The machine is starting to make noises and their customer service isn't interested in honoring their warranty. It was a $600 machine that we have gotten about a year out of. I will never purchase from Breville again. I will be saving my money and going with a company that builds better machines that have a record of lasting 15-20 years.

**********Original Post****************

We have really enjoyed this machine! I am a first time owner and was hesitant about the learning curve. I had whole beans on hand that were a couple months old and I'm awful glad I had them to practice on. My recommendations for newbies and those on the fence about purchasing:

1) Get on YouTube and watch several videos specific to this machine's operation. There are many good ones out there. Also watch general videos on espresso making, latte art, 101s. Most are short and informative, while giving newbies a decent point of reference to start from.

2) When starting out, use cheaper whole beans to get the feel of grinding and tamping. Expect some spillage and some waste. It also gives you an excellent starting point for comparing those fresh roasted beans you'll buy after you get your technique right. ALSO, if you have a good, local coffeehouse, try a shot of their espresso if you've never had a straight shot. It's one thing to have a flavored latte, but it's a whole different animal when you want to know what a good shot should look and taste like first hand. Spent grounds are excellent organic matter for gardens, so definitely pass them along to a gardening friend if you don't have one yourself.

3) Others have said this, Breville recommends it, but it's still worth mentioning. Make a method and stick with it. I started out with Kicking Horse 454 whole beans and also purchased Kroger's Simple Truth organic beans along with Sbx's espresso roast. All off the shelf with no roast date. I started on ground size 6 (where it was when I opened the box) and manually ground, tapped on the counter, ground, tapped, ground, tamped. When that didn't produce the desired pressure, I altered 1 variable. Usually ground size or tamping pressure. The 454 beans produced the correct pressure at ground size 5, while Sbx was a 1 and Kroger's was an 8. The crema varied greatly and you could definitely taste the differences between over and under extracted. Taste those shots, too. I now know what a seriously undesirable shot tastes like, simply because I didn't just chuck it out. Taste, taste, taste. Also, in order to find the right tamping pressure, I filled my portafilter and tamped with what I thought would be enough pressure, noted the results, pulled another shot while tamping with what I thought was too much pressure, noted the results and again with what I thought wasn't enough pressure. I don't have a scale to measure pressure at the moment, but that gave me a good idea of what was too much or not enough.

4) After you've gotten comfortable with the overall process, buy some really good beans! We have a wonderful coffeehouse in our town and I got with the owner about buying some of his beans. He picked up his fresh roasted beans from Austin on Monday and I bought mine on Tuesday. These puppies were practically still off gassing! And let me tell you, the difference was out of this world! The crema was so thick, the shot was the pouring texture of warm honey, the flavors were pronounced, smooth, amazing! I did nothing different in my technique. The results using fresh beans cannot be overstated.

5) The dual-wall filter is a life saving device for up and coming baristas. It is very forgiving and was the reason my very first shot was quite good! :) But, don't let that stop you from trying out that single wall basket. I had never operated an espresso machine, yet 2 days after unboxing it (and 2# of practice beans later) I was using the single wall basket to make lattes and Americanos for (some very honest) guests who were raving about how good they were. One even text me the next day saying she couldn't stop thinking about the vanilla latte she had. It CAN be done!

6) Amazon has a pretty good return policy and though I haven't spoken with Breville's customer service department, from all indications in these reviews, they are excellent to work with. This made me feel confident that if the machine didn't work out, I wouldn't be stuck with a paperweight that I hated.

Aside from all that,the machine is gorgeous. The steaming wand works, but I could definitely use some 1-on-1 training in milk stretching and microfoaming. From others that know about steaming milk, there seems to be some room for improvement, however I have been able to make some cute works of impromptu art by altering whatever foam pattern poured into my cup. (Think cloud watching.) The grinder is the best I've owned or used. Zero complaints.

All in all, it's a great machine that I feel is a wonderful value. It has allowed me to learn something new at a comparatively low price. I feel the warranty is reliable and I would gladly recommend it to anyone that is willing to put a little time into figuring it out."
180,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I couldn't be happier with the Breville BES870XL Expresso machine. My husband and I were Starbuck addicts for years. We finally decided to shift to making our own at home and through much research I came across the Barista. I was amazed at how lengthy and enthusiastic the reviews were so we took the leap of faith, even though it was a bit pricey compared to other machines. However, we have not been disappointed. Not only does it make great lattes, but they are even better than the ones we were getting at Starbucks all these years. Some of the reviews said that it would take awhile to tweak it for a good cup, but our very first cup was excellent. It is a very well designed machine with the built in grinder and steamer. Although the steamer jug provided is sufficient to steam milk for one latte at a time, I did go ahead and invest in a 32 oz steamer jug so that I can froth enough for two lattes at a time. It also seems that using the larger cup with more milk makes for a creamier and lighter latte. We started with the 1 cup filter basket as recommended, but now use the 2 cup basket which is perfect for a venti size latte. The Breville is easy to maintain, clean, replenish water and beans. I absolutely adore this machine and look forward every morning to making our delicious lattes after our daily workouts. We have been using 2% milk to keep calories down, and it is still amazing. If you are a discriminating latte drinker, this machine is for you!!"
181,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I own two of these espresso machines, one for work and for at home, and have put them to good use. As far as getting into espresso at a good price point, I think this machine is in a great position the built in grinder has worked very well, and allowed me to adjust between different coffee sources. One thing that I have noticed is that a visually oilier bean will tend to clog this machine, meaning more flushing in order to clear out the previous bean residue. Aside from that, I have never had any problems finding an optimal grind size and amount that tasted great with this semi-auto. My only real qualm is with the lifetime these machines seem to have. The first machine started having problems after 2 years, and the second has recently started showing its age recently (Just over 3 years). My only recommendation with these is that you need to know the expected lifetime of these. On average I would say each machine put out a latte/americano a day. Without caring much for it, it will probably last you two very active years before it becomes a bit more tricky to get an alright shot out of it. With caring the machine will likely work perfectly for another year on top of that. By care I mean, proper replacement of the water reservoir filter, and care of the group head cleanliness. Now that I am on the other end of that spectrum with both machines, I often find myself with significantly less water flow, and a malfunctioning switch between steam, hot water, and group head that seems to get stuck between steam and group head... essentially making both useless until I talk it into mostly switching back to one or the other. I have not tried reaching out to Breville, but would be surprised if they will be able to do anything for me as I would expect I have gone beyond the expected life of these machines.

With my exquisite sample size of two I seem to have found that the expected optimal lifetime of these machines is ~3 years. I think this is a great machine to learn on and tinker with settings a little bit at home that can introduce you to various espresso drinks at a very reasonable price. Having now owned one (well two really), I will probably not purchase another, but will likely try to find a good deal on a machine designed for a longer lifetime. Then again if a good enough deal doesn't come along, I may find myself saving up for another one of these. In the mean time the two that I currently have still do work, only not to the high caliber they used to. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for their first at home espresso machine."
182,5.0,2022-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I made the decision to purchase this machine after doing some simple math in my head related going to the local coffee shop seven days a week and winter coming....not looking forward to going out to get a cup of espresso that can be ""so-so"" sometimes. I will tell you I reviewed all the video's I could find on this machine. It took me three weeks to pull it out of the box....I am not one to back down from a challenge but this one caused some trepidation. I have been using this machine just shy of six weeks. The biggest thing I love about this is YOU GET TO CHOSE THE BEANS.... I make some of the best coffee drinks around. I can make one cup in about a minute in half. Once you get it down you too will make some of the most amazing drinks. I would strongly recommend trial of all kinds of whole beans. I have found some amazing whole beans. I hope you find this helpful. This machine will pay for itself and your family will turn on the machine for you in the morning. Happy brewing!!!"
183,4.0,2022-07-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Former Saeco Intellia fully automatic espresso maker here and I roast my own beans (Brazilians, I prefer rich, chocolate flavors, no fruit/sour notes). I'm going to run through the differences and strengths/weaknesses of these two.

This machine:
- cheaper (> 50%?) comparing new to new (more below on that)
- more control/power (grind size/amount and has higher pressure)
- ability to easily use pre-ground coffee
- much more work
- much more cleaning
- nice pressure gauge for judging extraction

Fully automatic (Intellia)
- less expressed (weaker espress)
- once dialed in, very repeatable
- no daily cleaning
- complete ease to make as many shots as you like
- Phillips provides complete diagrams and sells individual parts (kept already refurbished machine alive for ~6 years?)
- hard to deal with pre-ground coffee (pour it down this chute, but often jams or doesn't work well)

So if you want good espresso with little mess and push button ease, buy the Intellia and look into refurbished (would recommend SeattleCoffeeGear). Can be 50% off new but essentially new.

If you want more control and love *really* strong espresso and enjoy the process, buy this machine. Also you can then buy pre-ground decaf and have it after dinner!

In particular for this machine, it's very pretty, good pressure, good grinder. Annoyances are the weird 'amount' dial that doesn't seem to work quite right (less doesn't get you much less), especially for double shots (mentioned in other reviews). It's very hard to change the single/double filters. Is there a tool I missed? Really, it's hard to change these filters.

At this point, 2 weeks in, I have not gotten coffee that I enjoy as much as with the Intellia. But it took me some time with that machine as well. The 'default' coffee from this machine is much stronger/expressed that I like, so it's very strong, and honestly, is like what you get from a pro-barista/espresso set up. Setting the grind to coarse, using less coffee and short pull times has given me pretty close to what I like."
184,5.0,2016-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine and use it daily, never had a problem with it and have had it 1 year now, my granddaughters got it for me june 9,2021, it couldn’t be a better present !!! Definitely recommend this one !!!"
185,4.0,2019-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Like if a lot but a week after I received it I saw if for $100 less. Almost returned it but why bother. I requested a price match but got no response.
186,4.0,2020-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been espresso double shot drinker for well over 20 years. Growing up in Europe i actually did not know anything else but espresso. After reading many reviews - good and bad i decided to pull the trigger on Breville BES870xl. Few things i have noticed with this machine- using a Lavazza Super Crema beans i can not make the machine to get into the right extraction zone- i am always bellow with the point. However even so the espresso comes little quick than the manufacturer recommendation it has nice thick crema and strong flavor- does not feel under-extracted at all. I would try use at least two other brands to see if the reason is beans or just inaccurate gauge reading. I never pour milk in my espresso as this ruins the flavor of the coffee completely but the steam seems to produce nice micro bubbles in about 90sec. Fine tuning the temperature control before exctraction - +,-4F in 2F increments is great if changing coffee beans often. ""Auto Purge"" function ensures the ground coffee will not be burnt by the initial water flow from the thermocoil being too hot right after using the steam. That hot water is automatically released into the drip tray after the steaming to ensure optimal temp. for the coffee.
Espresso coming out of that machine is Heaven and takes minimum skills. As this is the newer model of BES860 i was unable to find any information about the well known 860XL problem with water leak which occurs in about a year in most of the reviews that i found. I would love to hear from Breville expert if they take any steps to address that issue. The main competitor in my purchase list was Ranchillio Silva v3, which is proven champion during the years but comes about $500 more expensive- for the new one with installed PID controller $200 and a nice grinder -about $330

UPDATE: 06/11/2013
BES870XL is back at Amazon...Replaced it wit Breville Infuser + Breville Smart Grinder. Build in grinder comes out a complete joke. With new Smart Grinder i have a lot more flexibility and can handle pretty much any beans that i throw in. Thing that you would missed is programable temperature, which is not big deal for me because build in PID plus ne thermocoil deliver consistent results at great temperature.
UPDATE: 06/28/13
Breville Infuser is a good machine but Smart Grinder is not capable of grinding fine enough. On finest setting, my Lavazza Super Crema still comes fast, and even the crema looks ok it taste sour and felt under-extracted. At this point i am don experimenting with different Breville combinations and got Ranchilio Silvia V3 with Auber PID and Ranchilio Rocky grinder. It comes more expensive but considering the 3 years warranty(2 from factory and 1 from retailer) , much better, almost commercial build in quality and a lot more capable Grinder it is justifying the cost. If you are not straight espresso shooter- Breville Infuser+Smart Grinder could be a good solution.
Forget to mention my Smart Grinder start changing the grind setiings on its own after pressing Start button- it goes all the way to the finest setting regardless of what i've set ...so reliability of this brand is highly questionable for me.
Good luck everyone and let the best Espresso machine win ;))))"
187,5.0,2019-07-26, Black Sesame," Great machine for a beginner. I have had this machine for a year now. Like many beginners who purchased their first espresso machine, I had expectations to make beautiful latte arts with it. The first six months, I was frustrated as I couldn’t get it right. I almost gave up and was convinced that this machine cannot make latte arts. However, I was wrong! I kept practicing and getting better. Now I’m able to do decent latte designs. I would recommend getting a good bottomless fortafilter and precision tamper. Always use fresh coffee beans from local roasters. You will be surprised by how consistent you can get with this machine! I would keep using this one for a few more years before I upgrade to a better model"
188,5.0,2022-07-09, Black Sesame,Excelent machine
189,5.0,2022-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"To me, there's a middle ground between great quality and decent price and this machine does that. Granted, its more expensive than most espresso machines but the quality is there every time. I bought my machine in November 2020 and it took me some time to find the perfect grind settings and grind amount (it comes with recommendations, but I found settings that work best for me) but once I did, I don't think I ever have a bad cup. The trick is in the beans you choose. Cheap beans = bad tasting. Decent-great beans = great tasting. I'll add the beans I use at the bottom for those who are interested in a decent price. But I'll talk about a few minor cons.
Cons
1) It takes time to get used to the machine (watch some youtube videos and you'll figure it out)
2) the milk steamer doesn't have a thermometer (I bought my own, burnt milk can also ruin a cup of coffee)
3) The instructions seem to be from a previous model where a couple of changes were made - most notably the tablet cleaning process is a bit different
4) It comes with a lot, but a cleaning towel for the milk steamer would have been great. I can obviously use my own towel that works, but as you'll see some fabric doesn't work so well at cleaning.

Overall, like many things on the expensive side, it takes some time to understand the system, but its great/consistent in the long-run. I don't foresee any mechanical issues in the future, but the product support is there as well!

My beans recommendations: Lavazza Caffe Espresso Italiano Whole Bean Coffee Blend, Medium Roast, 2.2-Pound Bag (Pack of 2)"
190,5.0,2019-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I haven't been as excited about a product in a while, but this espresso machine is a life-changer. You can dial in some AMAZING tasting latte's without being a barista or coffee nerd by a long shot. I was on the fence of this or an automated machine, but I learned that the automated machines must use a pressurized basket, where in real espresso the pressure is generated by the beans and grind and tamp itself. Somehow I understand this to make a difference, and while I haven't compared the two, the quality of whatever is going on with this machine is fantastic. Also don't bother with the Delonghi comparable machine, it also only uses pressurized baskets, and from what I gather is of lesser build quality.
Also the steam wand takes a moment to warm up, but works great as a manual steam wand. Basically making coffee is the highlight of my morning. And maybe after dinner as well for a single shot. And some caramel syrup. Or chai mix. You get the idea, it's great."
191,5.0,2019-11-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"3rd year update!
I STILL love this machine. It has had more brew cycles than I could possibly count and yet it performs like new. I try to follow the cleaning process every 6 months or so and replace the water filter every 4 months or so, that is the only maintenance I do. This thing makes great espresso and it is very easy to use. It was a gift for my wife 3 Christmas's ago but it turned me into a coffee addict and I use it daily now. I noticed the price has come down over the years, I think these were around $600 when I bought ours. Black Rifle Coffee ""Silencer Smooth"" is my preferred bean, that or Kona beans from Hawaii. Definitely consider this machine if you are in the market. I haven't been disappointed.

2 year update!
2 years later and I still love this machine! Absolutely no problems. I just follow the cleaning instructions in the manual every few months when I remember to do it. This is my favorite kitchen appliance I have ever bought. It was a gift for my wife 2 years ago but it turned me into a coffee addict and I use it almost daily. I could not be more impressed.

***Original Review***
I can't speak highly enough about this machine. I was never a huge coffee junkie but since I bought this for my wife for Christmas I am a full-blown addict. I have gone absolutely nuts mixing up different lattes and versions of espresso. It surprises me that using Starbucks coffee beans and the same ingredients, I end up with a much better product than I get at Starbucks. This machine extracts the most wonderful flavor out of the coffee beans we put in it. I love the fact that I can change the grind size and the volume of water for brewing. I haven't bothered to change the brewing temperature but that is also an option.
I know this is a huge jump from the cheap little Mr. coffee espresso machines they sell for less than $100. But trust me, we learned the hard way that those are just absolute junk. My wife had bought one of the cheap ones at target and when I looked at the reviews on Amazon for the same machine, many people had reported that they were exploding. We immediately returned it.
In comparison, this machine has a very heavy duty brewing handle. It feels like an industrial-strength type brewing handle that you'd find in Starbucks or any other coffee shop. You can adjust just about everything on this machine. It would take me too much time to go through all of the features of it so you might just want to watch the video that's attached to this listing. I am so glad I decided to go all out and buy this for my wife."
192,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great product, wonderful espresso. Highly recommend for those who like to tinker with their final product. The new digital ones don’t seem to allow that much customization like this one does."
193,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took a few tries to get the grind settings correct, but once we figured out the best settings it made a great cup of espresso. I recommend reading the review by VR they had so many helpful tips. Reading their review really helped me decide to go with this machine. I also recommend watching a YouTube video of how to froth the milk. Overall I’m very pleased with my purchase!!"
194,5.0,2022-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I LOVE this espresso machine. It is phenomenal, I don't think you'll find another one with this type of performance for under 1k. I've been using this machine approximately daily for a year and a half and it still works just as well as it did on day one. The grind control is fantastic and provides a consistent grind. The temperature and pressure control is great, every espresso I've put through it tastes great (not burned or under extracted). I've used dairy and all kinds of other milks and it steams and froths them all very well. For a single serving of coffee, I find it easier now to make an americano using this machine than any other method. I also love being able to make an affogato at home! The cleaning is straight forward, I do use the Breville cleaning powder/tabs. I generally use a kettle for tea, but the hot water feature is also useful for a quick cup of tea. I really can't recommend this machine enough, it's my favorite and probably most used kitchen appliance.
My only complaints, which I think in no way should deter someone from purchase:
1: For such a beautifully designed, easy to use machine, the floater that indicates that the drip tray is full is almost useless. My husband in particular fails to remember to empty the drip tray and has overflowed it several times since the indicator doesn't actually show in the window when it's full. That said, it's definitely best to regularly empty instead of waiting for it to be full. It can get gunky and the base of the tray is the only piece that's challenging to clean in any way.
2: A latte mug and even some large coffee mugs are too tall to fit under the filter, so you cannot brew directly into a taller mug. Obviously this is only a minor inconvenience, but one to be aware of."
195,5.0,2019-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this for my husband's birthday. He is not just a coffee nut, but he is all about the process. He has done tons of research to learn how to pull a good shot and steam the best milk. (I am grateful I get to enjoy the fruits of his labor!) 😋

He had been wanting this specific machine for awhile, and it has not let us down. It takes a little time to get used to, so don't give up if your first few drinks aren't what you hoped... for us it was user error! Just play around with the grind size and amount; each coffee brand is a little different.

We also follow a Ketogenic diet, and this has enabled us to make some amazing Keto Mochas and Lattes!

Pros: Small footprint, ease of use, all-in-one, comes with all basics for getting started, cafe-quality drinks at home

Cons: Steam wand is a little weak/slow, steam switch tends to stick (hard to turn), grinder can be a little messy, pressure gauge is helpful but can be misleading (go by taste)

No con should dissuade you from buying it, especially at this price point; they are just good to know."
196,5.0,2021-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Comes with a lot of tools and instructions. I love the way my coffee tastes but I didn’t know you needed to change a filter every 2 months and clean the machine as much. I love it but my nespresso is faster and easier but the coffee from this is slightly better. Overall I do like it. Let’s see how long it lasts.
197,5.0,2021-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have had this machine for about a year now. I make 1-2 lattes on the weekdays and 2 each Sat/Sun. I have had absolutely zero issues so far. It performs as it should every day. I read that others were having trouble using oily beans but I have not had that issue. I buy the darkest oiliest beens I can find and they grind fine. I have never had to clean or service the grinder. I do clean the espresso side about every 1-2 months with cleaning tabs. Very easy and quick.
The quality of espresso/latte etc is really mostly limited to the amount of time you are willing to put into learning. Anyone that tells you that all you haver to do is push buttons to get great espresso is oversimplifying things. There is some skill in getting a good espresso pull and a great milk froth, but with this machine it is possible. The internet is full of tips/videos on this and little time learning will be rewarded with great drinks. I regularly make lattes, cappuccinos etc for others and never get a bad review. Every batch ob beans is different and will require changing the grind settings a little. This is normal (your barista does it!) and usually take only a press or two to dial in. I keep a post it above my machine with settings for various beans I buy. This gets me close on the first shot. You will not get quality steamed/frothed milk if you just throw a carafe under the steam wand and walk away. Steaming requires attention. Check out the internet/youtube for tips. Done properly this machine can make any consistency you want.

That said, the machine isn't perfect, but for the price and footprint it is a great value.

Pros:
Great espresso with nice crema
great steamed/frothed milk with a little practice
Quick warmup time
Reliable
Easy to clean
Cup warming deck on the top
Hopper holds enough beans for several days-1 week of drinks for 1-2 people
grind is consistent and puts out a pretty consistent amount
Makes drinks that are very close to the quality of a multi thousand dollar machine
Overall quality is high. Machine is solid and well built...and heavy!

Cons: Not many given the price
Does not have a connection to hook up to permanent water supply, Must refill the water reservoir manually.
Steam output is a little low. It's normal for a machine of this size/price but does require 1-2 minutes to properly steam milk vs. 20-30 sec. on an industrial machine.

I'll update this review if things change, but for now I consider this an excellent buy and well worth the investment. Considering an espresso drink costs $3-6 at the local espresso bar, this machine has paid for itself several times over."
198,5.0,2021-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Read the review by VR. They are 100% correct on the accessories you should buy. I've had this machine for quite a while now and I've put more shots through it than I can count. It's easy to use and clean. You can start out with the pressurized dual wall baskets and get a decent espresso. There is a noticeable difference in flavor when using single wall vs dual wall baskets. I highly suggest you perfect your barista skills. After some trial and error I was able to get the perfect ratio with 18.5g beans to get it in the optimum pressure range at about 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock position on the gauge. The grinder works great and gets pretty fine grounds. The tamper works great and you don't really need a leveler since the machine cones with ""the razor"" for leveling. I didn't have any need for another grinder. However I have roommates and didn't want the trouble of swapping out beans, and was interested in some of the hand grinders. I got the 1zpresso JE-Plus Manual Coffee Grinder and it pairs really well with this machine. Watch some YouTube videos on grind and tamping and you'll be a pro. I highly suggest the Breville videos by Hoon's coffee and Seattle coffee gear. Have fun!"
199,4.0,2021-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The life span of this machine appears to be +/- 7 years. We use ours daily for 2-4 double shots per day. Our old machine lost the power to get the ""press"" into the espresso range, meaning that the flavor became very poor. We liked it well enough, and it seems very well built, so we decided to get it ""serviced"", whatever that might mean. Nope, Not in the US. No service centers, and the people we talked to in the Seattle area said Breville won't respond to requests for parts in order to do repairs. Obviously unacceptable for a (then) $600 machine.

So off I went on the search. I looked all over the mid-priced spectrum. We like espresso, and a machine in this price range amortizes for us in easily less than two years. But we weren't willing to spend 4k for a next level machine. The verdict is unanimous - this is the best machine in this price range, and no one else is even close. So we spent the $700. The new machine is on the counter and works great, and the old machine is in the box hoping, I suppose, that this Australian company changes it's support for repairs."
200,5.0,2021-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If your machine just can't get into the espresso pressure range, it could be that the beans are too stale. Try the double walled filter, or use fresh baked beans. I just learnt this from the great Breville support and that solved my problem!"
201,5.0,2020-08-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love our espresso machine. No issues. Cleaning is a breeze. We have tried several different roasts and we love them all! Would definitely buy again!
202,5.0,2017-11-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There's tons of reviews here with lots of details and photos, so I won't go too in depth.

This machine is PERFECT. For backstory- I was a Barista for a while and already know how to perfectly pull an espresso and steam milk. If you don't, it will take a little learning and a thermometer!

I did NOT want to have to buy Nespresso refills due to the cost and waste, when I have a coffeeshop in town that roasts their own espresso I can get at a great price in a reusable container. This allows me to really personalize my drink at a lower cost, so the more expensive machine is worth it!

It DID take a 10oz bag of beans to really dial it in, but once I did... I can make the BEST Americano, Latte or Cappuccino I've EVER HAD. All my friends are Baristas and coffee 'snobs,' and they agree. I leave it on the settings for whole bean grind, double shot. It pours the thickest crema and tastes amazing.

TIPS:
Get a milk brother cleaning concentrate!!!! Hot water is NEVER enough to really clean the milk wand, and if you get build up it's impossible to clean it off.
For quickness and ease, choose a setting that works for you and leave it there. A single shot would never be used in my house, and we would never buy pre-ground since this grinder is so damn easy. A double shot will make our ideal drink, no matter what kind.
If you can't tell milk temp by hand yet, use a thermometer to figure out what you like best.
Keep the water tank full and replace filters when it says! Also, using filtered water will extend the life of your filters. If all the sudden your machine is sucking... you probably just forgot to fill it. The tank pops off super easily.
Keep it clean- ALWAYS! Once again, build up of grounds and gross water in the bottom is gross and it's so so easy to dump and rinse. Clean the milk frother daily. I usually only use it once per week, so it's simply to steam water with the cleaning agent and wipe the wand off.

Purchase and enjoy amazing home drinks!!"
203,5.0,2014-05-09, Black Sesame,"I have had this machine for over 5 years. I was a barista in college and always wanted my own machine. It's not as powerful as a professional machine, but it gets the job done. The steaming wand and grinder work great. I have never had an issue with it. As long as you take care of it, and clean it regularly its definitely worth the investment."
204,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,
205,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Tl;Dr- this is a great machine if you are willing to care for it.

I adore my Barista Express. I've had the unit for about 2 months now, and I've had wonderful luck with it. I will say, this is not a ""one and done"" type of purchase. If you are not invested in learning how to make proper espresso, I can see how this machine would become frustrating quickly. You MUST experiment with the grind settings and tamp to ensure the system is generating enough pressure to properly extract the espresso. The gauge on the front is quite useful for this, and the included guide offers great beginners tips. It could take quite a while to find settings that work for your machine and the beans you are using; I spent a few hours the first day I got it fine tuning my settings for the perfect espresso.
As others have stated, the frothing/steaming the milk takes some practice as well. Lots of excellent YouTube videos to assist in this endeavor!
One thing I have to mention: you NEED to be serious about cleaning and maintaining this machine. Like any espresso machine, there are a lot of critical components that can become dirty and damaged very easily. Personally, I always run a ""single cup"" shot through an empty portafilter before and AFTER I've made my espresso, every single time. I clean the grinder in between each filling as well, and so far have gone through one cycle with the cleaning tablets, they seemed to work well. I use only filtered water in my machine, but will probably descale soon anyway just to keep it running well.
Overall I'm very pleased with this machine, though I will update my review if any negatives come up!"
206,5.0,2022-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was just a simple coffee drinker with your basic Kuerig until I decided I wanted this awesome device during the covid lockdown. I use it to make mostly cappuccinos for me and the entire family. It is so much better than what I used to drink and the process is fun once you get the hang of it. I also found that I no longer even want to add sugar since it is sooo smooth and delicious.

I've found the following helpful...

- Get high-quality coffee. This is usually local and fresh. I use INTELLIGENTSIA BLACK CAT and love it. If you don't, the system won't develop correct pressures. Calling support really helped me to understand this issue.
- Practice steaming milk until you get it right. Youtube videos helped me sort this out.
- Get some microfiber towels and keep them handy to clean the steamer and counter. I hang them to dry and use one all week.
- Get a coffee tamper and funnel to help lessen the mess and make this part easier
- Put a folded paper towel under the grinder and also on the counter to lessen the mess, avoid clogged drains and save coffee.

The paper towel, I think, is very important since it helps you avoid dropping ground coffee into the collection tray which then inevitably goes down your drain. I have a septic system so potential clogs in the system worried me a lot. Also, with the funnel, it makes it easy to rescue spilled coffee after grinding.

207,5.0,2020-04-13, Black Sesame,"This is an incredible little coffee machine! I run a small cafe and have used it daily for over a year now. I get perfect espresso shots every time.

The only issue I've had (I suspect this is from heavy use) is the silicone steam ring cracked so I had to replace it.

Tips:
⚪ Invest in good coffee beans - this is KEY!
⚪ Adjust your machine to your beans. This takes trial and error. I found adjusting the top burr also helped to get the perfect pressure
⚪ Always wait at least 10 minutes for your machine to heat up before pulling a shot
⚪ Keep up with the maintenance on the machine. Clean it regularly, including the grinder, change the filter
⚪ Check out youtube for tips on getting the right pressure, steaming milk and latte art
⚪ If you're having no luck and your coffee is tasting bad it is likely your beans. Make sure they're fresh, organic and good quality!"
208,5.0,2022-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU THINK THIS WILL MAKE YOU A PREMIUM AMERICAN STYLE COFFEE!

This machine is GREAT for making your favorite espresso based drinks, but it will NOT brew a traditional style American coffee no matter how hard you try. The closest you can get is an americano which is NOT the same.

For everything else, it is very premium in quality all the way down to the extra storage tray that is stuffed in the back behind the drip tray. It is detachable from the drip tray and you get it out by interesting the drip tray to ""grab"" it and then pull out to get it out. great design.

Plan to waste a full back of coffee beans on this thing while you try to figure out grind size, amount to get the right tasting espresso shot. I gave this thing 3 out of 5 stars for cleaning because it is a mess and comes with a science kit for when it is time to clean."
209,5.0,2015-08-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this Breville Barista Express just over a year ago and I absolutely love it! I have never been an espresso, latte, cappuccino drinker, but now I won't drink anything else. I switched from a good 'ole drip coffee maker to this machine and it was worth every penny. I use it every day, and the drink is so good one is usually my max (so really it helped me cut down on coffee!). I was worried about keeping it clean when I bought it due to all the reviews and online videos, however, I bought this tamp mat which is the perfect size to fit on top of the drip tray, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YDCC5MF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
and these microfiber towels which fold in half to make the same size as the tamp mat https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OVN6QPU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Both allow me to keep grounds from getting into the drip tray any overspray from getting all over and easy wipe down of the steam arm and the machine. I created my own version of what I call an Americuccino (An Americano with water from the hot water spout and cream steamed together) and it is the best cup of ""coffee.""

The machine hasn't given me any problems, the cleaning light comes on to remind you to clean it out; I descale it and change the water filter at the same time, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PSJ7F8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

to clean out the grinder and that seems to have helped as well.

There is a reason it is the #1 first time at home espresso machine. I wouldn't buy anything but this one!"
210,4.0,2021-10-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,We had this since December 2021 and it’s okay. We use it daily and generally don’t have many issues. We like to try new beans but finding it’s grind level is a pain sometimes. Only had one issues were a bean got stuck and I had to take apart the top to clear it out. Not worth $700 but it’s not junk.
211,5.0,2020-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife and I were spending about $20 a week minimum on lattes at the local coffee shops. After doing some research we decided to pull the trigger on this when it was on sale. We couldn't be happier!

This machine is the perfect ""beginner"" in-home espresso machine. It has everything you need to brew real espresso and espresso drinks at a good price point.

We use this at least 4 times a week, sometimes more. We figure we have been saving $20 a week for the past 10 weeks, essentially the machine will pay for itself in another 10 weeks.

PROS
+ Easy to setup
+ Includes everything you need (except a $9 beverage thermometer for frothing milk)
+ High quality materials
+ Built in grinder, with varying grinder size
+ Easy to maintain (tells you when to clean and descale)

CONS
+ Takes a little bit of practice to get the right amount of packing pressure down
+ The steamer takes a few seconds to ""warm up"" before you can froth the milk

Other things:
- some people complain about the size of the stainless steel milk pitcher - it works fine for me
- some people complain about the fact that you have to refill the water tank - my wife and I use this 4 times a week minimum and we don't mind the extra few minutes it requires to refill once a week

Some recommendations:
- find a local roaster and get beans from them. we used store bought Peets and Starbucks whole beans, but they seem to be coated with a light oil or polish to preserve freshness. local beans give us a better tasting end product
- watch some youtube videos to show you how to froth the milk if you haven't done this before, they give great tips using this exact machine
- put a small towel down on the surface where you make the coffee - the stainless steel grate is a bit prone to scratching

Overall we couldn't be happier. This allows us to brew real espresso drinks in a few minutes from the comfort of our home."
212,5.0,2019-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine has paid for itself over the last 2 years. I've had a blast trying out different espresso beans from my area. To me, there is one thing that sets this machine apart from the others. The PRESSURE GAUGE is the key. The gauge enables you to quickly ""dial in"" your beans without using a scale or having to do calculations. It is worth its weight in gold. Cleaning has been easy and there have been no mechanical problems. I ordered the tamper leveler from crema coffee products and it simplifies the leveling and tamping but is not required. (53mm Coffee Distributor/Leveler & Tamper, Fits 54mm Breville Portafilter, Double Sided, Adjustable Depth). One of the best things about the Breville is that everything you need to get going is included. Sure you can add a few things as you go, but you are good to go right out of the box. Third Coast Coffee in Austin ships me their Organic Pacifico Espresso beans at 1pd for $9! I ship it by UPS to my area for $8. The beans have usually been roasted within the last 2 or 3 days. It's a great deal on a good medium espresso blend. The Pacific Foods Oat Milk has been the milk of choice in my home. It blends well with espresso and has just a bit of sugar added. For mochas and vanilla lattes I use the Sweetleaf Organic Stevia drops. There are plenty of videos out there to help you get going. Hope you have as much fun as I have!"
213,5.0,2022-06-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love the Breville Barista Express. We make 4 or 5 double shot lattes every day. We have been doing that since we got it in Nov 2018. The machine still looks and performs like new over 2 years later. It also lets you know when to clean or descale it. I don’t have to try to remember the maintenance. This will make it last a long time.

There is a bit of a learning curve to get the grind size and volume set right, but once that is done, there is no need to mess with it unless you change coffee beans.

The steamer does a great job, too. That also takes a bit of practice. But I can now make latte art like hearts and rosettas.

We love this thing so much that, if we leave on a long trip and we are driving, we take it with us! We have set it up in several hotel rooms and all our family comes to our room in the morning for coffee instead of going to Starbucks.

I did get a few accessories. These include a Knock-box to dump the used grounds, a small rubber bar mat to catch excess grounds and provide a soft surface to press the grounds, some clear double-wall glasses so you can see the coffee, and a bunch of cloths to catch water from the steamer wand and to clean the wand.

Bottom line, this is an excellent purchase. It is worth every penny. I highly recommend it and would buy it again."
214,5.0,2020-05-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The phrase, “It will pay for itself!” is often over used. Not in this case if you have a Starbucks habit you’re trying to break. I did the math: a conservative estimate, I was spending $50 a week at Starbucks. So in 14 weeks I’d break even. (Yeah yeah yeah I had my own material costs but don’t worry about that.) And honest truth: Haven’t been back so I’m truly saving money now. The machine is great. It doesn’t make drinks that are “as good as” Starbucks etc - but better. I’ve been on the road and gotten the ol’ faithful at a drive thru and thought “This sucks. I want to go home.” You want a double? A quad? More milk/less foam? Smoother grind/Courser grind? Knock yourself out and you’ll dial in heaven in a cup 100% of the time. While you’re on Amazon, order a yeti coffee cup or rambler and get a recurring order for some beans. Downsides: if you want convenience or speed, then a pod-based version may be better. There are still several steps in this process. Water and steam heat up adequately fast, grinding takes a few seconds, and I can make two quad lattes in maybe 5 minutes. There may be a faster version that presses the grounds and steams at the same time, but this model does just one at a time. And it seems smaller, more compact than I was thinking. Quiet? Yeah, nah. The steam can hit a piercing shrill if it hits the aluminum cup just right. And it’s messy. Maybe I’m a slob (probably), but there’s a drip tray full of water every time, grounds in the sink, and grounds on the counter.

TL;DR You won’t go back to Starbucks. It’s messy, but worth it."
215,5.0,2015-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I decided to upgrade from a $100 machine I had used sporadically for over ten years. After a lot of research I decided on the Breville as offering the best value. Note that I didn't want a fully automatic machine. I wanted to learn how to craft my own espresso.

I love the machine. I make 2-3 cafe americano and 1-2 lattes each day.
You should expect that it'll take a few uses to pull the espresso the way you prefer. The variables include the coffee beans, grind texture and quantity, and tamping pressure applied to the coffee in the portfilter.

Pros:
Instruction manual
pressure gauge
single and dual cup options for grind and brew quantity
adjustable grind quantity and fineness
Steamer quickly makes velvety steamed milk
integrated grinder, love that I don't need a separate machine
magnetic storage area for the tamper
The water and coffee grounds tray is very easy to clean
water reservoir is very easy to remove and replace (see note below)

Cons:

The machine height. I thought I had measured it carefully so it would fit under my cabinet. I think the given product dimensions are incorrect, or didn't include the grinder. The machine was about 1/2"" too tall to fit under the cabinet. So, be sure you have a suitable place for it. Even if it had fit under the counter, I see now that I wouldn't have kept the machine there because I need vertical room to remove and replace the water reservoir from the rear of the machine. If you use daily, you'll not want to pull the machine out every time to refill the reservoir."
216,4.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"I don’t know how I feel about this machine. I finally found a setting that I believe produces quality espresso shots, but who the heck knows at this point. It’s a frustrating and, to me, tedious process. Definitely not going to be perfect right out of the box, so prepare yourself.

I also don’t know if it’s normal for so much water to accumulate in the drip tray, and it even seeps below the drip tray. Make sure you empty it after each use to avoid a mess.

But the good part is it’s easy to use on the human side once you get it Calibrated, and it’s a beautiful machine that will make anyone’s kitchen appear that much more sophisticated. Now that it’s rigged up and ready to go, I enjoy americanos every morning. And the occasional latte.

The steam wand does not detach for more deep cleaning, so I’d advise you to have a wet cloth ready to wipe it down after use to prevent milk buildup.

I love it so much now, but I think for the price it shouldn’t be so difficult to get it up and running. This is the first espresso machine I’ve ever purchased though, so maybe I just need to adjust my expectations.

***Updated 3/4/2021*** I switched my beans and that made all the difference. I didn't have to adjust the grind at all, it pulls espresso shots without issue now and I love this machine! Still not a fan of not being able to clean the steam wand well, and all the excess water."
217,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this to see what the hype is all about. Drank regular drip coffee from Mr Coffee for years and wanted something different, challenging i guess. Read reviews and saw them mention ""Starbucks taste quality"" or better. thought I would return this after I tried but has been using it now everyday and practicing espresso art 🎨. Picture is after 2 mo practicing lol. Overall great that I dived into this blindly and end up loving it. mind you without any espresso making experience. Now it's my go to coffee erryday. u won't go back to drip coffee after this. ok now gtg back to latte art lesson #12345."
218,5.0,2021-05-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine. I purchased this for $500 in Fall 2019 and use it every day for home espresso. (Not sure why price went up??) The only thing that annoys me is the tamper is too small for the portafilter. No idea WHY. But oh well. So I have to go around and smoosh the sides down and tamp a few times. I'll eventually invest in another tamper, bc this works ok for now.

Milk frother works well. I feel like it takes longer than it should, but I don't use that feature that much to care.

In my experience, if you purchase this machine, also purchase:
*At least 1 double-walled, double shot espresso glass. That's all I've needed out of all the espresso glasses I bought. I also have a small mason jar that has worked fine. Do whatever you need to do. Really anything will work, so long as it's not too TALL.

I also purchased some small, grey hand towels, (mentioned in the top review), to keep on hand for wiping the machine down and to use as a tamp pad.

I purchased a knock box, but I've found that it's not really necessary at home, and is a breeding ground for mold if you don't dump it every other day. I thought, why didn't I just use a bowl to knock the puck out, then dump in the trash? Oh well!

That's about it. Machine is super easy to use, to clean and to pull shots - once you know what you're doing. Figuring it all out only took me about a week.

Highly recommend to anyone looking to up their home espresso game."
219,5.0,2018-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My Rancillio finally bit the dust after 10 years. I researched espresso machines extensively before going for the Breville. I wasn't sure about the combined grinder because that is one of the most important aspects of pulling good shots--a good grinder. And I already have a good stand alone grinder. I almost bought the one without the grinder, but I thought I could save counter space if I paid a little more and got the grinder. I'm glad I did. This machine grinds well. I wait until just a few grains fall over the top, then use the tamper (that attaches by magnet to the inside top of the machine-great because I constantly lost my other tamper after rinsing it), then use the razor that comes with it before connecting the piece to the machine. The grinding, tamping, razoring process takes about 40 seconds. After connection, I just push the double button and I have two perfect shots in 33 seconds. I like lattes so I pour about an inch of whole milk in the stainless steel pitcher that comes with the unit, and turn on the frother. It takes about 78 seconds to froth the milk for a latte or cappuccino. I wipe the frother with a damp rag I leave on top of the machine. So in under two minutes, I have a fabulous latte. The first time you turn on the machine, it heats up in under a minute. If the machine has just gone to sleep, it heats up in about 15 seconds. This is much more time efficient than waiting in line at the coffee store, and it saves a lot of money, now that the Denver coffee shops are charging nearly $5, before tip, for lattes and cappuccinos. I drink 3 or 4 lattes a day. I figure once you include the cost of your time, gas, and the cost of the actual drink, this machine will pay for itself in about a year, less if you drink more and your time is worth a lot."

221,5.0,2019-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've wanted this machine for a long time. Ever since I really got into Coffee. It took me a second to figure it all out. But, once you use some brain power it's super easy to get the hang of. The Grinder, works better then I expected. For a ""all in one"" expresso machine. I was expecting the Grinder to work decently but it is better then I originally interpreted. Works great with literally every type of blend coffee. Everything else works as listed and great. The Steamer may be a little finicky, but besides that. It gets the job done."
222,4.0,2022-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Unit 1 review:

I’ve pulled about 60 shots since getting this. Of those, only 2 have ever had the pressure reach “espresso range”. They were delicious. Every other time the espresso has been drinkable but thin. I am tamping the coffee as hard as I can, using the right amount, and have the grind set all the way to “1” (fine). So I don’t know what else to try.

The grinder is quite messy; ground coffee piles up in the back of the basket instead of the middle so there’s almost always some spillage.

I bought this to replace a Gaggia Brera; I am keeping it because the Brera made thin coffee at its best and malfunctioned about 30-40% of the time so this is still an improvement. But it’s still a disappointment.

Unit 2 review: after writing the above review I decided to order a second one to compare. Had no issues with this one; it got to espresso range on the very first shot, and all subsequent ones so far. The first unit also ground way too much and I had to dial the grind amount all the way down; the new one is grinding the correct amount on the factory setting. Lastly, the first one dumped ground beans to the rear and always spilled and created a mess; the new one dors not - no mess! So I believe the first one was a real lemon. If you find you can’t get shots up to pressure, it’s probably not you! Get a replacement. Updating to 5 stars now.

3rd update: after about 10 days the behavior changed. I was consistently getting pressure in the middle of the “espresso range” at first, but for the past few days it has dropped. It’s now still consistent but just reaching the lower limit of the espresso range. Still better than first unit, but disappointing. Adjusting down to 4 stars."
223,5.0,2022-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought our machine 7 1/2 years ago, and it just recently began having hiccups.

We are going to buy the same one new because we love it."

So much so, I decided to graduate to something a little more ""pro"" and wanted to eliminate the bean grinder from the counter top. The Barista was more than I wanted to spend, so I got a reconditioned model and from general appearance, it's ""as new."" No - it's not a $3,500 Italian machine - but it looks great & has a relatively small footprint. I'm reading a lot of reviews concerning machine failures, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I avoid that for awhile. But the fact of the matter is, I couldn't find any espresso machine in this price range that gets 5 stars across the board & doesn't have any reports of reliability issues.
I really like the integrated bean grinder. Frees up counter space & it's design allows for easily changing bean selection. The Barista is definitely more complicated than the Cafe Roma in producing a perfect shot every time. I'm finding that every different bean has a unique characteristic as far as how easily water flows through it, how much you need to load in the portafilter, how hard to tamp it down, etc. I went through a LOT of beans experimenting with the single & dual wall filter baskets. I'm not a purist, so I settled on the dual wall for idiot-proof brewing. Haven't even thought about fiddling with grind size to match certain beans yet.
Some folks said that the shots weren't hot enough, and if you brew right after turning the unit on, the shots are indeed between lukewarm and hot. However - if the machine is on for about 15 minutes, the water seems to warm up to more of a ""hot"" level. I've also read that true Italian espresso shots aren't supposed to be ""hot,"" but it's nice to have the option.
A couple of other things: I wish the unit had a low water indicator light in the front and some sort of ""kill switch"" to turn off the brew cycle. If you run out of water or overfill the portafilter, the machine continues to try to complete the cycle. In the latter case, I don't want the machine to be stuck with the pressure gauge in the red with no way of stopping it. If such a function exists and I don't know about it, I'm all ears.
Bottom line - whether you produce the 'perfect shot' or not, the Barista makes terrific espresso and I'm enjoying the ritual that comes with a more sophisticated machine - even if you have to do a lot of trial and error to reliably figure it out. Fingers crossed it lasts at least as long as the Cafe Roma."
225,5.0,2022-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is worth every penny. I am a coffee lover and have been debating purchasing this machine for a while to replace my Delonghi, which I had for over 10 years. The built in grinder and auto dosing feature is incredibly useful. The large water tank and assorted tools makes this machine very versatile. The pressure gauge and fine tuning on the grinder allows for precision brewing. The customizable dosing and temperature control really allows you to dial in each new coffee. This machine is fantastic and I cannot recommend it enough."
226,5.0,2022-07-18, Brushed Stainless Steel," I had a different espresso machine for 20 years. Getting a good double shot of espresso was a bit of magic. This machine let me dial everything in so it's perfect every time. It seems expensive to buy but it's as much an investment as anything. If you stop by an espresso stand everyday on your way to work it's more than paid for in a year. For me the deciding factor was time. I hate waiting in line. It takes me under 5 minutes to make a mocha. That's less time than I spend sitting in line at the coffee shop. Let alone driving out of my way to go past one. And I get it exactly the way I want it every time. I get to purchase organic coffee from small producers I want to support. I use cacao powder instead of industrial chocolate syrup. On the weekends I enjoy coffee with friends on my patio. I am a fan of Breville. I have their convection oven that I love. Don't get caught up on the price, it's the value that's important. If you buy a cheap one, your total cost will be higher when you end up replacing it with a good one. The only thing you'll have to show for it is years of drinking crappy coffee."
227,3.0,2021-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works best if you are only pouring a single shot. Doubles never quite hit the extraction point no matter the type of grind. Even used a scale to weigh the beans first. If you want a double shot you’ll have to make two singles and then the coffee will get cold it’s a real bummer.
228,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The only reason this gets 3 stars is that we like the espresso flavor. This machine is poorly designed and the mess is insane.

1) When grinding the coffee into the filter basket, it needs to be a heaping mount to tamp it into a shot. Grinds spill all over the machine. I would recommend purchasing a dosing funnel for about $20
- 54mm Dosing Funnel for Breville Barista Portafilters. It saves a ton of grief.

2) the conical grinder at the top is poorly designed. after grinding one dose, you need to hit it at the top as the beans don't settle down to the bottom, resulting in an incomplete grind and fill of the filter

3) the water reservoir is at the back of the machine. To fill it you must remove it from the machine. This means every time you fill it you have to pull the machine away from the wall. The slot at the top of the reservoir is narrow. unless you are extremely careful in filling it you will get water all over the outside.

4) when the bottom tray fills up, it will tell you to empty it. It is narrow and wide, which adds a challenge to carry to sink to empty."
229,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,We’re very happy with this espresso machine. Works great!
230,4.0,2022-01-12, Black Sesame,This item is great. The customer service I received was great!! The steam is ok however it is difficult to turn. Definitely not for elderly or those with arthritis in their hands.
231,5.0,2016-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update: Checking in at 3.5 years. This thing is still going strong, supplying my wife and I with delicious daily lattes. That's roughly 2500 quad lattes without breaking down! The gasket around the group head did pop out recently during one of the cleaning cycles, but didn't need replacement -- we were able to detatch and put it back together. The price has gone up 30% but it's still a steal. Back-of-napkin math:
1 cup milk per drink
20 grams of ground beans per drink
1/2 gal of milk costs $3.50 in my HCOL area
1.14kg of espresso beans is $15
That means each drink is 40 cents of milk and 26 cents of coffee beans. Maybe 10 cents of electricity? Another 4 cents of occasional vanilla or caramel flavoring? Our 2500 drinks have cost $2,000 plus the $500 for the machine, vs $12,500 if we'd walked to the nearby cafe every day. What a bargain!

We've had this now for 1.5 years. It is absolutely the best $500 I've spent in recent memory. It makes a fantastic espresso shot for us plebs. I'm sure true aficionados can find many faults, but for the Starbuck-going average Joe this will make an espresso on par or better simply because you can choose the beans. No plastic waste or expensive custom cups, and you can actually control all the little variables like grind and time and pack density. I get up 10 minutes earlier and prep our morning coffee, saving the $10/day Sbuck habit for two. I haven't done the math, but the cost of milk, beans, and electricity is probably less than half that. 100 days and it pays for itself, 450 days and we're $2200 richer than the alternative."
232,5.0,2022-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I can't gush hard enough over how much I love this machine. It's just such a fantastic espresso maker. There's some learning curve to becoming your own barista, but to me that is part of the fun and enjoyment of making your own espresso drinks at home. This machine is fantastic. Once you have the settings dialed in the way you want them, it becomes a really straight forward and quick process to making the espresso drinks you love best.

Every day, I turn it on to warm up the machine. If I want to be quicker, I'll use the hot water dispenser to warm my cup instead of placing it on top. I make sure the right basket is in the portafilter, set the grind dispenser for that size basket, and let it do it's grind and fill thing... Using the tamper I give a good, even tamp and at this point don't even need to use the razor. I set the portafilter in place then steam my milk. Once the milk is the right temp and texture for me, I punch the size pull I want and out comes that beautiful espresso. Then I get to make my attempt at latte art (still working on this!!) and no matter how it looks, it tastes amazing!!!

Definitely worth the money if you like a real espresso beverage, want to be your own barista, and have control over things vs. spending more money for a fully automated, but inferior (imo) quality, cup of joe.

This might be an entry level machine, but it's likely all I'll ever want or need. I love it!!"
233,5.0,2022-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this machine for 4.5 years now. For sure I've made over a thousand cups and all I can say I don't need sugar in my cappuccino. Of course the coffee bean is extremely important as well as the grind setting. To be honest, I find Starbucks medium roast to be the best. It even tastes better than having Starbucks make it! Just set it to level 1 (finest grind), and pack the double shot real tight. Make sure you're using filtered water, very important. I like strong coffee, so I fill the sup 1/3 of the way and 2/3 frothed milk. I work from home and this machine has paid for itself in delicious cappuccinos 10x over. Don't bother with the automatic machines, they never come out right. You need to do it manually. Hands down, when used properly this machine produces an amazing rich cup of coffee! You won't be disappointed!"
234,5.0,2020-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,There are a few adjustments and a learning curve. Getting the right amount of grind takes few tries. They tell you to use non oily beans which seem to be less then easy to find. I just ordered some Lavazza beans . We will see!
235,5.0,2021-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is an awesome machine! I thought I was buying it for myself because my husband doesn't like lattes...or I should say ""didnt"". With working from home because of COVID, I've been surprising him in the afternoon with a latte and he loves them!! He makes us Americanos every morning. It was so great to get rid of my Kurig and all those plastic kcups!!! My 95 year old dad says...man that's good coffee every time I bring him a cup! It is really a consistently great machine. My only problem is that I now know what a good latte should be and know when the baristia at Starbucks is cutting corners and ripping me off. I even took my machine to a women's weekend and set up a coffee shop for 75 people. It kept up just fine! Great gift! Easy to learn from YouTube videos. Great addition to our home!!"
236,5.0,2022-05-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes great coffee, well thought out design. Makes excellent tasting coffee. I love cappuccinos and this machine makes them well. Takes a bit of counter space, that said everything is here in one spot. Grinder, steamer, hot water, cup warmer and filter basket. Controls are easy to use and after experimenting a couple of times I am turning out great coffee. Makes a great tasting expresso too!"
237,5.0,2017-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Can’t get a better iced shaken espresso than the one I make myself using this espresso machine. It’s a beauty, easy to use, easy to clean, & pulls consistent shots."
238,4.0,2021-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was ready to chuck this thing back to the seller. But we are now on speaking terms. However, I think Breville owes me at least 2-3 bags of quality coffee beans.

Perhaps its that we live in Miami and drink what we call ""Cuban Coffee"" made on larger, expensive, espresso machines at our local Cafeteria Windows but this Breville took some practice to get the machine to reach a desirable pressure to press the coffee properly for our taste.

Having said the above I set off to Youtube for answers. This is what I did even though I should not have had to according to the ""Experts"" which shall remain nameless.

I set the the grinder to the lowest (fine) setting along with adjusting the burr inside the grinder to NO. 3 from 6 (factory setting - google this , it will be very useful and save you lots of time, frustration and perfectly good coffee beans. They say this should only be done after the machine is older, haaaa haaaa.)

Learn how to properly pack the coffee, this combined with the grind solved my problem. The pressure needle now hits right about the middle gray mark every time, perfect crema, strong as all heck coffee and perfect with my Almond or Oat milk, nice and frothy.

The fother works very well, takes a little practice but does a pro job."
239,5.0,2021-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have owned this espresso machine (or a variant of this model) for three years now. I use it almost every day. I have had no problems with it, especially over time.

When I first got it, I had some complaints about the pressure gauge and almost returned it, but after calling support and fiddling with it some more, I realized the variations in pressure had to do not just with how hard I compressed the coffee, but also with the beans I was using and the grind. I suspect there's a way (such as if you run the machine dry) to get air in the gauge system, and running it at high pressure (fine grind well-packed) will re-prime it. Maybe. I can't say for sure.

But that's literally the only problem I've had, an initially wonky gauge. And to be honest, the gauge is more for fun than anything. If you look at the coffee that's dispensed, you can tell what's going on. If it's barely dripping out, pressure is too high. If it's running fast, you might not be getting as much crema as you could.

Steam wand works fine, it can be noisy if you don't pay attention to how deep it is in the milk. The machine is easy to clean.

Most importantly, it just works. Considering the frequency of my use, I think it is durable. I also worked in an office where we had about 10 people regularly using one of these a few times a day. Some of them probably abused it. It started to have pumping problems after over a year, which is actually pretty good considering the accelerated wear of office use. Eventually it got sent back and was good as new.

I have never had leaks or an overflow condition. Now, one time I thought I did, but it turned out I had bad aim when I tried to refill the reservoir while it was on the machine, and dumped some water behind the reservoir. I popped the machine open looking for a leak and it was obvious what happened. But if you weren't the sort to open an espresso machine that is out of warranty, you would see water coming out of the joints in the plastic shell and think it was leaking. So consider that possibility when people complain of leaks."
240,3.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Had mine only a year, stopped working after a few months, they sent a replacement. 2nd time it stopped working they repaired it for free and I only had to do without it for 2 weeks. 3rd time it stopped working and the water flooded my countertops they replaced the replacement. The phone customer service people really were kind and efficient about resolving the problem and they should be commended. Now, if only the product would stop malfunctioning…4th time lucky?"
241,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The positive reviews have it right: This machine produces great espresso shots with rich crema and deep flavors. The steam wand works well and lets you micro-texture milk. I am getting beautiful cappuccinos and flat whites. The machine is a bit needy in how often it wants you to clean and descale it, and it seems to fill the waste water tray rather quickly. However, none of that is a deal-breaker or reason to deduct a star. I also understand that given the combination of high heat and pressure, gaskets will give at some point. The brew gasket blew after three years, but that's an easy (and cheap) fix.

Now, after almost exactly four years (just days after the extended warranty expired) the machine died. When I plug it in, all buttons are dimly illuminated (not the typical blinking of the power button, etc.) but none of them are responsive. No espresso, no grinding, no hot water or steam. I called Breville, and here are my (limited) options: I can try to replace certain parts myself, but that's time-consuming and might not even lead to the desired result. Breville offered to repair/refurbish the machine for $300 (picked up and shipped both ways). But that's more than half of what I paid. They also offer a significant discount for any of their machines that cost less than $1,000--still a hefty investment.

So, why do I say all this? After you have read the glowing reviews that are often written within the first weeks, consider how long the machine might last before it needs repair. When I asked, the Breville rep guessed that in average 4 years is the time until repairs are necessary. I do not think that there are any quality control issues or cut corners in the productions. And I believe that it would be much more expensive to build an espresso machine that is more reliable. As odd as it might sound, I would be more inclined to have a $1,000 more solidly built machine repaired for $300 than one that costs less than $600."
242,5.0,2022-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent machine as long as you get a good one. My first Breville Barista Express came that it didn’t work properly. Amazon exchanged it with no problems. I highly recommend this espresso machine for serious coffee drinkers. Machine does everything for you to enjoy a good cup of coffee. I use my machine everyday so there’s no need for a scale to weigh your coffee grounds. If your coffee doesn’t taste good you’re probably buying bad coffee. This machine makes great coffee.
243,5.0,2022-06-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I hate this expresso machine so much. We haven’t even been using it a year and it’s broken 2 times. The grinder keeps breaking. I keep paying to send it back to Breville and they “fix it” and it breaks again 3 months later. I hate it so much I wish we never spent the $700 we worked hard to save for for this coffee machine. I’ve never been so dissatisfied before with a purchase from Amazon and the company of Breville.
244,5.0,2019-03-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After extensive research, my husband and I made this our joint Christmas gift in 2018 and a year later we still think it's the best gift we ever gave ourselves. For context, we used to own a coffee house with a professional-grade machine and know that this one is not that, but we've also used a home machine that cost four or five times what this one does, and feel this one outshined it.

Some things to consider . . . you'll need to spend some time with it to get the grind settings dialed in and to do the regular maintenance of cleaning and changing the water filter (the machine does have lights to tell you when it's time for the latter). Using the machine can be a messy affair and we are fussy about keeping it clean, so we actually keep ours right next to the sink. This allows us to fill the tank with our pull-out faucet, which makes it really easy. Also, the steam wand usually releases straight water for few seconds before it gets up to temp and it's good to be able to run it to clear milk out, so having it pointed directly at the sink is a big plus.

In the end, we are very happy with the crema and flavor of our espresso and the speed and ease with which we can make it. I regularly drink my americano black for the first time in 30 years and never regret it, but also love being able to have fresh steamed milk/half & half as well. Pro-tip for iced coffee drinkers - we also have a Nespresso milk frother that I use in the cold mode for iced drinks."
245,5.0,2022-05-15, Black Sesame,My research showed this to be the best machine in its price range. I have had it for a month now and have nothing but good things to say about it. The attached bur grinder produces consistent results and the espresso is easy to regulate. The steamer is also easy to use and produce consistent results. Take time to learn the machine and practice and you will not be disappointed.
246,5.0,2022-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a very nice design, with the transformation from beans to lattes all in one compact, attractive machine. It fits well on our counter next to two other Breville products. The time to heat up or reheat after use is very fast compared to other espresso machines I have used. The net result is that we make lattes more often now that it’s much less effort."
247,5.0,2020-10-27, Black Sesame,"The package that the coffee machine came in was great. The shipping and delivery process was fast and painless. As for the product itself…it does what it says it does and brews great tasting coffee. It makes me feel like a barista but without the added cost of going to one. My machine looks great and functions well. I highly recommend it to the above average coffee drinkers. If you like black coffee and that’s it…this is not for you.

Bring on the tasty coffee"
248,4.0,2021-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this machine for 6 months now & waited to write a review until I had time with it. It seems like a very good machine. It takes a week or so to get some of the settings exactly to your liking (bean grind, coffee volume for basket). It does go through a LOT of water, at least compared to other espresso machines I've had, so be prepared to fill it up every few days, and to empty the base of LOTS of water. I like it that the base has a floating ""Empty"" sign that rises up when it needs emptying. I like the built in bean grinder feature. Daily cleaning of the steam wand, basket, etc. are essentially the same as any other machine."
249,4.0,2022-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this espresso machine for a few weeks now and I've had a chance to really determine what I like/don't like about it. First of all, i should mention that I went from the inexpensive Bella espresso maker, returned that, then went to a DeLonghi, returned that (twice, because the first one was broken!) and then finally bit the bullet and spent the extra dollars on this Breville. It was an excellent move! NO regrets!!

PROS:
In comparison to my previous machines this is a BEAST. It is heavy, sturdy, well made and just a beautiful machine all around.
Makes excellent espressos and various coffee drinks.
Water filter included.
Love the little thing that pops up and tells you to empty the tray.
Customizable (you can change the temperature and apparently the expressed volume, but I have yet to do that)
Built in grinder
Comes with all necessary accessories

CONS:
There is a learning curve. I'd say it took me about 3 days (and a lot of coffee) to get the settings right. (I was determined to use the single wall filter and make the perfect espresso)
If you make espresso 2-3 times a day like me, you're emptying out the collection tray quite often.
Steam wand/frother is also a learning curve--that one took me two weeks to learn how to do it correctly and to froth perfectly...still get some bad froth, but it's hit and miss.
Also if you make as much coffee as me, you're filling the water reservoir more often.

I absolutely love this machine! I gave it four stars because I have learned that I really should only give it five stars if it is perfect. It's not perfect, but it is awesome and I feel like I saved myself future headache by returning the other machines that didn't work for me and landing on this one. I had my eye on this one for a LONG time and it was on my wishlist, but it was just so expensive. If you keep an eye on the price here on Amazon, eventually it will go down, but grab it FAST, because I missed a couple of price drops on here. I would go to ask hubby if we could get it because the price went down and then later came back to purchase and they were sold out. So I obsessively checked Amazon and happened to grab when a seller dropped a price....this time not even asking hubby. ;)"
250,5.0,2021-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,We decided to convert from Nespresso to an espresso machine and this model is fabulous. The key is the automatic dose for the coffee grinds. This allows novice users to get a consistent shot. Also using the steam wand produces the sweetest milk that combines to provide a truly rich deep flavored latte. It took a day or so to get all the adjustments set how we like. But the instructions are easy to follow and now we have a great process and highly reliable pulls. We love using ours.
251,5.0,2021-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I watched many reviews before choosing this machine. I found that it was IMO the best bang for your buck. It was also the only machine with a grinder, which if bought separately would have run me another $150+. Other features that influenced my decision were the swivel milk steam wand, magnetic tamper, pressure gauge and the thermo coil instead of a thermo block.

This was my first espresso machine and it was mainly for my girlfriend as I don't drink much coffee. After receiving it we are both very happy with the machine. It makes delicious espresso and I have found myself using it just as much as her. It seems to be of very good quality. Nothing feels cheep and everything on the machine works exactly as advertised. There is no ""well I have to kind of do it this way to get it to do what it's supposed to."" Both my girlfriend and I are engineering majors and kind of geeks for well engineered products and this is one of them! We love that everything is ""Over Engineered."" Anyone would be able to see that every part of the machine was well thought out, even the silly, but awesome, empty me float that comes up when the drip tray is full.

The machine itself is not too big to fit in a small kitchen. The grinding feature works well and smells great in the morning. The milk steaming wand works well and is easy to move where needed. It was very easy to open up, follow the quick start guide and start making espresso. The water tank lid/handle is a little bit of a pain to lift up because the tabs that it snaps on to hold it a little too well in my opinion. Not a deal breaker but I just figured I'd talk about everything. The grinding hopper comes off with ease and doesn't spill a bean! the drip tray is very easy to empty and clean. The portafilter is tight when locking but I imagine that is how they all are to create a good seal.

Overall I highly Highly recommend this machine. Like I said earlier I'm no espresso connoisseur so I cant really say it makes the best espresso ever but it is certainly the best I've ever had!!! A rich flavor that stays with me and makes me want more.

Great Machine and I will be looking at Breville when I need appliances in the future"
252,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have had this thing for just over two weeks now and so far loving it. I've never owned an espresso machine before and was a little leery of spending so much on our very first one, but I'm glad I did. 6 YouTube videos later I was making great lattes by my second try! They've all been super consistent and fantastic tasting. If this is your first, I strongly recommend watching a number of videos on how to properly set the grinder, press the puck and froth the milk. If this is not your first, you'll have no trouble setting this up and making great shots right out of the box.

From the instant you unbox it you'll notice how sturdy the construction is. Warning: This is not a light machine. I feel like it is very well constructed and its bit of weight helps it to really stick to the counter.

The grinder does a great job, though for a newbie like me it can seem complicated as it has a lot of settings combinations. Fortunately it didn't need much adjustment out of the box to get a good grind and brewing pressure. I've only used one bean so far, so I'll write back later when I've had to make adjustments for the next bag.

The milk steamer works very well and only took me two tries to get a perfect foam and temperature. Many of the videos you'll find give a good idea of how to best gage the milk without needing a thermometer. Being a single boiler means you can't steam and brew at the same time, but as long as you have everything in place and ready to roll from step to step this is not an issue.

The pressure gage takes all the guess work out of the brewing process. Having it available will let you know very quickly if your brew is processing properly. My first was packed way to tight and therefore sent the gage near its max, telling me before I even tried it that I wasn't going to have a good tasting shot. Every shot since has landed right in the middle and tasted great.

As a novice barista, I'd definitely recommend this machine. While it is a little pricey, assuming no issues for a long time it'll quickly pay for itself."
253,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine makes a barista out of anyone with just a little skill and direction. We have to ration our lattes!! Such a wonderful machine. Follow the directions and buy a good coffee bean. So much better than our previous cheaper machine. We are buying a lot more milk per week now!!!
254,4.0,2022-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s a really cool and nice product very heavy. Not the easiest to clean but over all the misses is happy
255,5.0,2019-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is one of the best choices for beginner coffee lovers. Very easy to use, you will see rich crema if you dial in correctly for your beans. Came with 4 different filters and pretty much everything you will need to make a good cup of espresso or latte. The steel quality of the parts seems very durable. Cleaning is very easy, it also has a cleaning mode which you can program.
If you think the pressure is too low even if you already turned the grinder adjuster to the finest level, don't forget that there's another inner adjuster under the bean container.
Overall, absolutely love it, if you are interested in some barista training at home, this is the one you should go with."
256,5.0,2020-12-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine, it turned me from Uber coffee man getting my wife’s coffee from Starbucks to barista man making my wife’s coffee in minutes and she takes a quad shot. Not only a time saver but a budget saver, price of a quad shot latte went from approx $7.00/drink to only $2.00 or less. Using lavazza gran crema beans I only had to deliver a double shot to get her out of bed for around $1.50 a drink. That’s for the beans the syrup the cup the distilled water the mineral packets for said distilled water to deliver the best cup that can be had. The machine is easy to use and tweak for grind size, temperature, amount of espresso delivered via a double shot basket. Consistency is key I always weigh out my beans 18 grams for a double shot, make sure I pour a single blank shot of water through the basket first, wipe it dry then dispense the grinds, use a distribution tool to produce a uniform top and then tamp in the same way every time. Consistent approach makes a difference. Dialing in the right grind size is crucial and using the pressure gauge and dispense volume help to ensure that you are in the Goldilocks zone with your grind and at most I’ve had to dump 2 or 3 baskets dialing in a new coffee. Overall I’m very happy with the purchase and although I don’t drink as much coffee as my wife this machine gets used frequently. I’m on my second kilo of beans and haven’t been disappointed by its consistency and quality once the grind is dialed in."
257,5.0,2021-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It does take some fiddling to get it setup to your preferences. It does heat up very quickly and steams milk very quickly indeed. Would have liked a injector style wand for the milk, but we are learning to make it frothy through technique. We have had it about a month and it is still working, so happy about that.

Coffee use is rather higher than with my previous breville, accustomed to using about a pound weekly, now closer to 1.5. Kind of annoying as it grinds directly into the basket and always seems to spill a bit. But then again I spilled some when I was loading the baskets by hand as well. The grinder is nice, but I'm concerned about the longevity of this machine. When the grinder goes out I know I'm not going to be able to fix it.

Well here it is some 2 years and 10 months after purchase. I have enjoyed my Breville espresso maker for all this time. I use it to draw 8 shots a day, sometimes more, rarely less. I was eventually able to set the machine up so that coffee wastage was minimized, but again, coffee spills, either when loading by hand or by machine. As I stated previously I was concerned about the grinder and my concerns have been born to fruition, yes the grinder has died. Motor spins but the grinder no longer grinds the coffee. The wet side of the machine still works however. I contacted Breville about a replacement and they don't sell replacement parts to us regular humans. I was offered a path to resolution, unfortunately that costs roughly 1/2 of the price of the machine. For that I get pre-paid shipping to and from the Breville repair facility and of course the repair. Not sure if I am going to take them up on that or get a new smaller machine that does not have a grinder built in to the housing. Again, this is not really a complaint so much as just my experience with the machine YMMV. The machine still looks brand new, still draws an excellent shot of espresso, just have to have an external grinder now.

Well the machine quit yesterday. won't develop pressure any longer. So a bit more than $100.00 a year, not terrible considering the retail cost of all that espresso. Might buy a new one, maybe not. Lasted 5 years and one month."
258,5.0,2020-07-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What a machine! I agree with other reviews here that it is best to judge this kind of espresso maker based on its function. It requires reading up on the variables on how to make great espresso and frothing milk. You either want a pod maker that is fully automated or you want to get involved with the coffee making process. If you want a Keurig-style, pop-a-pod-in-and-go machine, you are better off with a different type of machine.

But if you are interested in making your own coffee, this machine is excellent. It creates a wonderful balance between coffee by hand and automation. The coffee ground size and amount need to be dialed in a bit when you first get the machine but once you get it worked out you won't have to fiddle with them unless you make a significant change to your coffee setup. The built-in grinder makes prepping the coffee as simple as one push of the portofilter. Tamping takes a few presses to get used to but - again - it's quick to get dialed in. All in all, creating an espresso is almost as quick as using a pod-based device and faster than making a pour-over. Making lattes or cappuccinos is almost as quick as you can pour the espresso shot and froth the milk simultaneously.

The machine seems well-built and the layout is logical. There are thoughtful touches that make it clear that quite a bit of thought went into designing the device. For example there is a small sign that pops up automatically to warn you if your spill filter is close to full. There is an reminder you can set to show you when your water filter needs to be changed. The filter baskets can be stored inside the machine and away from sight so you don't have to put the ones you aren't using somewhere else.

I highly recommend this device if you enjoy the process of coffee-making. You can make great espresso, latte, cappuccino and even americano with it, all in a reasonably small counter footprint."
259,3.0,2020-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I received the renewed product and did not know about it.

Its pretty tough to get the portafilter on the machine unlike everyone else.

Steam sprays water too often. not a happy buyer."
260,5.0,2021-02-09, Black Sesame,"I love my breve latte. I love coffee and espresso. I often roast green beans. I spend a lot at local coffee shops and most of them don't taste very good to me. After reading the manual, my first run of the machine produced the very best double shot latte I've had in a very long time. I expected a little buyer's remorse after spending $600 but I couldn't be happier with the machine. Simple, easy and the cleanup is fantastic. The puck comes out solid, not a soupy mess. Buy it... you won't regret it."
261,5.0,2022-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had home espresso machines since before Starbucks got into the coffee shop trade. Over that time, there have mostly been OMG expensive near-professional machines as well as cheezy Walmart-quality machines that were nothing really more than ""strong coffee brewers"". While you could make the earlier machines perform if you knew what you were doing, the results were seldom on par with a good espresso shop cup. Breville has changed that narrative with this machine. You can make espresso shots and drinks on par with the better espresso bars, and certainly much better than anything Starbucks has produced in the past 20 years. Like all crafts though, you have to take time and learn how to make espresso in the first place. If you are a ""one button wonder"", skip this machine and stick with the stuff you get from Starbucks. But if you know how to select and grind beans. If you know how to tamp the coffee. If you know how to time the shots, then this machine will deliver an excellent cup each time. It is quality, easy to keep clean and steams milk superbly. Definetely worth the price. I have had one for over four years and bought this one as a wedding present."
262,5.0,2020-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this as a temporary machine for our cafe until we could buy a commercial one. After one year, it’s still hanging on!!! I have put more wear on this machine than it is meant to withstand. Even after making 10+ drinks in a row, it still works! The grinder is good. The beverage quality is fantastic!
My complaints: It is way slower than a commercial grade. I wish it could steam the milk faster. You can’t steam and brew espresso at the same time. The milk really sticks to the wand which I didn’t have happen when I worked with a commercial grade."

264,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"As a novice barista I don’t have much to say that the other VERY thorough reviews have covered, but I wanted to add my opinion to the list. I’m very happy with this espresso machine, which I bought after returning a cheaper DeLonghi unit. I like that this unit is ready to go in just a few seconds (the other one needed 15 minutes to warm up) and that the hopper does a good job of dispensing the correct grind size and amount, once you dial it in. I will say that the grinder does spill a fair bit of espresso, which might have been avoided with some chute or something to guide the espresso better into the portafilter.

I haven’t used the milk frother, so I can’t comment on its effectiveness. I wasn’t impressed when I did try it, but I also didn’t read the instructions so it might need to be primed before putting in the milk or something. I only use the machine to recreate my Starbucks doubleshot on ice, and it’s great for that. I’ve gotten it nearly indistinguishable from what can be bought at SB for $6.

Overall? Great machine. Lots of adjustments for preference and needs. Therefore, lots of fine tuning needed to get a good product out of it, and a bit of a learning curve as well. But it rewards you once you figure it out."
265,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this about two weeks now, and so far I’m really happy with it. It’s pretty easy to use though I did read the manual carefully before my first time using it.

At first I was frustrated with the quality of my espresso; even on the finest setting of the grinder the extraction went too quickly. Then I discovered you can remove the top burr and tighten it further to adjust the grinding range quite a bit. With this I was able to find the choking point of my particular brand of beans and dial back from there.

Overall this machine seems high quality and durable but time will tell. My espresso shots aren’t the best of the best yet, but this is my first espresso machine, and there is a learning curve. Also I think it will take a while for me to come out positive with this from my Starbucks habit because, while a cup of Starbucks is maybe $4 or $5 per latte, a latte from this machine will set you back maybe $1 or $2 if you use quality coffee beans. And since I’m now drinking twice the amount of coffee I used to drink since it’s so accessible .... well, at least I get lots of decent quality espresso drinks now!

Do yourself a favor and get a food scale that can measure tenths of grams, a knock box, and some cleaning tablets!

The one thing that doesn’t work perfectly is the steam wand. It’s supposed to have a standby mode that lasts ten seconds or so, so you can put the wand in your milk jug without spraying milk everywhere. However sometimes when I toggle the steam from standby mode it doesn’t properly register that I am no longer in standby. This means the steam tubing is drained of whatever water and pressure was in it and my steam fizzles out. The workaround for me is to just turn the knob again until the standby light isn’t flashing anymore...

If you like espresso drinks, and convenience, get this! You could probably find a separate grinder and machine for cheaper but this whole suite is compact and works nicely."
266,5.0,2022-07-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I LOVE this espresso machine! I am very picky with my coffee, and I love making myself a good cup of coffee at home rather than to find a starbucks and wait in the long drive-through lines. The quality of the shots are amazing, and I love that you can program how much water pulls through for the single and double shots to make the perfect amount every time. My first espresso machine was a cheap Delongi one from target, which was awesome as a starter espresso machine, but this machine is way better and definitly for those looking to get more café level coffee. I love that i can fit a standard sized coffee cup underneath, saving me dishes to clean up after.
I recommend cleaning/descaling this machine when you get it, like the instructions say to and take a slightly damp rag to the outside of it.
The best accessories to get with this machine would be a knock box so you never leave coffee in the portafiller, a tamp mat to keep tidy, syrups with pumps, rags to spot clean after each use, and I personally like having a whole set up that's my ""coffee bar"" where everything coffee goes on it.
Anyways, I love this machine and think it's worth the investment so far!"
267,5.0,2022-03-20, Black Sesame,"Overall amazing product for the price. Unfortunately you cannot use the steam wand and pull a shot at the same time. Steam wand could be better too. But for a home espresso machine, it’s an all-in-one awesome device."
268,2.0,2019-10-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had the barista express for about 3 years now. I make 2-4 double shots a day often with steamed milk. This is not an espresso machine but an espresso appliences.
Most of the 5 star reviews appear to be from occasional users or those who had the machine for a short time but the real issue with Breville espresso appliences is long term reliability if you do use them a couple of times a day. These machines are made in china with mostly plastic tubing and valves insides. In fact many critical parts that carry pressure and or temperature are made of plastic. This model has no boiler but simply heats the water on demand it has a rough vibration pump so no one should expect a consistent high quality shot out of this but you can argue that is not possible at this price. The Barista isn’t cheap but it is much cheaper than a real Italian made espresso machine that will se you back at least 4K with a grinder. So putting the performance of this modest appliance aside, the main issue is that it has a short lifespan.
In my case the grind adjustment lever ( made of plastic) broke leaving the burr almost in contact with the basket meaning no coffee will grind. Breville machines are not user serviceable like a high end espresso machine so the only option is to ship the machine to factory and have them service it. In this case the cost was 50% of the value of a new machine for fixing the grinder lever alone. Not really worth it.

I had pulled some good shots from this occasionally but the pump had becomes very inconsistent lately perhaps signs of it giving in.

So overall this is OK for someone who wants to use it occasionally perhaps few times a week but basically a disposable product for a regular volume user."
269,5.0,2022-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you're addicted to Starbucks and drink it 5 or more times a week, you'll save a lot of money right here.

This machine is excellent for the latte hobbyist. I use it 5+ days a week, usually in my morning routine on my way out the door for work. The shot programming is extremely precise, the grinder is rugged, and the overall machine just feels like a great investment.

I've only had to run the cleaning cycle on the head twice in a 12 month period. I also use distilled water to minimize mineral scaling inside the machine. The coffee grinder has a rubber gasket along the lid and holds at least 14 2oz shots.

Tips for use:
Use distilled water to minimize buildup, unless you're comfortable with routine descaling or want mineral water.

Wait to remove the portafilter after you've steamed your milk; you'll have dry puck instead of a soupy one this way.

After removing the portafilter, place the steam wand under the shower head (where the portafilter goes) and run a pulse of water to clean both the head and steam wand (you'll still need to wipe the wand, but this maximizes efficiency). I usually brew a double, so I'll just click for a single.

Wipe down your machine after every use to preserve the beauty of the stainless steel aesthetic.

When the yellow 'Empty Me!"" float comes up from the drip tray, don't mess around. Drain it to prevent a messy overflow.

Take good care of this machine and it'll take good care of you!"
270,3.0,2017-09-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this unit for Christmas and it is now Jan. 24th. Have not been able to get the proper pressure build up and flow. Great little machine which is why I’m not giving up or putting it down. I came across a YouTube video were the poster claims a lot has to do with the consistency of the grind. Like him I tried different grind settings with little result. Today I followed his instructions on adjusting the grind basket’s number setting. It’s set at #6 from the mfr., I turned down to #3. With that adjustment at #3 and the machine’s grind setting wheel on #4 I was able to achieve max pressure. The flow looked decent and the shot had quite a lot of the “creme” on top. So far so good. Will update on status and longevity of these settings. May require small adjustments in the future, but for now pressure achieved all due the grind’s consistency.

Update; 01/25/21,
Side grind setting set to #5. Pressure is holding perfect. Wasn’t satisfied with shot size so back to research. According to video reviews a double shot should be 2oz. With that said the factory setting is off by about 9 seconds of flow to achieve the 2oz. To make the proper adjustments I recommend using a scale to weigh and time the liquid flow. Mine is set to about 2.2oz. Créeme looks awesome, coffee isn’t as bitter, and the longer the flavors stay in your mouth you get hints of Cocoa. Pretty cool actually.

Definitely not a plug and play process. It’s more like an art and science experiment to get the perfect results. Why do think you get charged Barista prices when you go to a coffee shop. It’s all about trial and error. Also these machines are not industrial service style units. Longevity will definitely be a concern. However most is these reviews say that it failed within 3 years. Think about it, how much have you saved in those 3 years by making your own barrista style morning beverage that usually sell for about $7.00?!?"
271,5.0,2022-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got a taste for fancy and exceptional coffee while overseas so while living in the States I decided to save money by not going to get $5 subpar coffee at chains that rhyme with Tarducks and instead bought this after reading many professional and personal reviews.

Took me a while to get the mix, grind, and find the beans I like, but once I did this machine consistently pulled tasty espresso and I was able to hit the sweet spot on the pressure nearly every time (except when I forget to check the water level and waste a cup's worth, smh).

Every brand and machine and whatever has a few defective machine, and bad actors will market used as new. I did a sold/shipped by Amazon and got a clearly new machine that I've followed the maintenance on and it has been stellar.

No regrets, and no caffeine withdrawls for this guy."
272,5.0,2021-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had this model for a month now and have been using it daily for at least 2 lattes each day. After talking with a barista we know, REALLY glad that we got the version with the built-in bean grinder. It is a key item in freshly (and properly) ground beans to make a great espresso/latte. This is my first Espresso maker, so I don't have experience in operational comparison. However, I can say that my 16 year old daughter picked it up right away and got great microfoam on about her third attempt.

The pressure gauge is also great, and although you might think it not necessary, it really does provide great feedback on the grind size and tamping pressure of the coffee cake and how well the water permeates the coffee. All of which help with the overall quality of product. Great adjustment options on the grind size and amount for the cup. Can do singles or doubles and appropriate cups are included. Easy to fill water reservoir with built in filter. Easy to use steam wand, lots of flexibility to get the right angle to the milk pitcher.

Even with the bean holder on top, fits under our standard cabinet height, so it tucks away nicely when not in use (or even during use). There is even a hidden tray for cleaning utensils underneath. Definitely the right purchase for us and totally worth 5 stars.

Now. There are a couple of notes. First, between the over-grinding of coffee spilling on the lower tray, spraying out the steam wand to remove water and to clear out any milk, and some drips from the espresso dispenser, the lower tray and reservoir can get gunky in short order. However, the plastic tray and stainless top and inserts are easily cleanable, but do need to be addressed every other day. They easily pull out and separate and we clean and rinse in the sink.

Aside from this, keep the steam wand clean (wipe down after each steamed milk), change your water filters out regularly (find a generic version as the Breville branded one's are pretty pricey), keep the tray cleaned when needed and you should enjoy really GREAT espresso and lattes for quite some time. This was a GREAT purchase and I am totally happy. Recommended without hesitation."
273,2.0,2022-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"this item was great until a few weeks ago after the manufacture warranty expired then it started to not work, no pressure whatsoever, thank god I got the extended warranty, sorta saved me a little. I really used it intermittently and always used filtered water and followed the cleaning protocol’s and such and it still failed on me. BTW I found this unit cheaper at Bed Bath & Beyond so you may try there instead of amazon to get it.

The warranty is good to a point to get but a couple of things to keep in mind which I wasn’t aware of:
1. only covers the purchase price, doesn’t cover tax or the warranty cost so if you decide to get another it could cost you a couple hundred dollars more to get the same item assuming the price of the machine didn’t increase.
2. I would advise getting the extended warranty because on all of these breville expresso machine, they seem to last about two years, which is annoying given the cost of this machine. I have not seem to find a brand that is durable and long lasting in this price range unless you want to spend several thousand dollars on one.
Would greatly appreciate any insight as to a reliable brand, going to cross my fingers and get a fancier breville unit (the digital touchscreen one) …
heres hoping to no issues after the warranty expires."
274,5.0,2022-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been using a inexpensive espresso maker from walmart for years. That machine would have mood swings and decided whether or not I got a good cup that day. I decided enough is enough and started researching for a good espresso machine. My budget was also an issue so I didn't want to dish out 1k-2ks so I started looking at a few models from breville.
Several of my friends owned this exact model and reviews showed this seemed to be the easiest one to work with with least potential problems. It seems the higher tier you go up, the less work you have to do, but there's potentially more things to fix when it breaks.
This model requires you to self tamper and self froth....which isn't that much work but I know oracle or some other models do it for you. I still prefer to do those myself so this machine was perfect.

I've played with it for about 2 weeks now. So far both the single shot and the double shot comes out great.
I really love this machine and I hope it continues to make good drinks for me for years to come.

Note for potential buyers...read the instructions, CLEAN properly, and read up about making espresso...the amount of beans, the proper pressure etc."
275,5.0,2022-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Everything is highly functional and works very well. Only gripes are the steam wand can be slow to start and there can be multiple pieces to clean - but - it’s easy and taste is AMAZING. I LOVE this machine. At work, we have one in the break room and after several years of numerous users it has never broken - not even once. I’m very happy with my choice, thanks Breville!"
276,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had our machine now a few weeks. For someone who's never used one before, it'll take a little time to learn your settings with the beans you choose. There is a person who wrote a really long review - if you find it, read it! His post was very helpful. The negatives so far: my husband gets up before I do, so unless you kitchen is across the house, you'll hear the machine. 1) Makes noise when you turn it on, when you grind the beans, when you make the espresso shot, and when you use the water outlet. (perhaps they should team up with Elon on how to make a quiet motor). 2) The Dedicated Hot Water Outlet splatters water so you have to hold your cup up very close to it when using it. 3) Contacted Breville over 2 weeks ago about the Drip Tray. It fills up a lot and you have to empty it each day. I contacted Breville to find out if this is normal - CUSTOMER SERVICE IS MIA on that one - still haven't heard from them. 4) MADE IN CHINA - I posted this because I too, like many, we're trying to find where it was made. The positives: Would we buy it again? Yes but we hope Breville will think twice about China and making their products there."
277,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,The breville can produce espresso at the same quality level as a high end coffee shop. I bought this back in 2021 when I started working from home and have made 2-3 espressos daily. I have not purchased a cup of coffee or coffee drink in over a year. Talk about a return on my investment. This is a must buy if you are an espresso drinker.
278,5.0,2022-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love that this has the grinder built in! As I said in the title, this 100% is an entry level machine, but everything that an average Joe would need to make good espresso at home. A dosing cup and tamper/distributor combo take the clumps that the grinder gives right out and make for a consistent shot. The drip tray is very large and offers enough space to only clean once a week or so.

I pre-heat the machine for about 30 min before making a shot and have had no issues with espresso taste.

Do not blame a machine for improper puck preparation or old grounds! Ensure these two steps are not overlooked and you will have good espresso!

Happy sipping!"
279,5.0,2020-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s my second barista express. Had the first one for almost 4 years. Makes amazing espressos. Saves a lot of money compared with going to Starbucks
280,5.0,2020-08-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this machine for nearly two years. For the money it can produce a fine shot of espresso. Realize it will take some practice and learning through trial and error to pull consistently good shots because there are some variables to control--grind, temp, tamping, pre-infusion time, pressure. I will reiterate what other reviewers have said: Freshly roasted beens are paramount. Don't assume you got a dud if your machine isn't building enough pressure. I'll buy beans that were roasted the day before and the pressure gauge will be at the upper limit when I grind on ten (a fairly course grind). Those same beans two weeks later will require grinding at eight or nine to obtain a moderate pressure indication. If I have to grind any finer than that to get adequate pressure, I know the beans are too old to get a good tasting cup of espresso. For extraction, I like to hold down the two cup button at first which puts the machine in manual mode for the ""pre-infusion."" Right when I see the pressure gauge start to move I let off. When I get my two ounces I hit the button again to stop it. Since the variables change from day to day, pulling shots manually is the best way to get consistent results which are on par with decent espresso from a commercial machine operated by a good barista. This machine paid for itself in about a year from what I've saved not going to the coffee shop everyday. The one annoying draw back is the mess it can make on the automatic grind. The manufacturer must have noticed what a mess it makes. It's a good amount of wasted coffee. It seems like it would have been an easy design flaw to correct with some sort of enclosed grind shoot. To prevent the mess, I use the one cup automatic grind setting for the two cup basket. When it's done grinding, I spread it out with my finger and lightly tamp it down by tapping the portafilter on a rubber pad. Then I'll manually grind the rest, stopping once more to spread and tamp down the coffee before using the tamper. So it's not a perfect machine but for the price I am very pleased with what it can do so I think it still deserves five stars."
281,3.0,2021-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Nothing in the packaging. No emails. No USPS mail. What happened to the free coffee promo?

Other than that, the machine works well."
282,5.0,2022-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I do not understand how this thing is only $500. I’m a manager for a cafe and we run a $25,000 4-group La Marzocco, and a $7,000 grinder, and it’s like I never even left the shop. Everything about this product is stellar. The presentation and packaging is great, it comes with everything you need to brew a good shot. All you need is a knock box. I was worried that it would feel kind of cheap due to the price but I was wrong.

-The portafilter is heavy duty, I was worried it would be flimsy. It’s not.
-The grinder produces a consistent grind every time.
-The machine itself looks beautiful and is heavy duty. Not much plastic to be found.
-frothing pitcher is perfect size and is heavy duty.
-steam wand has the perfect amount of power. Allows you to really get the temp and froth perfect. Skilled baristas will have no problem doing great latte art with this machine.
-It’s all in one. No separate grinder needed, and the included grinder is high quality.
-Has a manual dose option for those who are picky about the Grams used in the shot
-Comes with 4 different filter baskets
-Alerts you when the machine needs to be descaled and cleaned (comes with all needed cleaning supplies as well)
-very easy to setup
-shots have good crema, great flow rate, but obviously this will moreso depend on beans and proper dosing, but just know you can make some very good espresso.

I was really considering a La Pavoni for home use, but after reading the reviews on this machine, I decided to go with this one. Best decision I’ve made. It is great for people who are wanting to get into espresso/coffee but don’t want to spend a fortune, yet it is so high quality that a skilled barista can fine tune everything for their idea of a perfect shot."
283,5.0,2021-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’m so glad I purchased this!! This is my first time making my own cappuccinos and I was a little scared to spend this amount of money and be disappointed with the results. My husband and I spend an insane amount at Starbucks, so I went ahead and purchased this unit. All I can say now is “Starbucks who” This machine exceeded my expectations... so easy and user friendly! As expected, I did have to go through some coffee grind settings to find the right blend to reach the proper pressure for my brand (Starbucks Pike Place Roast) grind setting #3 worked for me. I watched a YouTube video to learn how to make a good frothy milk... it’s harder than you may think! Clean up is super easy and because the coffee grinds go right into the portafilter, no mess on your counter top! I love that they incorporated storage in the unit as well. You don’t have to worry about losing the extra pieces that came with the machine.
I also purchased the Breville “mini” knock box and that was the perfect addition to my order. It’s the perfect size and so easy to empty the used coffee grinds into. I would highly recommend this machine to anyone."
284,5.0,2022-04-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great machine for the home coffe enthusiast. It comes with the grinder, for espresso only, and has enough adjustments for the quality that you can produce with this machine. Dialing the right ground size for the beans you are using can be tricky but once you hit the spot this machine can produce great quality espresso.

While working through your grind settings I would recommend not wasting that coffee and make some lattes, you can produce great milk texture with the froather and try your luck with latte art. Texturing your milk might take a little long because is not an overwhelming powerful steam but it does the job.

Only thing I don't like is that it releases steam after you make espresso and/or use the steam wand. The steam released condensates at the bottom of the machin and produces some water to get into the tool compartment behind the spill tray. Not a big deal just have to keep it dry.

I do recommend turning on the machine at least 5 minutes before you brew to warm up everything. Cleaning well after you are done using it and keeping that steam wand clean at all times.

Other than that I am very pleased with this machine so far, I think I would give it a try as a coffe cater."
285,5.0,2022-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We already had the exact same maschine in Germany under another brand name. I was so glad to find it here in in the US (even under a another brand).

Hope this helps..."
286,5.0,2021-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is a beast. It's seen daily use for the last 4 years, with between 3-5 lattes a day being made on it. I had to replace the grinder assembly about four months ago; the gears that drive the burr grinder had become stripped over constant use. It was a bit of a pain, but is the only maintenance work I've had to do on it. OEM parts were available online in any case, and they're pretty affordable (entire grinder assembly was ~$55).

The machine: pulls great espresso 99% of the time. Every once in a while I get these weird pulls where the machine just quits. I'm pretty consistent with my tamping but sometimes I'll end up sacrificing a shot because the machine will only put out a slight dribble of espresso.

The steamer wand is pretty great once you get the hang of it. I find that it works best to let the steamer wand heat up / spit out water, briefly turn it off, put the wand in the milk jug, then quickly turn it back on without the wand needing to re-heat.

I've been looking at possible upgrades but keep coming back to this-- it's pretty much perfect for the price point (get it refurbished if you can!)"
287,4.0,2018-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I used to work at a coffee shop for a few months, and always wanted to have a home espresso machine in my own kitchen without spending a fortune on it. But, if you have ever tried to buy one of these, you know that any decent espresso machine will cost you an arm and a leg!

Finally, after extensive research for half a year (!!), I decided to go with a Breville BES870XL; they have some features that make them quite unique at this price. First of all, they come with a relatively decent grinder (while a standalone one can be very expensive), they have almost all the features that you expect from a professional espresso machine, and they give you a lot of room to tweak the details (enabling one to control the brew ratio, brew temperature, etc.)

My only concern was that there were a lot of complaints about the durability of these, and (no need to say) I wanted something that could give me four cappuccinos a day for a long time! But, I had also realized that this was one of the biggest complaints with almost all home espresso machines that where below $1,200/1,500 range. Thus, I decided to proceed with my decision, but to add a 4-year protection plan (for an additional $60), for my peace of mind.

I have been using my Breville BES870XL for almost two months now, and I have been pulling (on average) four shots a day. It certainly meets the expectations regarding a home espresso machine, and more. When buying one, you have to keep in mind that you won't be dealing with a commercial machine: it is not as fast a commercial and expensive machine, your shots are not as stable as you want them to be (after controlling for brew ratio, brewing time, etc.) as a result of strange changes in pressure, etc.

But, as long as you stay committed to the science of making coffee (e.g. controlling your grind size, tampering, weighting the coffee in your portafilter and liquid in your cup, not storing roasted coffee for a long time at the wrong place, etc.) you can pull very decent shots that are still better than the shots you get in a lot of coffee houses.

I will keep this review updated in case I encounter any problem with this espresso machine; i.e. hopefully, never!"
288,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this unit for over a year now and have had no issues (knock on wood). Can be a messy unit, but if you get a couple accessories the mess is almost non-existent.
1. I purchased the knock box for quick disposal of grinds. This saves you from having to go to the trash can each time (gross).
2. Flask with temperature indicator. Helps get milk to temp without holding it constantly.
3. Portafilter extended ring. It sits on top of the filter and eliminates grinds getting everywhere when auto grinding. It doesn’t fit in the designed holder location with it on it, but I press the button with the handle of my spoon and hold it underneath it to catch grinds. You can tamp with it on the filter and really helps with the grinds everywhere issue.
4. Good cotton cloths.
5. Breville approved cleaners and descaler.

Different coffees take different grind size and amount settings, but once you get your temperatures and settings right it is really user friendly at that point. Also program your own cycle to get the best espresso for your liking. I make approximately 2-3 double shot espresso drinks a day with it and follow all cleaning instructions using Breville approved cleaners.
Would definitely purchase again."
289,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Well, I have used for 3 months now and it is simply amazing. Making espresso and frothing milk requires some skills and YouTube videos to be able to master it, however I was able to relatively get a decent capuchino right after unboxing it.

Of course that I read the full manual while I was waiting to receive it from Amazon, which actually got lost initially, but Amazon quickly send its replacement.

I have been making coffee practically daily since I got it and mastering the art of it. I have read a lot of reviews with issues with the machine, but I have not experienced a single one. Maybe the secret is that I used purified water and that I have removed the filter. I also clean the infusion holder almost every time after I use it.

On one occasion the range went above the “espresso range” but I quickly discovered that there were some holes in the filter stuck with coffee powder. I quickly unclog them with the provided tools and things went back to normal. Since then I always inspect for no clogged holes in the filter.

I’m pretty happy tasting different coffee beans that supermarkets offers around my neighborhood, but currently I’m very happy with the freshly roasted beans that Peet’s offer directly at their stores.

It takes some seconds to have steam out of the wand and I imagine that top of the line machine have it no time, but I think in this price range is the best.

Quick Tip: If you use the double shot filter as I usually do, set your grind to one shot, level the powder and repeat the process. This prevents the ground coffee to overflow the filter if you set it for two shots."
290,4.0,2022-06-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazed at how much money I was wasting at coffee shops. I always thought getting a good latte would be too hard at home. This works really well. I can pretty confidently say you can make drinks as good as the ones you get at starbucks with this machine. In fact, now when I get starbucks or whatever chain, I notice it tastes... burnt. Low quality.

The problem with this machine, and why I'm not giving it 5 stars, is its initial set up phase can be tedious. There's a pressure gauge you're supposed to get your espresso to to make it taste good. There's a lot of trial and error to get there, it doesn't seem to always work out of the box. This is made worse by the fact there's at least three separate components that will influence this, from the burr grinder inside the machine, to the outside grind controls, to the force you tamp it down with. I had to watch a few videos to get it just right and always hitting the right pressure. When I got there, it was great"
291,5.0,2021-07-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this about a month ago and thought I'd give it some time to review. This is my first espresso machine, and I must say, I am very impressed.

The reason I bought it was mainly because I was tired of reloading my Starbucks card, and I missed real Italian espressos from Italy. I had tried brewing with Moka pots, but it just didn't work out. The Breville is spot-on!

At first, like everyone else, I had a bit of a hard time getting the dial to register correctly in the espresso range. Finally I settled on the Starbucks espresso beans with the grind set to 3. When you grind the beans, start off just barely filling the filter, then gently pressing the grounds to the sides. After that, grind a little more just so you can make a little rounded hill. Then, tamp firmly.

Milk frothing is a breeze as well. There were some YouTube videos I watched to get an idea of how to do it. Honestly it's not a difficult machine to use. My 11-year old daughter has the whole process down pat and has officially become the family barista. My wife won't drink a capuccino unless my daughter made it.

UPDATE--After nearly a year, this thing is still chugging along! Two things stand out as must-do's to keep it that way:
- Clean regularly -- I had let the grinder get clogged up and it wasn't grinding as well. Routine grinder cleaning is essential, as is regular descaling and cleaning using the tablets.

Also, I do have to say that you should call customer support when you're not sure what's going on. I had a problem also with the pressure and found out that because of the beans I used, I needed to change the grind size to a finer grind. Not only did they help me figure it out, they also sent me some Breville descaler and cleaning tablets free because the machine was still under warranty. That's worth an extra star in my book!"
292,5.0,2022-03-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Things you should know about this machine:
First, as others have said in their reviews, read and follow the instructions--do not just open the box and wing it, because there are some complexities here! However, after a couple of days of using it, it's a quick, easy task to make perfect coffee every time.
Second, refilling the beans and water is simple, as is basic cleaning (after a month and a half of use, we haven't had to do a full cleaning/descaling yet).
Third, there are a ton of settings and options, so you can get as fancy as you want, but the default settings, which we use, work great.
Fourth, the price--sure, you'll end up spending about a thousand dollars to get the machine plus all the things you probably want to have with it (a knock box for grounds, flavored syrups, pumps for the syrups, etc.), but it's worth keeping in mind that that's the equivalent of 200 coffees from that place I won't mention here. What this machine will make is just as good (if not better), will be made right the first time, and won't involve a bored barista misspelling your name.
tl;dr: great espresso maker that's well worth the expense."
293,5.0,2022-03-23, Black Sesame,"A rare example of the meeting of form and function. This machine is both beautiful to look at and makes wonderful delicious espresso and cappuccino. I was hesitant to spend this much on a ""coffee maker"", but took into consideration what it costs to get a decent cappuccino from a cafe or Starbucks and finally gave in. Boy am I glad I did. All it takes to get me out of bed in the morning is the happy thought of pulling yet another delicious shot from this wonderful machine.

A few tips for beginners, which I am as well. Really pay attention to the gauge and make sure you're not over or under extracting your shots. This will greatly affect flavor. The three variables you need to nail down are tamping pressure, grind fineness and the amount of coffee being ground. I suggest starting with the default middle values and seeing what you get. If there is coffee spilling all over the place, grind less. If you feel like you're tamping correctly but still getting under extraction, grind finer. Don't be afraid to take it down to One for both grind amount and fineness. See what happens. There will be a few days of trial and error before you get it right. Meanwhile you can perfect your milk frothing technique. Don't get frustrated, just keep tweaking one variable at a time until you get it. And you will. I promise.

From that point forward you will be drinking cappuccinos and lattes that are likely better than what you'd get from the local Starbucks. I'm not kidding. You'll also discover the subtle flavors that you previously didn't notice. Hints of cherries, or orange, or chocolate will emerge from your espresso. Try different types of beans. Get them as freshly roasted as possible. Hopefully there is a local roaster you can get your beans from. Look for a ""Roasted on"" date.

I hope the above is helpful. There are many videos and tutorials out there, be sure to check them out as well. Keep trying until you get that magical perfect sip. Heaven."
294,5.0,2020-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you want to make real Italian espresso coffee, look no further, this is IT. Once you get a basic handle of the machine and how it works, you’ll be making perfect espressos over and over, it does not fail if you follow basic guidelines for quantity, hand pressure, etc. It is a bit more expensive than other models out there, BUT:

- The grinder is great, with auto or manual options to fill the filter, and a good amount of whole beans in the hopper
- Stainless steel all around, which makes it more durable
- Large capacity for water on the back (although keep in mind that it does use a lot of water, especially when using the steamer/frother)
- The portafilters are great, stainless steel and sturdy, and you get 4, 2 for preground coffee and 2 for beans (1-2 cup options each case)
- The option to use preground, in our case, is phenomenal, as we use a lot of Lavazza preground and we love it almost as much as whole beans

Overall, we are loving this machine. I take care mostly of the espressos, and the wifey is the master cappuccino maker. Very happy with this purchase and highly recommended!"
295,1.0,2022-04-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I LOVED this machine. Some cold mornings, it’s really what gets me out of bed and makes me excited to start my day. When it works, it works really well. I did a lot of research and after never using any type of coffee or espresso machine, I decided to buy it. It was very easy to learn to use after watching 15 mins of you tube videos. It is not intimidating and it looks really nice sitting on the counter. My issue is with the quality and reliability of the product. Our first unit started having issues around 3.5 weeks in. The dial which determines if you’re going to get steam or hot water started to stick and not turn easily. Since it was within Amazon return period, I exchanged it for the same unit. Dealing with Amazon is easy.

Fast forward to this week (6 months after receiving the replacement unit) and said unit has decided to not dispense the espresso. There is zero pressure at all. The unit will turn on. It sounds like it’s working and then nothing. I pulled out the book and went through all the trouble shooting and couldn’t get it to work. Still zero pressure and a drip here and there from the port filter. I watched multiple Breville and others on YouTube to trouble shoot what could be going on (we emptied out and put in fresh beans, made sure the grind wasn’t too big or too small; water was in unit; we even did cleaning cycles and descaling. We used the part that causes pressure to back up and clean the unit- nothing..zero pressure. I even dragged my engineer hubby into fixing it to no avail (he usually can get everything to work). The unit is being packed up and shipped for repair to Breville. They were pleasant to work with but I want my $600 plus machine to work and don’t want to wait weeks to get it back. If I was starting this process of buying a unit, Imwould probably opt for a different unit given that I have dealt with having issues with two of them in such a short period of time. If this until lasted even two years then maybe I could justify the cost a little more but two units in six months with different problems concerns me."
296,5.0,2022-04-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Yes, it has a learning curve. Yes, you're likely going to have to get a few accessories to make up for its shortcomings. However, this thing makes very solid espresso, just as good as, or better than, local coffee shops.

This thing usually goes on sale for $100 off, and around that price range you can't get much better. A few options other than this are Gaggia Classic Pro / Breville Bambino paired with separate grinder Breville Smart Grinder Pro / 1Zpresso JX-PRO (totaling $600-$650 ... so similar to this).

The one thing the Barista Express has over any other espresso machine available is the HUGE amount of online content around this machine. You can get accessories made specifically for tweaking the espresso on this machine, there's YouTube channels dedicated to just this machine, and you can really learn the ins and outs of espresso.

After you play with this machine for 3-4 years, you can keep it in good shape and sell it (or it might break, who knows) then you can upgrade to all the fancy grinders and machines, but if you want to get your feet wet in espresso world: THIS is the unit to buy."
297,5.0,2022-03-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am so glad that I purchased this espresso machine. My husband has been asking for one for the past year and I finally decided to take the leap.

This machine is very well made which one would expect from any Breville product. The only downfall to the construction is that it is very heavy however, to me this is also a good thing.

This machine has a coffee bean Grinder built right into the machine. The cool factor of this Grinder is that it has the ability to grind at different levels. I love super fine ground coffee and I get a great grind with this machine. The grind dispenser took a little getting used to, if you press in the espresso cup once it auto fills to the amount you indicate on the nob. If you continue pressing and holding it allows you to choose when the machine stops dispensing grounds.

The espresso feature on this machine works perfectly, there is a Gauge that tells you whether the cup is filled enough when making the espresso. If the cup is under-filled it will indicate that the pressure is low and if the cup is over -filled it indicated that it is over pressured. This system makes it easy to get the perfect esspresso every time.

The steam feature on this machine also takes a little practice but once you get the hang of it works absolutely flawlessly. Simply flip the switch and wait for the steam, turn off, insert nozzle and turn steam back on. I do recommend using a very small amount of milk if you want a full froth as with high levels of milk it doesn't get as frothy.

Another added feature of this machine is the neat hot water feature. This feature makes making hot chocolate and other powdered drinks a blast. I have also used it for my instant oatmeal in the morning.

The machine comes with some very handy tools as well. You get an espresso press for pressing the grounds firmly into the espresso cup. A cleaning kit for the machine, and an espresso razor which helps to ensure you make the exact right amount of espresso everytime.

Overall I have been beyond overjoyed with this product and would highly recommend it."
298,5.0,2021-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s a lot of money. Through some unfortunate circumstances, I found myself in a position of having enough money to buy this without feeling sick to my stomach. So I bought it. And it is absolutely worth every single penny."
299,5.0,2017-06-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have had this machine for almost 3 months now. Doesn't feel plastic and cheap. We love how everything is customizable, from the grind amount & size to the length of brew. Although it is not a ""push-button"" cup of espresso, it takes me about 5 minutes to make a cappuccino, including steaming the milk, and clean-up. Add some fancy flavoring and you are saving thousands every year by not going to the coffee shop for that special drink every day. Worth it!
**Tip: buy some decaf beans for the first couple of weeks when you want to keep testing it out. Otherwise, you will be up all night from the ""practice shots""."
300,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"4 WEEKS IN REVIEW:
This is not an entry level espresso machine, it requires a bit of tuning and know how. If you want an easy espresso machine this is not for you.

Tips:
1. Use “fresher” beans and store them correctly. I was using some trader joe espresso beans and I had to use the double wall basket to get correct pressure. The single wall is better to use.

2. I removed the plastic insert in the portafilter, it collects water and I have not noticed any difference since removal.

3. Use a scale to tune the grinder to get the right dosage, I aim for 17g for a double. This is where the machine falls short, its dosage is not very consistent but it grinds well.

4. Get a knock box, tamping mat, and a scale to make espresso making easier.

5. Use a kitchen towel or wash cloth instead of paper towels.

6. This thing uses a lot of water especially when you froth your milk. If your tap water isn't good enough for this machine like mine expect to buy a couple more gallons a week.

Im currently using lavazza super crema and I finally achieved consistent pulls with the single wall basket that taste great with good pressure. The trader joes espresso had inconsistent pulls and would not work well in the single basket.

All around I love this machine. It will be well worth the money If it lasts for a long time. If you want to improve your espresso set up in your house I strongly recommend this machine."
301,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Many people have written extremely detailed reviews on this machine, which were very helpful to me when making my purchase & after receiving the unit... so I will keep this review simple. The machine is high quality and will enable you to make wonderful espresso beverages - after practicing & identifying the correct settings for your preferred espresso beans. Practice & more importantly, read the instructions! Keep your machine clean and you will be fine. I feel it is worth the money, but I truly love coffee/espresso (important to have something you love during this covid-shit & while working from home).

*** For those looking to buy the black sesame unit - a few things to consider... first, the finish is highly polished (shiny) & does not look matte black how it does in the picture (this may have been provided within the product details, if so I missed it)... second, it is very easy to scratch the finish. I had the portafilter graze the edge of the unit ever so lightly & it scratched the black finish right off - my wife and I were shocked. If you are heavy-handed/meat-fisted then you may want to consider the stainless steel model... You've been warned!"

303,5.0,2014-02-03, Black Sesame,"I can not say enough good things about this.

It is sturdy, well made and makes a great espresso. While not inexpensive, it seems worth the money. The grinder work fine and is not fussy with the bean that I put into it. The build quality is very high. The steam is strong and it froths the milk without issue. It seems a happy price point between the cheap machines and the very expensive ones.

No issues to report and I am very happy. I would buy again."
304,4.0,2017-04-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. I had an old Mr coffee espresso maker that I used for 5 years until it broke. so I went on amazon and wanted to get a nicer espresso maker. I saw the great reviews and chose the barista express. then I watched a few videos on how to use this thing. as there is quite the learning curve to make the perfect latte. however I adore this thing. every day I wake up so excited to make coffee now. I love the process. I love the delicious lattes.

when I started using local roasted coffee it blew me away. I now make the best coffee I ever tasted. because you can dial in the exact flavor profile you like. its amazing.

so why 4 stars then? because a lot of fake reviews are 5 stars. and this is not a fake review. this machine is my favorite thing besides my car and my watch. And now I understand what another reviews said. they said, and I can totally relate, they said "" if a theif stole my machine, I would buy another one the same day without flinching"" or something like that. I would so do the same."
305,5.0,2022-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Estoy asombrado con este producto, inicialmente considere que el precio era un poco elevado hasta q probé el primer café. Fue perfecto. La instalación es muy sencilla y la guía que brinda Breville es bastante buena. Al principio hay q hacer varias pruebas hasta lograr el balance perfecto entre café y agua lo que significa que vas a desperdiciar bastantes granos. Como punto a tener en cuenta es que la máquina hace un poco de ruido cuando muele los granos y cuando está en el proceso de extracción que para algunas personas les podrá parecer molesto pero que en mi parecer no es algo que sea impactante. El único contra que identifico es q se ensucia muy fácilmente y si quieres q el producto te dure tendrás que limpiarlo al menos una vez por semana."

307,5.0,2022-01-12, Black Sesame,"When my little Starbucks Barista machine's portafilter broke I decided to just take the plunge and get the Barista Express by Breville. It was sitting in my wish list for over a year. Wishing no more! This machine is great and I love that it grinds my beans and pulls my shots without me having to watch over that process!
It took me a few times to get the right pressure for my grind and pull but now that I have it figured out I get great shots each time!
I haven't made any hot beverages (since it's almost 100 degrees here!) so I haven't used the stream wand.
I think the only con I have is that the water tank is small. I feel like I fill it up every 3 days. But if that's the only thing I can find wrong it's not that big of an issue. Glad I made the investment."

Pros: Easy to clean, heats up quick, fairly easy to make good, quality coffee. Water reservoir is quite large and the drip tray has an amusing ""empty me"" flag that floats up.

Cons: None really that I can think of."
310,5.0,2018-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am usually not huge on writing reviews but since I had so much help as far as decision making goes from the reviews on this machine I thought I should return the favor. I've had this machine for close to 3 years now and not even once it gave me any problems, concerns, or issues. The double espressos I get from it on a daily basis is just as tasty and rich as the ones from Starbucks, using Starbucks coffee beans of course. It will take some try and error initially in order to get your grind size, coffee amount, and pressure to put on the grounded coffee in order to get the correct pressure - lots of variables. This also changes from coffee beans to coffee beans, if you constantly change your coffee beans these adjustments will also need to change in order to achieve the perfect pressure point for a great espresso. I actually like the challenge of working and tweaking these measurements from time to time. It's important to keep up with its cleaning cycles and proper maintenance. I ONLY use Distilled water so calcium does not build up inside the machine, it's not needed but just a personal preference. All in all, this was the best money I've spent in such a gadget and would recommend to anyone that loves a tasty, boldly and rich espresso."

Thank you Breville!"
316,5.0,2022-02-12, Black Sesame,"I love this machine! Granted, it has only been about a month since I have purchased this machine, but already I am regretting not buying it sooner.

I am an espresso snob who, prior to owning this machine, would spend a lot of money every day on multiple espressos from high quality coffee shops that knew how to pull shots. I had purchased a cheap $100 De'Longhi espresso machine years ago, and was greatly disappointed by the mild, watery taste of the espresso so I went back to buying it from the professionals with their high grade equipment.

Flash forward a couple of years and I wanted to buy another espresso machine to save money (and time) but I was worried about sacrificing too much quality. When I saw this Breville Barista Express, I read some reviews and decided to roll the dice...and boy and I glad I did!

One month in and here are the highlights:

PROS:
1) Easy to assemble
2) Easy to use
3) Everything is in one place: grinder and tamp are built in
4) Easy to maintain: a little sign appears when too much fluid is in the basin reservoir
5) Looks great in the kitchen!
6) Makes a really good espresso

CONS:
1) I haven't come across any yet!

I guess what some might wonder is: is the espresso as good as it is at a high end coffee shop that really knows how to pull shots?

And the answer is: of course not! Those machines run in the THOUSANDS of dollars. However, for the price of this machine, you will be able to conveniently pour yourself shots that are better than many coffee shops out there and save yourself some serious money in the long run.

If you love coffee, want to pull your own shots, and can't afford thousands on a serious machine...I STRONGLY recommend you buy the Breville BES870XL."
317,5.0,2022-04-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great investment if you love drinking espresso.

I first heard about this machine from a manager of mine, he raved about it. Then I saw an article saying this machine is pretty much the best bang for your buck espresso machine. Finally, I made a new friend and his girlfriend had one. I bought it the same day I was able to try it first hand.

Cons:
1. It can be messy if grinding for double shots or in general. --- To avoid this, I grind the amount for a single shot, tamp, then grind another single shot and tamp again. It comes out to a little more grind than a double shot grind but it creates less of a mess.
2. Some think it is too much work. --- In my perspective, this machine is fun and very easy to use. Coffee and Espresso brewing becomes a science when you take it seriously so do your research, there is plenty of videos on youtube to help.

Pros:
1. Milk foam steamer takes it to the next level
2. Great for making affogatos
3. Use fresh beans and everyone who tries it will say it is amazing (if you make it right)
4. Easy to use imo
5. Easy to clean (so far)
6. Pays itself off after making 200+ shots"

319,5.0,2018-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After watching 120 videos on youtube and wasting countless shots, and questioning what is sour vs what is acidic, I think this espresso brewer is not too bad. Go watch all the videos out there about how to dial the perfect shot, and how to maintain the machine, they are very helpful but keep in mind every coffee is different and everyone’s taste is different, you will get to master your own shot tweaked to your own taste.
Few things to consider here:
1- it is a bit loud if you live in a small place the person in the next room may wake up.
2-Updated here:
No, you do not need 20 mins, more like 2 mins at most, if you leave your portafilter with the coffee in there for 20 mins, the ground coffee will burn. sorry!
3- keep the steamer nozzle clean, because it will taste like burned crusted milk on your next shot.
4- your post-COVID friends' visit will def have a much better Espresso taste and something to talk about!
Good luck."
320,5.0,2021-04-13, Black Sesame,"Used to have a fussy Delonghi Magnifico that died after 3 years use. After doing without an espresso machine for a couple of years, I decided to splurge during the pandemic and took a chance on this Breville machine. This makes fantastic expresso, latte etc... very little hassle. I use the Lavazza beans consistently and am coming up on one year of use without issue. The porta filter works great. I don't run the portafilter through the dishwasher. Easy enough to wash by hand. We have used this daily for almost a year making at least 4 cups a day with quad shots. Cleaning and descaling takes some time but only very infrequently needed since I have no hard water. Would not hesitate to purchase again. Great price for the product!"
321,5.0,2022-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Still the best coffee I have ever had. Nothing taste better.
322,5.0,2022-04-04, Black Sesame,I've now had this machine 4yrs and it has been used far more than most owners well likely use it. Cleaning and maintenance are key. My only complaint would be that our you do leave it for any length of time without use it takes several cycles for the deals to condition to track proper pressure to pull the best shot. Yes there are better units out there but for the price this is hard to beat. I almost spent the extra at the time for the double boiler unit but honestly am glad I didn't. I almost always pull at least two (double) shots to make 2 cappuccinos at a time so the slight time saving isn't worth the price or counter space. If you're really that intense than you should look at a higher-end unit but anyway. Bang for the buck this unit is hard to beat and well worth it if you are going to use it regularly. If you are just needing occasional shots (ie not using daily) it's overkill and you'll likely never get it tuned to make what we've you're wanting.
323,4.0,2020-02-19, Black Sesame,"Drip-tray has a lot of sharp structures, with many nooks and crannies, making handwashing cumbersome. Not upgrading materials to dishwasher-rated is a surprising oversight for an otherwise well designed product. No complaints on the primary purpose of coffee making."
324,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am not an Espresso expert or even mildly experienced barista. But I have read hundreds of reviews for this and many other machines from the cheapest to some of the most expensive. I have traveled extensively and do know what great espresso taste like as well as crappie espresso taste like. Now my review:
Pros:
1) Delivered as promised in 2 days from Amazon with Prime
2) Box was in-tack and everything included functioned as designed
3) Instructions are clear and the machine operates as described in the instructions
4) Able to pull good shots day 1 after trail and error getting grind correct
5) Have been using for past week every morning and the shots taste great and are consistent

Cons:
1) Sometimes has slight plastic burning smell. Not sure if coming from grinder or somewhere else in unit but does not seem to effect operation
2) Grinder can be a little finicky. But once you get right grind with type of bean then it will usually hold well.
3) If you have to pull grinder apart for some reason, get your vacuum out to clean it up before reassembly
4) Goes trough water in reservoir fairly quick. Depending on how many shots pulled during morning, I sometimes have to refill every two days.
5) Noise can be a little irritating in the mornings when you are trying to be quiet and not wake everyone else.
6) Takes awhile to heat up milk with steam wand and wand does not go to bottom of my larger container used for multiple lattes

In short, it does what it says it will do and its consistent as long as you are consistent. Find the coffee(s) you like and get the grind settings right for each coffee. Be consistent on your tamps and heat the head by pulling a single shot empty before starting to pull your regular shots. Can't stress enough, you have to be consistent for the machine to be consistent.

Overall happy with purchase. Will see if its still working in 6 & 12 months from now."
325,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,At the begging it is a like complicate to learn how to make a good coffee but after a while it works pretty good
326,5.0,2021-01-24, Black Sesame,"It was everything I hoped for. This machine is beautifully made and makes a coffee better than I had in France and Spain. I had tried some friend's machines, ranging from high-end Italian made commercial equipment ($$$$) that was fully manual to a De'Longhi MAGNIFICA Fully automatic for about the same price, one-button machine (also a very good machine), and the Breville unit is right in between the two--but it is considered fully automatic. The construction is top-grade and the small surprises were: the magnetic nest the tamper fits into, the use of a filter in the water tank (plus spare), the hidden drawer for the cleaning equipment, the warming tray on top for my cup and the pop-up tab when the tray is filled and it's time to empty. It took me a few tries and adjustments to get everything just where I want it to be and that was easy to get from the instruction manual. The only improvements I can suggest are: offer a larger water reservoir and a better indicator when the water tank is getting low, but these are hardly show-stoppers.

P.S. I've tried only a few different sources of beans from various countries and settled on the Hawaiian Gold Reserve Kona Blend medium roast beans (Not the Kirkland) at COSTCO. Delicious, rich and creamy. Still plenty more to try. I have tried other beans (ie.e Starbucks, Columbian, Guatemalan, etc.) and had to fuss with the grinder settings as well as the conical burr grinder settings to achieve the perfect extraction. For the Kona, I set the grinder to ""5"" and leave the burr grinder at ""6"" I also find that when using a double, you are better off grinding a single, then tamp it, then hit another single instead of a double to begin with (less grind spill)."
327,5.0,2021-09-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I waffled over the decision to make such a large purchase for quite some time. Reading all reviews for various machines, I always came back to and ultimately decided on this machine. Admittedly I watched multiple videos to learn the basics. I had an issue with it reaching pressure during brewing but the amazing customer service at Breville walked me through the process and it was fixed immediately. Very responsive and helpful. Love my London Fog’s and oat latte’s whenever I want now. It is an investment but if you drink coffee drinks very often, it will pay for itself quickly."
328,5.0,2016-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is nothing I don't LOVE about this machine. I have two, one in each house. I tried getting by with just one, but I was spoiled. Nothing needs measured. The grind amount, tamping, one or two cups, water, milk when frothing (well just fill to the same location inside the cup). I make Americanos the majority of the time. But weekends are reserved for a relaxing latte, espresso or cappuccino. My kids live next door at each house and come over and make their own rather than going to Starbucks. I LOVE the coffee flavor. This machine can turn virtually any bean/roast into a cup of coffee with just the right temperature. Or make an espresso or a cappuccino. The oldest machine is 5 years old and has never had any issue. I keep up with the minor cleaning they require. Have had several other espresso machines in the past. None come close to this machine. It is perfect! Easy to use."
329,5.0,2022-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it! Love it! Love it!
My wife and I are die hard Starbucks fans. And I mean, every morning without fail. Triple Grande drinks. I've been searching and searching for a suitable alternative because Starbucks is expensive and I was growing tired of the inconsistent quality of my $7 coffee. I've tried a $150 Espresso Machine from Bed Bath and Beyond, I used it once... never again. I finally took a chance and went with Breville based on reviews and what we thought we wanted... and we are 100% satisfied. I find, this product is not an alternative to Starbucks, this is BETTER than starbucks. The Crema is like I've never had and the taste this machine produces, we will never turn back. For us, this product will pay for itself within 2 months by no longer going to Starbucks.

Not to mention, ifs a beautiful looking machine.

Manageable Cons:
It's a sophisticated machine and I wanted the best quality so I followed every step in the guide. It's a bit tedious at first, but once you sip that cup of coffee, it's all worth it. The clean up after each use is important to us as again we want to preserve quality, so it's not a simple brew and walk away. But for us, well worth it. I can see how it Can be a manageable con for some."
330,1.0,2021-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update 3/3/20 This machine has been inconsistent in everything. We asked for a replacement from Amazon and they refused. We went to return it, after they told us over the phone that we would get a full refund, only to find out they were going to charge a $100 stocking fee on a faulty machine. We decided to keep it and work with Breville to fix it. Now, there is absolutely no steam coming out of the wand. I called Breville again, only to learn that this ""new"" machine we bought from Amazon in October 2019 (less than five months ago and only out of the box since the end of November) was manufactured in 2011!!! Yes, you read that correctly. Amazon sold us a nine year old machine as new and now won't stand behind it. This is absolutely ridiculous. Who wants to be out $600??? DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE FROM AMAZON! Go through Breville if you want it.

Update 12/19/19 We are changing from three stars back down to one. This machine just doesn't produce enough pressure to make good espresso and then steam the milk. We've tried everything and any change that's made lasts a short while before it's not working again. My husband thinks there is no boiler in this machine - but rather it seems they use an instant hot water mechanism. This machine is going back. We get better results with our Mr. Coffee espresso machine that is several years old and was $40.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This was going to be a one-star review until this morning when we finally talked with Breville. I have been using the machine for a couple weeks (waited too long to open the box to return it). Before this purchase, I used an Estro Profi, which has lasted 26 years. It was an amazing machine, but was starting to leak, so my husband bought me this to replace it. It's still working well and we gave it to my nephew to continue using. I expected this machine to work the same or better - but it just doesn't. That said, after two weeks of using store ground coffee, I switched to beans and also switched to the non-dual filter, as instructed. There was absolutely zero pressure and the coffee was horrible. No crema, just black blech. There also wasn't enough pressure to steam the milk long enough to make it hot. I didn't want to tell my husband because I was afraid of hurting his feelings. When the machine completely tanked when I switched to beans, I had to tell him. We tried to contact Breville online, but realized our machine had no batch number, making registering also very frustrating. They promised to get back to us within 24 hours. They didn't. We called and they promised a call right back, and they didn't. Finally out of complete anger and frustration, we called again this morning and got a different message, and they did call back. They walked us through making a shot, told us how to reset to factory settings, and also (get this... this is a big deal...) had us switch back to the pressurized filter. Apparently, the other is only good for a certain type of coffee and used within two weeks of roasting. The directions didn't say that. They said to use the pressurized (double wall) filter with store bought grounds, and the single wall filter with beans being ground by the machine. When we made this change, it did work out better. I'm still not impressed with the machine however, since it's so finicky and definitely not the same quality as the one we let go. For this amount of money, I expect a heavy-duty machine that can steam 16 ounces of milk and will last at least 10 years. This is not it. It is okay - not great."
331,4.0,2022-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Good overall machine. hard to get help. Perhaps my experience can help someone. If you want to use single wall filters and you can't get pressure. I had to adjust burr grinder gap, (internally, not dial on side, manual shows how) to finest or #1. Once I had the coffee fine enough I was able to get proper pressure with the single wall filter. Each coffee is different so you have to find ""sweet spot"" with each kind. Yes, there is a learning process to using this machine. I was able to use the double wall filters with no internal adjustments at all. If you wish to keep it simple, I suggest using the double wall filters. Great machine either way."
332,5.0,2020-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased the Breville Barista Express after a couple of years of experience with a manual espresso maker.

1st. The built in grinder is a godsend. Speeds up the entire process coming from a manual conical burr grinder. I find the settings to be adequate to get the grind size you want. And fine tuning the dispensing volume wasnt too difficult either but it takes time to tune to your preference.

2nd, I've only had experience with the single wall baskets for the porta filter. Other than it being really difficult to remove once installed on the porta filter, it works as it should and locks in to the brew head without any fuss

3rd, brewing process with the PID control seems to work fine. And the single and double shot water volume measured to be more or less accurate: 30 ml for single, 60 ml for doubles

4th, getting good at frothing the milk took about a half a dozen attempts. You just need to get accustomed to the noise during the frothing process. Having the tube in the milk at just the right depth is the key though...

5th, cleaning isnt much of a problem and no more difficult than my manual espresso maker.

All in all, coming from a manual machine and manual grinder, this machine has provided an awesome experience so far. Time will tell the durability but I'm very pleased with the purchase so far."
333,2.0,2022-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"12/2/2018
Opened the box. I loved this espresso machine. For almost a month I had beautiful espresso drinks in the comfort of my home.

1/1/2019
The coffee bean grinder suddenly stopped grinding. The grinder is making a screeching noise. I shut the machine off and unplugged it. Followed the guide on page 26 to clean the grinder. No luck. Still broken.

Followed the guide to disassemble the grinder. (after buying a 10mm socket wrench). Cleaned and reassembled the grinder following the guide on page 26. Still no luck.

I'm very disappointed that this espresso machine broke so quickly after opening it. I'm going to contact Breville support to see if they will fix the machine for me. It's unfortunate because I've already spent time and money trying to fix something that should have lasted years without issues.

I will update this with Breville response.

1/4/2019
I called Breville and was on hold for about 40 minutes before a service member helped me out. She was very nice and after a few questions asked me to troubleshoot over the phone. As soon as she heard the noise my machine was making she told me they would do a product swap. I had the choice of sending back my machine first (they would provide shipping) or have them send the new machine and then return the old machine (with a security deposit on my cc). Since I still had the original box I opted for option one.

1/5/2019
Dropped the machine of at Fedex

1/9/2019
The package has arrived to Breville

1/15/2019
I got a notification I will receive the new machine on the 21st.

1/18/2019
The machine arrived early.

I've finally set it up. This machine sounds so much better than my first machine did. The only thing I thought was wrong with the first machine was the coffee grinder. However I'm beginning to suspect the whole unit was faulty.

This new machine makes less screeching and grinding noises than the first machine did. I've only pulled a few shots of espresso but all of these have been significantly better shots than the previous machine.

I'm leaving review at 1 star because I'm still very skeptical of the longevity of the machine. If this machine makes it more than a month I'll boost my rating but for now I'll leave it at 1 Star so people can see the negative sides to this machine"
334,5.0,2021-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought for my husband. He absolutely loves it! Great quality! He's absolutely enjoying making lattes. Couldn't be satisfied with this purchased!!
335,5.0,2022-05-19, Black Sesame,"This product is excellent! Great quality, attractive look, easy to clean, phenomenal grinding.
I look forward to my mornings to grind and brew fresh coffee beans thanks to Breville."
336,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"New using this machine. I find it easy to use. However, I must say that I am new with the Espresso machine. For a newbie I think the machine is perfect. I even like the manual aspect of it. I am not sure I want so much auto features. I enjoy the tampering and handling when making my espresso. If any kink, The cleaning part is my moaning. Easy nevertheless!
I must share, the quality of espresso and latte one can make with this wonderful machine is exceptionally great! The machine does its job gallantly. The quality of product is more related to the quality of coffee one use and level of expertise. The grinding of the bean, amount, tampering, ,milk frosting , are very important parts of the whole process. The are equally enjoyable, IMHO. At this point I have no negative to report. Once again I enjoy the hands on making a good espresso. For me in the grand en it comes to the quality of coffee bean used. I have tried a few different beans including the famous Colombians. I have better results from coffee blends than single origin. I am still in search of the holy bean. Quite elusive. I am trying to get hands on some of those expensive machines to compare the quality of espresso and so on. As far as I know I love my machine and would need be I would buy it again."
337,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Replaced my VERY expensive Starbucks habit. Before the pandemic lockdown, I’d hit a Starbucks drive-thru every single morning. Even weekends. Once the lockdown went into effect, I had major coffee withdrawals. I tried various drip coffee makers and french presses, but it wasn’t espresso. I finally bit the bullet and bought the Breville.

I’ve had it several months now, and I love it. My wife doesn’t drink coffee, but my teenage daughter and I love espresso drinks. I make hot caramel macchiatos, and my daughter makes both lattes and cold Frappuccinos. The machine is as easy as any espresso machine. Getting perfect shots takes a bit of practice, but that is more about my initial lack of skill than anything to do with the Breville.

The machine is loud, but I think all espresso machines are loud.

I was a little surprised at how fast we burn through a bag of coffee beans. I probably make 6-8 shots per day, and my daughter makes 2-4. We go through a bag of coffee every few days, it seems. I’m careful with the grinder, so I’m not wasting any due to spillage. Apparently espresso just needs a lot of beans."
338,3.0,2015-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am disappointed in this breville machine. I would have to brew 100's of espresso's before I can get it right. It is way more complicated than I thought and my boyfriend does not want to go through the whole learning process, he believes it should be a 1, 2, 3, process and unfortunately it is not. Apparently you have to be a pro at brewing coffee. I think I will be returning this."
339,5.0,2022-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We purchased this for our daughter and son-in-law for Christmas. [They wanted a Napresso machine and I was firmly against it because of the programmed obsolescence of the pods, horrible environmental waste and carcinogens of the plastics and aluminum options.] They watched the videos on this machine prior to my purchase and felt it was very manageable.
There was a learning curve to making the perfect cup - very important to use Espresso whole beans - not try to just use regular and change the grind and don't over-tamp the ground beans. The machine appears to divide the pressure when doing a double shot and the resulting cup doesn't provide the same punch but this is a consistent review of all the espresso machines from my research. This machine makes a long black or Americano to perfection! The residual grounds have been too moist to be used for additional cups but my darlings are ""obsessed"" with the machine and find it a small price to pay for perfect daily espresso. They even claimed during a camping weekend that they looked forward to getting home to their machine as they missed their daily treat. Although it doesn't froth the milk it does steam it - so if you need a ""cafe' con leche"" Spanish style, you can have it in moments! Easy to clean and a beautiful addition to your kitchen. Considering one for us!"
340,4.0,2019-02-01, Black Sesame,"TL;DR It's good but the steaming function takes over a minute and doesn't create a proper foam.

Overall, I really like this machine. The grind function is pretty consistent and seems sturdy. If the burrs wear down down the road, replacement seems fairly simple. The pressure gauge is helpful in adjusting your grind size when you put new beans through. Pulls a great tasting espresso, pretty close to the 2oz mark almost every time. It also has functionality that allows you to be able to adjust the temperature in 2 degree increments depending on the bean you decide to use.

My only beef is with the steam wand. To steam one batch of milk using the provided metal pitcher takes almost a minute and a half! If you are familiar with the steaming process, a slow heat like this with minimal steam force doesn't separate the proteins in the milk as effectively causing a less creamy, less foamy milk. Yea, I know, 1st world problems, but this machine was near $600. I had expected a better steam functionality for that.

Will I keep using it? Oh heck yea. It's changed my morning routine significantly for the better. Would still recommend, but keep the above in mind if you're a latte or cappuccino aficionado"
341,3.0,2021-02-28, Black Sesame,"Bought this to replace a 5 year old 870 for which replacement parts are unavailable. I am / was unhappy with Breville when I discovered that many parts are unavailable so one basically has to buy a new machine when the Breville breaks or pay a hefty price to send it somewhere for repair. I didn't want to purchase another Breville but I found that it would cost hundreds more to get another machine with the 870's capabilities. I make mainly lattes and americanos with the occasional cappuccino and I want easy control of the grind, tamp, and milk frothing. These can be done with the 870. The pros; quick warm up time, small footprint, allows / requires user control throughout the entire coffee drink making process, has both single and double wall filters, water tank level easily seen, pressure gauge, pucks that come out dry and easily release from the filter, and built in grinder. The cons; loud, steam wand is just okay with milk frothing being quite slow, only a 1 year warranty, and lack of replacement parts. The grinder on this new machine is much louder than my old one but the grinder controls work better. . Evidently Breville 's quality control is hit and miss. I've had no problem getting the grind correct with either. The repair parts issue and having no confidence that this machine will last very long persuaded me to purchase an extended warranty. For $700.00 I expect to be able to buy replacement parts and extend the life of a machine. Durability and espresso quality were issues with the 2 De'longhi machines that I've owned so Breville is the only option at this price point, with these features until another manufacturer steps in. This is only a 3 star machine until Breville addresses these issues."
342,5.0,2020-10-27, Black Sesame,"Had it for only 2 month and totally worth it
Its your fist step to professional coffee making and it works flawlessly
Built in grinder is amazingly good
Espresso can be adjusted to your flavor “ be prepared to waste some coffee beans till you get adjusted” it come with all the accessories you’ll need but its a good idea to buy a scale and thermometer
Downfalls, its kind of slow. Needs time to heat up and milk frothing also take time to reach desired temp. And dont forget its single boiler so you can Not brew coffee and steam milk at the same time"
343,5.0,2022-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This took about 2 weeks of getting used to, everything from grind to filter to even coffee beans. But once you get the hang of it, it’s an amazing machine that beats even the coffees at Starbucks."
344,5.0,2021-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I know that there are more expensive and higher quality espresso machines out there. My gf's 20 something dtr dropped a few thousand for one she picked up at Costco. I have been using a $99. deLongh , which takes up less space and makes a great espresso and froths better than most...I 've had to replace the deLongh about every 3 years when the leaking is nonstop (I used only filtered water with all of them.) This Breville espresso machine makes a good espresso and froths nicely. I doesn't leak and if you take a few minutes to read the manual it's easy to use. It does take a few uses to dial everything in, especially if you change the beans. IMO its easy to clean and maintain. I'm not ready to let other people in my house use it until I know that they have read the instructions and don't change my settings. I've only had this for a couple of months, but have made 2 - 3 espressos a day with it, so it's broken in, and I have a good routine with it."
345,4.0,2016-05-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought the same model about 10 years ago and it worked perfectly until the end. I decided to by this model based on my experience, and with one exception, it's the same reliable unit that makes an excellent espresso. That one exception is a bit of a pain as the want really seems to clog up, not at the tip which is easy to clean, but further up which is not as easy. I never had this problem with the original model. It's not a complete clog, but enough so that the frothing is not complete within one cycle. When I soak it and clean it, I'm good for a couple coffees then the same thing. I'm gonna take the entire wand off to hopefully take are of this, but I shouldn't have to do that with a new unit. Again, this machine is awesome, gives me enough flexibility to make what I want, and I only need to overcome this one thing. It's really 4 1/2 stars."
346,5.0,2021-02-27, Black Sesame,"I bought one for my home, one for my travel trailer, one for my friend's home (whom I visit) and one for my nephew. Then, a few years later, the one for my home needed service, so I bought another one for my home.

I have now bought 5 of these units...because they make really great cappuccino.

These machines last a lot of years of daily use, without any maintenance (other than daily cleaning).

I have owned many other cappuccino makers, since I have been drinking cappuccino every morning since 1992. These Breville Barista Express machines are the best.

The grinder is really terrific as well.

With all the easy-to-use adjustments, anybody can make a cappuccino exactly to their own taste.

While the machine is easy to clean, it needs cleaning every single time you use it, as do most (maybe all) cappuccino makers.

I think the machine looks great on my granite countertop."
347,5.0,2019-04-02, Black Sesame,"This machine is quite the surprise! The price is great and the coffee, once dialed in, is good enough for us!"
348,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This thing is phenomenal. That's all I have to say. Phenomenal.
349,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"It is well engineered coffeemaker and makes good coffee with tasty cream . Grinder works wary well.
One negative comment about manufacturer:
The covering metal grill has left sharp protruding edges after manufacturer pressed out holes."
350,5.0,2021-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am not an espresso expert but this machine has really impressed me. I have been using it on a daily basis for almost 3 months now. I have stopped going to DD and Starbucks almost completely. You do need to get to know your machine and will have to invest in other products to make your life easier. There is a review with tips and tricks that I completely agree. This is an investment but well worth it. If something happened to my machine I would but it again in a heartbeat.
351,5.0,2018-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am very pleased with this machine for many reasons. The combination of the Grinder with the storage for beans makes it so convenient and a no-mess expresso making situation. I really look forward to my morning shot when I wake up as the machine is such a joy to operate. The Steamer is excellent, and the expresso comes out with a good flavor and complexity. I used to have a capsule machine, and I wanted to do away with capsules for environmental reasons + have the ability to try many different types of local beans. They really put a lot of thought into the design and including all the right utensils with this machine. It's easy to clean. I would consider this machine a good value given the quality. It's important to note it's actually 15"" tall with the bean storage on top, which you'll want to have. I have mine right next to the sink which makes it easy from a cleaning perspective. I wouldn't put it under cabinets if that can be avoided, as that would make it hard to fill the water storage tank."
352,4.0,2021-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my flavored coffee, late, espresso, etc.. easy to set up, easy to clean. If you know how to make your favorite barista drink this machine will not disappoint. My Guage does not work letting me know when it's perfect temp but, it still works for me."
353,5.0,2016-08-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this machine as a birthday gift several months ago and I am LOVING it! I make 3-4 lattes and/or Americanos daily for my husband and me. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing, and several people said they stopped going to Starbucks, as the coffee they make is so delicious. I thought that was an exaggeration when I read it, but honestly, we have hardly gone to a coffee shop since buying it, as we are SO loving the coffee we make with it. I was worried that it would be too ""technical"" when I just want to get up and have a great cup of coffee. I am happy to say that there is just enough fiddling to make it fun, but not so much to slow me down too much in the morning. After watching a few YouTube videos, I think I've got the hang of making our perfect coffee and taking care of the machine properly. This little baby has definitely taken an edge off of the pandemic blues of working from home and sheltering in place! I would recommend it highly."
354,4.0,2021-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So to preface this I have been making coffee for a while and my girl friend is a manager of a coffee shop in Maui…anyways I could not get this machine to pull good or consistent shots for like 3 weeks until I finally asked my girl friend to come over and mess around with it to figure it out. The shots were pulling mostly around 15 seconds with the lowest grind setting (including changing the blades up top), all different tamp pressures, coffee mixes and Porto filters. Anyways she found out how to change the temperature of the water and it fixed everything but was such a pain in the butt!!!"
355,5.0,2022-05-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worth every penny! Best purchase I've made. Has already paid for itself. I haven't stopped at a shop for coffee since I bought it. Highly recommend this machine. Easy to use and pulls great shots!
356,5.0,2021-04-28, Black Sesame,"Fantastic machine. I bought this >3 years ago and still use it daily. Great burr grinder that still grinds perfectly, pressure gauge so you can adjust grind size and amount for a perfect cup of coffee. It's consistent if you don't change your coffee, but may have to readjust settings if you switch coffee varieties like I do.

Some tricks I've learned:
- There are many videos on YouTube on this machine, which is great because it's a quick way to remind myself how to do the cleaning function, for instance.
- I've set the grind amount to deliver 2 portions of coffee into the filter (1/2 at a time), tamping each part, instead of trying to fill in one go. It reduces the risk of spilling the grounds around.
- You may have to adjust the grind amount or size depending on the coffee that you buy, especially if the coffee is oilier. So if you see the grind amount is suddenly off, it may be the coffee differences causing it
- There are plenty of cleaning tablets and ion-exchange filters here on Amazon. They all see the same - don't buy the expensive ones"
357,4.0,2016-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,THE DELIVERY IS FAST AND I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
358,5.0,2022-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the first espresso machine we have owned. I chose it based on price, reviews, and videos I watched. You really do get professional quality results from it; I would much rather stay at home for coffee than pay $4+ for a less delicious latte at Starbucks. It was tricky at first to dial in the settings to figure out which grind and amount would be best, and tamping takes some practice, but we're experts now! I have given up on froth art, but I completely enjoy the layer of foam on my java. My husband also uses only the steam wand to froth milk to make tea lattes. I could imagine making steamers regularly if we had little kids. I love the way the extra supplies are stored in the unit itself; only the water filters need extra storage space. There is ample room on the top of the unit to keep a small cup for flushing out the grounds after each cup, and I just keep a big spoon rest next to the unit to store the single or double inserts and the portafilter. Only word of caution: I can't imagine putting it anywhere in the kitchen that is not next to the sink. It would be a pain to have to take the tank off the back each time it needed filled, and the tray on the bottom needs to emptied at least twice a week and I wash it at least once. Also, you need a damp cloth to wipe off the steam wand each time you use it, and you need a place to get rid of the coffee puck without dripping across the kitchen. All in all, requires a little more hands-on work than making a pot of coffee, but it takes about the same amount of time, and you end up with a delicious end product that makes you feel just a little bit spoiled every morning."

360,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine arrived a few days ago and I've made some attempts to figure it out. While the instruction manual advises you to 'purge' the machine by running a tank-full of water through it, the instructions on the Breville website and their proprietary Youtube do not include this advice. I find this inconsistency confusing. I did purge the machine and noticed that the steam wand not only spurts water initially (which apparently is normal) but when it's supposed to produce steam only, the steam is filled with water droplets. The only other espresso machine I've ever used is my 27 year old Krups from whose steam wand nary a water droplet ever emerged so I found this water issue alarming. I called the Breville customer service number where their recording informed me that they were not open. The recording did NOT say when they ARE open. Perplexing.
I haven't tried calling Breville since but went ahead and steamed some milk a few times. I'm used to my Krups which creates a mountain of foam which the Breville does not. I was concerned when the Breville steam wand didn't make the milk foam up very much. The Krups milk is very frothy, very bubbly whereas Breville foam has very tiny bubbles which I think is intentional because I remember reading something about micro bubbles in the manual. The milk does seem to be 'silkier,' which is also a word I think they use in the manual.
The machine arrived with everything intact except for the rubbery part of the steam wand. It has what appears to be a finger hole (?) on it which arrived cracked almost all the way through. Not too happy about this.
I'm going to call Breville to ask about the water droplets in the steam and if it is not normal I plan to exchange it for another one which, hopefully works properly and doesn't have a crack in the finger hole."
361,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great looking machine. It took some adjustment to understand the features and how to work/clean it, but once you get that down, this works like a charm. Does require a lot of water refilling and fiddling to find the right setting to grind your coffee, but otherwise this has been a great purchase and we are very pleased with the taste of our coffee."
362,4.0,2019-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"OK - I'm not one for leaving product reviews but I had an interesting experience and I wanted to share. The Basics - Amazon Rocks - customer service 5 Stars!! Breville Barista Express Rocks 5 stars! Breville customer service - Zero Point Zero. Got my machine 2 months ago and with just a little practice this machine makes Great espresso, americanos and cappuccinos. I am a coffee nut and I am telling you I'm impressed. On to the bad news. The coffee grinder, which works well (2 burr design with a hopper that keeps beans fresh) has a ""flaw"". It comes preset to number 5 on the grinding scale but its very easy to adjust from number 13 (coarse) to number 1 (very fine). I found number 4 or 5 to work very well. Nice fine coffee, good extraction and nice creme. Unfortunately the grinder dial is close to the front on the left hand side and over the course of 2 months and several family members and house guests and maybe even by moving the machine around here or there to clean up the occasional spill the grinder got turned down to 1 or 2. Well at that setting it seems, at least on my machine, the 2 Burrs were touching and ending up grinding themselves smooth to the point that no beans could be ground. Not to mention I probably drank some of those metal shavings!! So I called Breville, I was left on perma-hold on 3 different calls. Waited an hour on one call. They offer to call you back - nothing. Went online to buy new burr grinder parts and it seems they are back-ordered indefinitely. So that is when I called Amazon and they hooked me up with a new machine and a label to send the old one back. Great machine but be careful with that grinder!! THANKS AMAZON..."
363,5.0,2020-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What a great espresso machine. We had two Gaggia Classic for many years and a separate Gaggia Burr Grinder. My husband was in love with it and swore he would never switch. I had to work on it, my convincing point was that I could not deal anymore with the mess he would leave between the machine and the burr grinder after making his espresso. Finally, we are both happy. First with the ease of use, everything is in one place without sacrificing quality of each independent component. Even the milk wand does a better job then Gaggia milk wand. I also love that I can play with the exact extraction that I want and how to modify the grinder setting and the grinding amount to achieve my perfect cappuccino. We gave our daughter our not that old Gaggia and the grinder, but I just bought her Breville for her birthday. The whole family loves espresso and instead of going to buy Starbucks, which Btw I don’t really enjoy, I think in a long term we will be saving $$ while owning this machine. The only not that great thing is that I am noticing the price of this machine keeps rising. Here is to demand and supply, I guess."
364,5.0,2022-06-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you want to make really good espresso/cappuccino, you need good equipment. The Barista Express is a self contained espresso bar. It utilizes a good conical burr grinder and an excellent semi-automatic espresso machine all in one unit. My old setup, comprised of a separate grinder and espresso machine was okay, but always left quite a mess to clean up after making a couple of coffees. With this Breville model I have no coffee dust all over the counter after grinding the coffee. Brewing is as easy as touching a button. It is very easy to dial in your grind,dose and tamp because of the pressure gauge. I had it all set after pulling 3 shots. The unit has features found on much costlier machines. You can go full manual or automatic on both the grinder and the brew. You can swap out the bean hopper without spilling a single bean. It has both a professional steam wand (single hole) and a hot water dispenser, which enables you to make any coffee drink you like i/e machiato, capuccino, americano etc. I am finally getting the most out of my coffee with no hassles whatsoever. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone who loves coffee."
365,3.0,2022-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Ok so we got this and was excited about it but it’s turned out to be more aggression than it’s worth if I could return it I will . It cost so much to waste pounds of coffee to get inconsistent good espresso! If you read all the things you have to do for 2 oz of coffee it’s ridiculous. I was hoping to get away from the cost of espresso pods but it’s worse ! First you have to buy beans we’re do you start ? Buy a bag find out it sucks try another grind it up to get it right to find out nope ! Not it then fine one you like then try to get two cups the same . Weighing it to 16.5 g ? Timing it to be 23 seconds or it’s not good ! ? This has not been a fun experience hell I haven’t even got to the steamer part !! I have had it 2 weeks got maybe 3 cups worth drinking
366,5.0,2020-10-11, Black Sesame,"First some feedback about the espresso machine itself - this is an excellent and compact all-in-one machine. It packages a good quality grinder, espresso machine and steam wand all in one elegant and compact machine. It makes great coffee and looks great on the kitchen counter.

After one year of twice-daily use, and good maintenance I unfortunately had a malfunction with the machine. The steam wand / hot water function stopped working. I contacted Breville support online. They responded promptly, send me a shipping label and also covered UPS packaging costs, and completed the repair at no cost to me within 10 days (including back and forth shipping). This was all done without having to call them and wait on the hold line - everything was handled online, with clear and crisp communication. This customer support experience was EXCELLENT. I was thoroughly impressed and would give Breville more than 5 stars if I could for how they handled this repair."
367,5.0,2021-11-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wife wanted to get the best Espresso Machine for the home and I spent a long time looking for one and watching video reviews and more. I found that this one would work the best for us, wish it had the possibility to have an inline water supply - this would make it seriously the best ever! It allows you to set the grind from very coarse to very fine and also still the amount being dispensed. It has a setting for single and double yet allows you to customize the amount of coffee which is pressed through which will all depend on what coffee beans you are using, I would recommend a dry roasted since oiled beans will start to gum up the mill."
368,5.0,2022-03-21, Black Sesame,Very happy with purchase. Have been using a cheap espresso machine for ten years+ so have more than payed with savings for this machine. Only regrets is that did not buy sooner. So much better espresso. If working from home this is a no-brainer.
369,5.0,2021-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is an amazing all-in-one machine! Definitely has some learning curve but results are worth it - you get to drink amazing espresso drinks at home (don't forget to get good fresh beans).

Pros:
+ makes amazing espresso once you've dialed in the grinder (this has to be redone for different coffee beans, but level 5 is a good start) and got a hang of proper tamping technique (it's all about consistency) - built-in pressure gauge is very handy
+ comes with a built-in burr grinder and is compact
+ very good build quality and looks expensive
+ lets you steam milk to perfect micro foam which is great for latte art
+ easy cleaning

Cons:
- portafilter has very low walls which lead to very easy spillage of coffee grounds, since the proper dose heaps well above the top. You'll waste some coffee inevitably
- a funnel would help with the above but portafilter diameter is 54mm which has virtually no accessories on the market
- single boiler - you can't make espresso and steam milk at the same time, and ramping up steam takes time. Expect to spend 5+ min per cup of cappucino (12oz)
- steaming milk for 1 cup takes about a minute (compare that to about 10-20 sec it takes larger machines)
- (this is not a con for me but may be one for some) this is NOT an easy to operate ""press one button"" machine and requires quite a bit of practice to start getting good results - but the results will be much, much better than, say, a Nespresso machine or any one-button machines"
370,5.0,2022-06-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this as a gift for my husband who drinks a lot of coffee.
If we go out he normally orders espresso so this works out great. After you get it dailed in, no grinding messes, no carafe to clean, no complicated plastic filter holder to clean and no filters to buy and it's ready in seconds. Basically all the things I hate about coffee is removed besides the coffee itself.
The machine us actually pretty easy to use after you get used to it. After a while we figured out that I'm just a coffee snob. So yes, I finally started drinking espresso after avoiding it all my life.
The machine is pricey, but I think this is my favorite purchase right beneath my car starter just because of how well it works.
If you think of how often you'd like to go to your favorite coffee shop and the cost, this would pay off pretty quickly and you don't need to wait in line either."
371,5.0,2022-02-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Been using this for several months now and couldn't be happier. It took a bit of fiddling to figure out the right grind and quantity to get a good pressure, but once I got that right for my beans it's been smooth sailing. A couple of years ago I had given up espresso and just gone for the convenience of Keurig k-cups. Wow. I had forgotten what real coffee tastes like. There is simply no comparison (I guess that shouldn't be surprising). It's worth the extra few minutes every morning to get an Americano to savor vs. something with caffeine to get me out the door.

I've owned ""super-automatics"" that grind and tamp and discard all internally, and I was always disappointed with the lack of control over the espresso as well as the finicky, easily broken innards. Taking the brew group in and out was always worrisome as I was afraid of breaking something -- which eventually always happened. With this unit I get the convenience of the grinder on-board (and a GREAT grinder no less), but the rest of the unit is solid and low-tech so I'm expecting it to last a long time.

The steamer is really easy to use and, just as important, easy to clean. I'd avoided making lattes with previous machines because the steaming want was such a huge pain.

One caution. After working hard to get the grind setting just right (it is changed with the numbered wheel on the left side of the unit), I was cleaning the machine and when I ran my dishrag over the wheel it zipped to some new setting! Aaak! I hadn't made a mental note of the perfect setting I'd finally found so it took me a few times to get back to the right setting. So, when you're wiping the machine down, be careful not to undo the work you've done finding the perfect grind setting!"
372,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This review accounts for a) the initial quality of the breville we bought and b) the warranty you can add on through Amazon with purchase. We've had this machine for a year and half, going on two. It started leaking 3-6 months in. As it was gifted to my by my partner, I didn't think to even say anything - but just started using an insane amount of rags every morning to line the back of the machine. A year in, my partner found out and told me he got the warranty with his Amazon purchse. Great! We send it it once. They send it back and a week later, the leak was back. We send it in twice... and they sent it back, leaking, but this time because THEY cracked the water tray. Now they want us to send it back AGAIN bc THEY broke our machine!! Each time we go 3 weeks without coffee (hard with a newborn) and each time I curse Breville's name for the machine we bought that leaked.

When we are in the market again, I am hopeful one of Breville's competitors will have a machine in line with this one - as if it weren't for the leak, I'd sing Breville's praises.

UPDATE:
If like us, Breville sent you a LEAKY machine and IF like us you were hoping purchasing a 2 year warranty would PROTECT you... RUN, don't walk from this listing. We have sent the machine in a total of 4 times in 6 months. EAch time, the machine starts leaking 1-2 weeks later - their techs are apparently not capable of fixing leaky machines. 50% of the time they have sent our machine back IN WORSE CONDITION THAN WHEN WE SENT IT. Once they sent back a cracked water tray. (We bought a new one hoping not to send it in again..bc contrary to what the ppl in customer service think, we actually didn't want to send it back.) But... then it started leaking again, so we sent it in for a leak AND the cracked tray. We finally get it back, only to discover that they BROKE THE STEAMER KNOB off the machine - I now have to shove it into the machine every time I use it or it plops into my milk when I go to turn the wand off. We were under the impression that if we sent it in again, the fifth time, we'd be reimbursed. NOPE - You have to send it in FOUR TIMES for the SAME problem in order to get reimbursed a machine. Oh, but, even though THEY broke our machine (not once but twice)... we have to send it in again. This feels fraudulent. They shouldn't be allowed to NOT fix our machine and ON TOP OF THAT BREAK IT AND FORCE US TO SEND IT BACK. I BOUGHT THIS MACHINE TO USE NOT TO KEEP IT IN WHATEVER TECHNICIAN'S OFFICE YOU KEEP SENDING IT TO! STOP BREAKING OUR $500 machine and PUNISHING US FOR SENDING IT IN!!!!!!!!"
373,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought long long time ago, still working. So far It is working well. Flavor is not a problem. It does not alter coffee flavor, but it enhance more, family loves it. Very functional. Give your chance to familiarize yourself on the use of this product and you will love it."
374,5.0,2020-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,If coffee is a hobby for ya then splurge and buy this thing! buy quality beans from your local shop and have a blast learning how to dial in your espresso! No problems whatsoever and i’m about 3 months in.
375,5.0,2022-05-17, Black Sesame,Flavor is great Grinds beans very well I’ve only had a month but seems to be working well Made better than the last two I ordered Warmer on top works well Froths milk we’ll Price is comparable to other retailers
376,5.0,2022-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso machine. Has everything we need. Once you have set up all the settings for your specific coffee it is easy to use. But the hardest part is finding the sweet settings for a perfect shot of espresso.
377,5.0,2022-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this for my wife to replace having to go out everyday and get her a coffee (or two) from a local place. I laughed when she said that this purchase would end up saving us money. Well, as with many other things, she was right.
This machine is not rocket surgery; make sure there are beans in the hopper and there is water in the tank.

I read a number of reviews before purchase saying how this or that broke. I have had ZERO problems in 4 years. The difference? I do the maintenance religiously. Amazing how, when you take care of it the way the manufacturer says you should, you get the kind of life and quality they promise!
If you want to make coffees at home like the rest of the 'cool kids' then this machine will get you there.
I would not recommend this as a commercial product however. It is simply not designed for high volume and I wonder if it's lifespan would be dramatically shortened. Stay caffeinated my friend!"
378,5.0,2022-05-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this machine in Nov. 2016. It was expensive, but I promised to offset the cost by not frequenting Starbucks. I had a Gold Card. In that sense, the machine easily paid for itself the first year! We don't drink coffee throughout the day. Usually we have a cup each in the morning, sometimes an Espresso later, and more frequently a cup of tea (or hot chocolate), which you can easily and quickly make using the hot water dispenser. Making the coffee one cup at a time isn't a problem in our household. If you have a large family, or you're drinking 8-12 cups a day, this probably isn't for you. We love the machine and my wife built a little coffee bar around the Breville. You do have to clean it to keep it working. I empty and clean the tray once a week (5 minutes). You have to run a cleaning cycle and change the filter every two months (20 minutes). I descale it every six months (40 minutes). This isn't a device like an inexpensive Mr. Coffee that you can use and then trash when it stops working. We love it and would purchas it again."
379,5.0,2022-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my second Breville, same model. I guess when you design something right you don't need to keep changing it.

I was doomed when I bought the first one, because my wife announced she would never drink coffee from something else ever again. It gave us years of great daily service and then it started to leak badly. Obviously my wife would throat punch me if I considered a Mr. Coffee so I purchased another one.

It is a great machine, it grinds, brews espresso and provides hot water for Americanos. I never got into the Fu Fu drinks and don't use the frother, but it makes great coffee.

If you love coffee, buy good quality beans then you will not be disappointed in this machine. It is attractive and makes the best coffee I have ever had."
380,5.0,2018-06-11, Black Sesame,"This is the machine I’d been looking for when I bought, and blew through, 3 previous cheaper alternatives. I’ve had it for 14 months and have used it every morning I’ve been home to make cappuccino for my wife and myself. Including times when we’ve had guests (or seconds ourselves) I estimate I’ve pulled 700 double shots of espresso without a hitch.

If you follow directions, it’s a breeze to use. Just plan to spend 30-40 minutes the first time out to set it up and get familiar with its operation.

As long as you have the grind size and tamping amount correct (a trial and error process), it pulls a smooth, creamy shot every time. And the frother also works brilliantly once you learn the technique. The best ones I achieve are better than most coffee shops.

It’s expensive, but it has already more than paid for itself in our house. And the quality is so much better than the cheaper machines, I find it is worth the cost. Assuming it lasts much longer than the previous machines (which seemed to conk out after a year or so) it will be the best value and quality I’ve found.

If you are considering this machine and it’s within your budget (even if it’s a bit of a stretch) I highly recommend it."
381,5.0,2020-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I've had this machine for about a month now and I think it's wonderful. It does take a little skill and finesse to get the perfect espresso shot out of it, but when you do it is well worth the cost. I really appreciate the grinder built in, and the fact that it is a conical burr grinder. The steam wand is a little slow, I think it's steam isn't coming out in as much volume as I'm used to, but for the price of the machine, it's more than tolerable. The first machine I received did have a leak, but that was quickly remedied by amazon. This machine does have some cons, but they are not deal breakers, and are because of the price. The machine uses a thermocoil, and only has one. This means steam or espresso shot pulling must be done one at a time, not simultaneously. Also to steam, you have to wait for the coil to heat up. When on, the machine idles the coil temperature around the temperature for an espresso shot, so it has to heat up more for steam. All in all, it just equates to being a little slower, but that's to be expected with a personal espresso machine. One thing I will say I was not adequately prepared for was how LOUD this machine is. I did watch some video reviews, and they note the noise, but it does not prepare you for how loud it is in person! Steam wands are loud as should be expected, but the pump on this machine is monstrous! Still not a deal break, just mildly terrifying the first time you turn it on. I'll say this machine is definitely worth 5 stars. It makes beautiful delicious drinks (after some practice), it's very compact (for an espresso machine!), and is cost effective *for* an good espresso machine."
382,5.0,2022-05-26, Black Sesame,"This was my first real espresso machine and I absolutely love it. I’ve had it a month and a half now and use it everyday.

I will say that there are a few more things you will need to buy to use it/ make lift easier.

A stack of dish towels to keep the steam wand clean is a must. I just wet it and clean it. Also use it to wipe down the machine and the counter around it.

A coffee distributor is also a must. Trust me on this. When tamping i learned that getting the coffee completely even makes for a better shot. If one side is higher than the other the shot will be uneven.

A funnel is also great as it fits right on the basket and keep your coffee from falling out and it’s grinding.

And practice practice practice! Once you figure it out and get the right amount of coffee and the right grind, anything else just doesn’t taste good!

Overall I highly recommend!"
383,5.0,2021-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had it for over a week. I really can't use enough adjectives to describe the quality and well thought out features. I have been using a breville dual boiler at work for about two years. It doesn't have a built in grinder like this; we had to pay $200 for that. As far as I'm concerned, for the price, this is a steal! The double boiler at work takes over 7 minutes to warm up. This takes a about 30 seconds, wow!

Before I go too far: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. Even I tell myself I don't need to read them because I already know how to use a Breville. Apparently not true.

The grinder is capable of turning coffee into fine dust if you turn it up too far. The dial for coarse or fine grind is great. The dial for amount needs a smaller graduation between clicks. I sacrificed a half a pound of coffee fine tuning the settings; oh well, it's dialed in for the this roast until I change it. Each coffee roast will give you different results. If you switch beans a lot, you may want to write down the settings for coarseness and amount.

It is best that you practice with a bathroom scale when tamping. I have a tendency of over tamping. A+ for the magnetic tamper.

I've never used the razor before. Nice tool. The steamer wand is in a good position, easy to use, and easy to clean. The hot water dispenser is nice.

This machine makes a great espresso. Do yourself a favor, order the Lavazza coffee. It is creamy; it almost has a chocolate flavor.

Standing ovation to Breville!

Thank you for listening to my coffee snobbery."
384,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I must say that i was skeptical with purchasing a coffee machine at the expensive cost, but had to try it out. We love coffee and sometimes spend too much on it when going outside the house. This Breville machine is awesome. Not only does it make a great cup of espresso coffee, it froths the cream or milk (whichever you prefer) to finish off the perfect cup. One thing you would need to do is prcative a few times in making the coffee. It will take some time to get use to but not long at all. Easy to clean, just make sure you follow the directions. The grinder as with some horror stories will go bad they say, but i believe it may be several factors regarding that issue. Do not put too much in the grinder and use the right beans for it.
If you want a great espresso machine this would be well worth it."
385,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really like this machine.

Here are some tips that I can pass on to others.

When using the double-dose filter, fill it it two steps, using single-dose grinds and tamping down in between. Otherwise it's hard to get sufficient pressure with a fine grind.

Second tip: when making a cappuccino or latte, steam the milk first, then extract the coffee. Steaming the milk takes longer, and the coffee just sits there cooling if it is made first.

For a nice latte, order the 7.4-ounce JoyJolt cups, not the 5-ounce ones.

Use Miscela d'Oro Gran Crema coffee, which produces a wonderful nutty, smooth flavor. Just like in Italy. None of that harsh, aggressive Starbucks-style espresso for me.

Keep the machine clean. Empty the drawer after every use.

I'll close with a gripe. I find it nearly impossible to get the filter out of the holder. It's a super-tight fit. Can't understand why the designers couldn't figure out a way to avoid this because, otherwise, they did a great job. I use the blunt end of a can opener. Works, but it's a pain."
386,5.0,2021-10-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is a work of art, and easily the best espresso maker I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Don't be put off by the fact that it's not double boiler - it's fast to come up to temperature for both pulling shots and then switching to steam. Every little thing seems to have had a great deal of thought put into it during its design. The magnetic tamp holder is a brilliant nice little touch, and the tamp itself is probably better than anything you could buy separately. The water tank is large, well constructed, and has its own filtering mechanism. The tray is a three piece system that has a filter to catch coffee grounds and keep them separate from the drip water.

I've had this in daily use for over a month with absolutely no issues. I've tried a number of different beans in the grinder, and once you find the right median fineness, a click one way or the other is all it takes. The grind hopper is very well constructed and seals nicely, so you can just leave the beans in there.

The only thing that I can find wrong, and this is a stretch, is that the grinder on mine runs a little longer than I would like, even at minimum setting, and I spilled a lot of coffee early on. Then I discovered that you can stop the grind at anytime by pressing the grind button to the left of the dial, and that takes care of that.

The accessories included are all first class. All you need is a couple of shot glass or a wide cup for the pull.

Everything about this device screams quality, durability, attractiveness, and class. It is everything an espresso machine should be.

Oh. And makes GREAT espresso, too."
387,5.0,2022-05-31, Black Sesame,"it's about 4-5 months since I got this life-saver. Especially now during quarantine time in CA.

I am both tea and coffee person but I really need a cup of the GREAT (not just good) to start my day. In a hot season, I can frequently prepare overnight my home cold brew. I also have a Chemex. But my favorite kind of coffee is Gibraltar (cortado) and you need a perfect espresso and good frother to make it. I frequently work from home but had to visit local coffee shops just to get my morning Gibraltar and it was way too time-consuming (and expensive and distracting).

Don't be afraid to experiment - if you heard about ""dark espresso roast"" and that it's better for espresso - don't believe. I use light or light-medium roasts only and getting great results. Try different roasts and different brands - always buy the freshest possible roast.

Different beans and different roasts will all require change of the settings. Even switching from Single shot to Double will require new settings - I just stick with SIngle and make two Single shots if need Double, more consistent based on my experience."
388,5.0,2021-04-25, Black Sesame,"If you like your Starbucks, this allows you to do the some of the same coffee drinks at home. It's a little more complicated than your average coffee machine and takes a little longer to handcraft each drink, but man is it worth it. A different level of taste. It's not hard to learn, the instructions are easy to follow. The machine is well built and relatively easy to clean and maintain. It's sometimes a little finicky, but you just have to get to know it. (Actually it's probably more of a ""me"" thing than an ""it"" thing). I love to use this to make latte, cappuccino, or cafe Americano. It also makes a great espresso. You can choose single or double doses easily, with a push of a button, and switch from beans to pre-ground coffee by selecting the right type of filter. It's got a few more parts to wash and keep clean, but its a joy."
389,5.0,2022-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's not possible to exaggerate how much I love this machine. So gorgeous, so well designed, so well engineered, so well made. It works incredibly well and paid for itself in a matter of months."
390,4.0,2015-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is not a machine for you if you like to stumble out of bed and press one button. There are a lot of things to do, but when you get it right it makes a wonderful cup. Everything can be customized, from water temperature to grind to amount of coffee. Based on first 30 days over ownership, here are things I like: quality of coffee, nice design, relatively small footprint, easy clean, good instruction book (plus many videos available on line.). Here are things I don't like: not easy to switch from decaf to caf beans, some coffee waste when you tamp down, hard to change the filter basket back and forth for 1 or two shots; tricky to position small cup or cups below filter. BUT overall if you want to pretend to be a barrista and save money and trips to coffee shops, this is a very satisfactory machine."
391,5.0,2022-05-12, Black Sesame,"I don't want to double down on everything that has been said in other reviews, just a few things I found important to mention:

I used to buy those $100 machines to make coffee (mostly cappuccino) but was frustrated because no matter how hard you try, the espresso is always watery and you never get to this coffee shop taste. This machine is different and besides all those compliments for making awesome espresso and cappuccino, most of all I enjoy the real cappuccino taste for myself.

If you bought the machine and you are not getting the taste you expect, there are 3 important factors to make a good espresso: pressure, pressure and pressure. Watch the pressure gauge and make sure it stays within the ideal range (5-6 bar). Too high and your espresso tastes burnt (and you're not getting enough), too low and it tastes watery with no crema. Also, if you (like me) are more of a cappuccino drinker, make an espresso from time to time to get an idea about your performance.

A final thought on those comments about using this machine in a (semi-)professional setup: This is clearly a private use machine, made for some 20ish cups a day. You're not doing yourself a favor by putting it into an office. Get something with a maintenance plan and get hardware that is designed for this environment and capable of handling a higher load."
392,4.0,2018-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The instruction booklet tells you that during the cleaning cycle water will pour out of the spouts. This is not true. Instead, the water goes into the drip tray. Empty the tray after the cleaning cycle. Also, when you press the appropriate buttons to begin the cleaning cycle, it does not take 10 seconds as the booklet says. The cleaning process begins almost immediately. When the cleaning cycle is completed, three beeps sound, not five. Someone needs to update the instruction booklet."
393,5.0,2022-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this a couple of years ago and it has worked perfectly ever since! I researched for several weeks before deciding on this model. It does take a couple of tries to get the right grind and volume settings for the desired extraction pressure, but once set, no need to adjust again unless changing coffee types. Very easy to use and to keep clean. I am extremely happy with this purchase and have had no regrets. If you are looking for a quality espresso/cappuccino maker, at a reasonable price, this is what you have been looking for."
394,5.0,2021-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had our Breville Expresso Maker since the end of 2015, and it's still operating like new. It is not complicated (we are not barista-types, we just enjoy good espresso and cappuccino). For us, we are happy if we get good crema, and we NEVER have trouble with this, and if we get a good froth in the milk (this ALWAYS turns out perfectly). So, if you want don't want to deal with complicated features in order to make great espresso, this is for you. On the other hand, if you are a real Barista type, this machine is a reasonably priced unit that allows you to highly personalize the options. I would also like to strongly recommend the Breville company for their first-class service. We contacted them on one occasion when our machine made an unusual noise. Despite being well beyond the warrantee, the company immediately mailed a box for us to send the machine back. In less than a couple of weeks, we received our espresso maker and it has worked perfectly ever sense. We did not have to pay one cent for ANY of that, including mailing costs."
395,5.0,2020-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine is easy to use and comes with a lot of neat features to make a really good cup of espresso, along with other coffee drinks. The whole thing is heavy and sturdy enough, so it doesn't feel like it's going to slip off the counter. The burr grinder is particularly nice and you have the option of going manual or auto with it. It's not very good for making a coarse grind (for when I'm in the mood for plain old drip coffee), so I go with my cheapie blade coffee grinder for that. I haven't played much with the temperature and time settings, as the ones programmed for the single and double shots work well for my needs. Really, so long as you use quality espresso whole beans (I use homesteadcoffee.com) and clean, filtered water with the default settings, you're going to get a nice cup of espresso with the crema. The steam wand and the included steam cup works really well too. And the hot water dispenser is nice for when I want an Americano. Saves me from using my electric kettle. All in all wonderful product and highly recommend."
396,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The first six months or so the machine worked pretty much as expected, but within less than a year of mild use (one cup of coffee a day), the brewing programming functions have stopped working. Not even the presets; one has to manually stop the machine from brewing, regardless it is a single or a double shot. More recently, it stopped after 8 seconds, and had to start again, which ruins the coffee as it s begins with pre-infusion for a second time.

One annoying thing is that the grinder is inconsistent with respect to the amount of coffee produced, even though it is kept in the same settings. In addition, there is no way you can grind coffee for a double shot directly into the portafilter without creating a total mess. A specialized funnel is absolutely necessary, and it is inconceivable it is not included with this expensive machine."
397,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After years of buying cheap espresso machines that still left me running to my local coffee shop for a decent latte, I took the plunge and bought this machine. It took a few tries to get the tamping right. It was worth the investment. I only go to the coffee shop to visit every so often. The shots are delicious, milk is easy to froth. I am not waiting forever for machine to warm up. I just love it!"
398,4.0,2019-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The milk frothier worked nicely. Pulled a lot of bad espresso shots before I got it figured out.
Unfortunately my unit from the get go leaked water into the bottom tray, completely filled with water after each use. I wished to have it replaced since I put so much study into this machine but it was not available option. I'm concerned if I buy another one it will leak as well."
399,5.0,2021-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This thing lives up to the hype! Find the kind of intensely favorable, fresh, beans you like and throw them in the hopper. After a little adjustment for grind size and ""dose amount"" - the perfect amount will come out each time. The actual espresso pull mechanism looks and acts exactly as you would see at your local $18-per-cup coffee place just without a barista to spell your name wrong. The steamer attachment also works well and does the job. I literally have a cup (or two) of cafe quality coffee every morning now and it is even more gratifying than I though it would be. The only tiny room for improvement I can find is that it doesn't have a ""low water"" warning light so you have to keep remembering to look behind the machine to see what the water level is. Small price to pay for an amazingly delicious, dare I say bliss inducing?, coffee experience every day. Absolutely recommend this splurge!"
400,5.0,2019-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband bought me this as a Christmas gift in 2017. It has been used every day since and still works beautifully! We also have hard water and don’t clean it as regularly as we probably should. So handy and easy to use! My husband said the other day that when it decides to give out on us he would buy another one in the blink of an eye! I would definitely recommend spending a little extra to get the one with the grinder attached to it! Makes life much easier.
401,5.0,2019-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"use this everyday. going on 3 years. makes great espressos. liked it so much bought 1 for each of my adult children too. if you pay $5.50+ for a coffee every day at one of the coffee shops, at home it will cost you about 50 cents to make saving $35/week or $1820 per year! just as good if not better."
402,5.0,2022-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Definitely one of the best espresso machines available, the cost is a bit pricey, however you get what you pay for and indeed this one is the best bang for your buck. Make a Starbucks cafe in your kitchen, we absolutely love it and enjoy making all different types of coffee drinks. The built in coffee grinder and milk steamer is awesome and including the magnetic tamper is very convenient. Everything about this machine is perfection. You won’t be disappointed."
403,4.0,2022-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Heats up quickly, grinds wonderfully. Makes a proper espresso."
404,5.0,2019-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a great all-around espresso machine. With a grinder do you have all you need in one machine. This may not be a $5000 machine but for someone who is serious about making decent and good espressos here is your machine
405,5.0,2020-08-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have no experience with any other espresso machines, and I'm still learning how to transition from a regular black coffee pour-over guy to making espresso, cappuccino, and latte's. The first few latte's took a while...but after a week or two, they're quick and easy. Favor is excellent...every bit as good as what you'd get from your local coffee shop."
406,1.0,2022-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel," This was great for a while, then it came time to replace the gasket, as the old one had started to become stretched out and popped out from its seat.
I tried reinstalling the old gasket, then I tried new gaskets from amazon.
Those didn't work.
I tried new ones direct from Breville. Those popped out as well.
This thing is designed to wear out fast. The portafilter rubs against plastic threads that auger the portafilter against the gasket. This is just asking for trouble in the long run.
Its not a wear part that can be easily replaced so I'm going to start working on a warranty claim.

Update #1
The warranty claim process is a nightmare. Its going to be at least 2 weeks that I have no espresso machine. This is also BY FAR the most expensive coffee maker I have ever purchased, proving that you don't get what you pay for with a lot of companies. Definitely the first and last Breville product I'll ever purchase.
This thing is engineered to fail within a certain time frame, and you can't expect it to last after the plastic grouphead parts wear. They clearly were hoping to get it to last just past the warranty period then fail so that the purchaser would hopefully buy a new one at that point, but mine just failed a little ahead of schedule.
My old Klarstein espresso machine lasted 4 years on the original gasket and the grouphead parts were all aluminum, which isn't subject to fatigue at the temperatures these machines operate at, unlike this one with what appears to be GFR Nylon or something similar holding the portafilter against the sealing gasket.
Now I'm looking at this value engineering/planned obsolescence device that I intentionally purchased thinking repair parts would always be available, has me thinking to just go back to cheaper machines that aren't so painful to throw in the trash

Update August 26, the same exact failure mode happened again, with a leaking plastic group head, this time after 3 months instead of 4, so Breville had me wait for a 2 week turnaround again, and this time sent me a brand new in the box machine.
AND IT DOESN'T WORK.
The new machine turn on and makes all the sounds its supposed to, but no water comes out through the grouphead or the hot water valve, or the steam wand, so there is a defect in the pump or the piping inside the machine.
They've value engineered themselves into a hole, and I'm going to send it in for a warranty for a third time. Its insane how much money they are willing to lose in an effort to cut corners on quality. I'm really hoping to just get my money back and try something else at this point. Its pretty bad for them to charge $750 for a coffee maker than cant last more than a few months"
407,5.0,2020-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are a coffee fanatic, which I guess you are if you are looking into this expensive appliance, then I would definitely recommend it. It takes a couple of tries to dial in the grind setting and the pressure to be applied to the grinds to compact them. I would recommend using the same coffee every time until you feel comfortable and start to get consistent results. Then you can change the coffee. I use Puertorican coffee (Yaucono). We get really great crema and a smooth rich taste. Cleaning is fairly easy. I find myself cleaning it monthly with the recommended tabs plus I run a full tank of 50/50 water/vinegar solution just for good measure. I bought mine in 2017 and have not had any issues at all. On average, we make 3 double shots of espresso per day. That’s over 3,000 shots of coffee with 0 issues. During this same time period we have gone through 3 different Nespresso vertuoline machines. Yes, we drink a lot of coffee. It just shows how durable and reliable this machine has been for us."
408,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve used this espresso machine every day since it got it! I was a little worried that it would be overly complicated or would take too much time each morning but it’s been perfect
409,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As another reviewer said, this machine made me a coffee snob too! It took me a week to figure out the perfect settings for the two types of coffee beans I like. Once that was done, I have been making perfect espresso every time. It has become difficult for me to enjoy most coffee shop coffee unless I visit a high-end shop with a real barista.
I have tried the two types of portafilters and I prefer the single wall ones. The double wall filters take the guesswork out of pulling a shot without a lot of tweaking but they don't taste quite as a good as properly tweaked single wall.
This machine is excellent for small volume. Pulling three double shots in a row is about the maximum this machine can handle. The single boiler limits the ability of frothing milk and pulling two many shots in a row. However, I am extremely happy with this machine. I wish I had bought it years ago.
Make sure to perform regular maintenance, particularly descaling once a month to keep the machine at peak performance. The manufacturer recommends vinegar, but I prefer to use a product like dezcal, which leaves no peculiar taste.

2022 Update: I have now owned this machine for over 4 years. It is an indispensable part of my daily routine and a ""flat white"" coffee made with this machine is one of the highlights of my day. With proper maintainence and care it seems to perform as well as the day I bought it."
410,5.0,2020-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Having had this machine for 2 months now I am Quite pleased. I have made 80+ mocha lattes on it and have got the technique down pretty well. The machine is quite capable of producing café quality drinks with consistency. I use Counter Culture Decaf coffee & Silk unsweetened organic soymilk typically & 1% or skim occasionally. Latte art foam is more difficult with soymilk but can be done with practice. The Razor Tool supplied (AKA the Puck Trimmer) is an ingenious tool for consistency and I HIGHLY Recommend you use it!
1.Dose the coffee into the portafilter; it should have a small cone shape overfill on top around 1"" or so 2. Cup the portafilter with a free hand and gently tap on counter/tamp mat to collapse the excess coffee 3. Tamp with supplied Tamper ( 54mm ) & polish with a twist 4. Insert razor tool (hold tool level vertically) and turn it 1 full turn to trim excess coffee. 5. Dump excess coffee and Re Polish with a single light twist. 6. Insert portafilter into group head and brew. Another tip: Always run a single empty shot to warm the group head and purge the steam wand for 10 secs or so to warm the steam wand up Before frothing the milk.
Note: If you purge the group head frequently (Before& After use) the ""Clean Me"" light will come on more frequently so remember that. You can still use the unit if the light is on but remember to use a cleaning tablet after 30-40 drinks or so.
The machine Looks Nice and feels Solid and was Well Worth the Money in my opinion. Cheers.
Also check out the Breville Barista videos(Breville food thinkers) on youtube with Phil McKnight, they are Very Helpful with using this machine."
411,5.0,2021-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes amazing espresso and espresso based drinks. It is well worth the price tag for the quality it produces. Maintenance is fairly simple. It has a small footprint given all that it does, and it looks great in our kitchen."
412,3.0,2021-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine in October of 2018 and it worked great for about 6-8 weeks and then the grinder stopped working. Because it was under warranty they replaced it immediately and it worked just fine until 2 weeks after the warranty expired in early October. However, as I write this they have agreed, since the grinder has gone twice in 12.5 months, to send me a new one. So, from a perspective of their customer service they have done just fine. However, I have doubts, especially after reading the comments here about the long term use of the machine, especially the grinder. I wonder about design flaws in the grinder quite frankly. However, I will give it another shot.

Here are a few takeaways though:

1. I also have a DeLonghi burr grinder that has worked flawlessly for 5 years and I plane to have some pre-ground coffee available to somewhat limit the use of the grinder to try and extend its life. Making sure you have high quality espresso beans with no rocks in it or oily beans to clog it up will help also.
2. I gave up trying to call these folks...they either did not answer or stated I would preserve my place in the queue if I left my number....wrong, no calls back. So the best way is to email them.
3. The machine makes fabulous coffee and from that alone I would have given them 5 stars but have the grinder go out twice in 12 months takes my rating down to a 3.
4. It is possible that these integrated machines from anyone just do not work and the best thing to do is use a nice burr grinder and an espresso maker without the grinder built in.

So, I would suggest reading all these reviews and while one normally throws out some of them, be warned that the problems people have encountered are quite real."
413,4.0,2022-04-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I will preface this post with two things. First we just received this espresso maker a few days ago and have only been making coffee with it for a few days. Second, our previous coffee maker was a Super Automatic Jura Capresso Impressa E8. We purchased the Jura Capresso to reduce the amount of work it took to make a good coffee (grinding, tamping...etc)

The Breville makes great tasting coffee (we used Trader Joe's Cafe Pajaro Beans) and the milk frother does an excellent job frothing. It should be noted that the process of making a cup of coffee has several steps and requires you to wipe things down along the way. This is much different than our Jura Capresso which only required the push of a button for coffee. The reason we switch from our super automatic coffee maker is because the Jura coffee maker started having problems a year in (we had it for 5 years) and when we got it serviced the technician said that replacement parts were not available. Even though we cleaned and descaled the machine when required it would intermittently work. For the price, the Jura Capresso should have lasted for 10 years, in my opinion.

We decided on the Breville because we figured that the less mechanical parts the better. It takes more time to make a coffee but the results are more than satisfactory. I use almond milk, which doesn't froth very well in general. I can almost get my almond milk to the cow milk consistency. Nice!

The Breville looks great and has a small footprint on our already overcrowded counter. There is storage inside for the cleaning tools and on top for the tamper, razor and carafe. A very nice product. I would recommend it."
414,5.0,2021-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine for a few years now and I am completely satisfied with it. It is a bit on the expensive side but, if I had all the Starbucks I would get several times a week, it pays for itself. I wipe it every day and I clean the grinder outlet, the grouphead, the portafilter, and the removable trays every time I use it. It takes me all of 3 minutes to do it. I take care of it and so it should last for years."
415,5.0,2021-02-11, Black Sesame,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents, so while I can't write a 1st hand review of this product, I can tell you what I do know and what they say about it. My parents ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. My mom grew up in New Orleans with the french style coffee that is popular there and my father enjoys Italian styled coffee drinks like cappuccinos, and until now, they could only drink those things when they went out and were relegated to just having regular brewed coffee at the house. Now, with this machine, they can make any espresso based drinks and any amount or style of steamed or foamed milk. Cappuccino, Latte, Flat White, Americano... any drink that you can get at the coffee shop is now available at home. The first few days they had it I got enthusiastic picture texts of their latest creations and experiments and within half a week they were making the types of professional creations you would order in a cafe.
I stuck around Christmas morning while they unboxed it, and we were all very impressed with the build quality of the machine. The finish is also quite good. Everything is neatly laid out and clearly labeled. The brushed metal really pops with the glass pressure gauge in the center of the display, and all the components, such as the brew cup, tamper, and the milk frothing decanter are nicely built and match the rest of the equipment.
I have yet to be able to use it personally as I havent been back to visit since Christmas, but I keep hearing about the joy this espresso machine is bringing to my family, and hopefully it does the same for you."
416,5.0,2021-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this espresso machine. We have been watching this machine for awhile, it was hard for us to justify the price because lets be honest it makes coffee and the retail price is $700. When we saw it went on sale during the holidays we jumped on it right away. All that being said we love this thing so much if we had to do it again we would buy it at full price. We use this thing everyday, multiple times a day, it has everything you need and its addicting to use. We would go to Starbucks several times a week for our coffee fix. Now I can honestly say we have been once since we've purchased the espresso machine, and that was pretty much just to buy more beans. There are many choices out there for espresso machine's, once you learn how to use this one (learning curve is real) you can make anything. Love it!"
417,5.0,2022-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I dont know a whole lot about it as I got it for my wife but I have to say it kept her busy for a couple days learning how to use it and improve her method. I have to say, it makes the best cup I have ever had. She loves it and uses it daily. My sister recommended it and my sister is a coffee addict."
418,5.0,2022-05-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Don’t expect perfect expresso your first time. Read the instructions, then read them again. Forget the ‘quick start’ it leaves out far to much. Your best course of action is to dive in and figure out all the things you did wrong. Once you get it all figured out, it will make expresso of the highest quality. Make sure your beans are fresh. If you were able to afford this machine, you certainly can afford to splurge on higher quality coffee beans. The higher the quality & freshness of your beans the better the coffee. It’s really about getting the grind right. Don’t blame the machine for sub-standard performance, it’s undoubtedly user error. Do some research on Youtube also. Skip those useless, first timer, unboxing videos, find one by people who already know how to use it. Bottom line, don’t be intimidated, learn to master this beautiful machine and it will serve you well."
419,5.0,2022-04-04, Black Sesame,I got this as a Christmas present and I am in LOVE. I will never buy Dunkin or Starbucks coffee ever again. I don’t have to leave my house now. It brews the best espresso shots and I’m learning how to steam the milk better every day. It’s great quality for the price. It’s worth it. It’s saving us so much $
420,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,I love it and we use it everyday !
421,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a fantastic little machine. It produces excellent drinks with very little effects once you learn how to use it. Once younand your machine are dialed in it is very enjoyable to make and consume a wide variety to beverages. I should have bought it sooner!!
422,5.0,2022-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes great espresso. I have been using this every day since I purchased it.

I had some concerns that the grinder would dispense wildy uneven amounts of grounds each time based on complains from a friend who has the previous model. I have no such complaints. Seems to be about the same each time, and if you're OCD but don't care to measure beans with a scale each time - the ""razor"" tool to scrape away excess grounds is a workable solution. My friend seems to think that his got worse over time, so I will keep an eye out and update this review if anything changes.

The pressure gauge is a satisfying way to see how well the grinds were compressed (or if you're applying a lot of pressure, giving some indication that maybe you should use a finer grind).

Complaints:
* The pump is very loud.
* The steamer wand also is very loud. It really screams when you first submerge it in the cold milk. After it starts to foam it gets a little quieter.
* The water collection tray has a lot of nooks and crannies for seemingly no good reason, making it a little annoying to clean.
* The tool storage tray behind the water collection tray is supposed clip to the water collection tray so it pulls out with the first tray. However, the design is such that it barely rests on the edge and easily disconnects and remains way underneath the machine. Pretty shoddy design.

Summary:
Still a really great espresso machine and coffee grinder. I regret _nothing_."
423,5.0,2020-11-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this just over a year, hard used - daily; mainly for espresso (many shots a day) and the dedicated water spigot for Americanos for my wife. This is my fourth espresso machine; previously I had two middle to low end Krups, one Saeco, and now this Breville. Quickly and in a nut shell; this is a fantastic machine. Used semi-automatically, it allows me to adjust shots, account for different beans, and have some tinkering fun without having to go fully manual. The built-in grinder has been pretty flawless, super easy to adjust, and provides unparalleled freshness. All loose ends are tied up in this machine: filtered water, grinding, dedicated hot water, super easy steaming, and relatively simple cleaning and automated cleaning cycles. Again, for a fantastic machine most espresso people would spend the cash on as opposed to a multi-thousand dollar machine, it really is killer. I make many shots daily, unable to hide poor shots in steamed milk or other dillutants - it delivers daily. Absolutely worth the money."
424,5.0,2021-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We previously had a DeLonghi espresso machine (one step, whole beans in, coffee out), which was great. But after long use, it needed replacement. This (less costly) Breville differs substantially from the DeLonghi because it grinds beans into a stainless steel strainer basket (which is in a holder with a handle). You then tamp the grind down manually, then lock the holder under the pressure head and press a button. It takes a little trial and error to get the fineness of the grind, the grind volume, and the firmness of the tamping right, but afterwards it makes consistently great espresso. The machine is well designed and constructed. Because it dispenses ground coffee into a strainer that you must tamp down and move to the pressure head, there is some unavoidable mess of spilled grounds and drips of water. You could just live with that or mitigate it by catching the drips and spills. We wipe up and rinse the drain tray daily when we refill the water and bean containers. We make about 6-8 cups daily. Excellent for home use and possibly for a Bed & Breakfast. But probably not a good choice for a cafe or restaurant, where speed, frequent use, varied skill levels, and efficiency are considerations. We've not had the machine long enough to give a confident assessment of its durability, but no problems after a couple months of daily use."

426,5.0,2021-08-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've only had it for a few days, but so far I'm very very impressed. I'll update my review after a few months' usage.

(so far)
Pros: I've used many espresso machines before and I can honestly say that this machine is the easiest to use (I suffer from the common malady that plagues men on the verge of mid-life, that being a 'know-it-all' and yet I derived immense benefit from watching machine-specific YouTube tutorials). It took a little practice, but within a couple of days I was extractijg a great shot.

Cons: the basket is a little undersized and the tamper leaves plenty to be desired (the tamper feels like a toddler's play toy and not the genuine article).
___________
6mth update:
Most of what I've already said still stands true.

I've noticed that the machine loses some consistency over time but very little that affects the production of a great espresso shot.

The portafilter baskets tend to be less eager to firmly fasten in the portafilter so as one pulls the portafilter away from the head often the basket will linger behind.

Here's some advice on getting this machine to continue performing at a premium for as long as possible.

* always clean after use
- steam wand THOROUGHLY
- head of the machine (where the portafilter screws in to produce the shot). I always wipe thoroughly after each shot and then run water through to remove residual oils
- portafilter, especially pulling the abstention out and thoroughly rinsing after each usage.

* be prompt with responding to the machine's alerts to clean and descale.

Enjoy,"
427,5.0,2022-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I could not be happier with this machine! My husband and I are coffee addicts (me more so than him) and before I bought this we were buying coffees from a local coffee shop almost every day. That gets expensive after a while and the coffee wasn’t even consistently good. Sometimes we’d get one with perfect flavor and other times not so much. Since switching to this machine we have saved money in the long run, and get delicious coffee every time! I have made on average two 16-20 oz lattes every morning for the past almost 11 months and I have never had a problem (other than simple user error) with the machine. I even on occasion make many more in a day when we have gatherings at our house. Either way, this thing sees a lot of use. All my friends and family say I make the best coffee and it’s because of this amazing espresso machine (and really good beans too. We buy from Black Rifle Coffee Company). With just a little practice it’s very easy to use, the instructions in the manual are easy to understand as long as you maintain it and keep it clean, this thing will last you a long time. My one and only complaint (and it’s not even enough of an issue to affect the rating) is the steamer knob on the side is made of plastic and seems a little cheap. However, it has not failed me and still works great! Very great product, especially for the price!"
428,5.0,2020-11-08, Black Sesame,"This espresso machine makes great drinks, is easy to use and easy to clean. It takes a little getting used to at first when getting the grind size and pressure just right. Once you get that, it is smooth sailing."
429,5.0,2022-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it!
430,5.0,2015-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have been using this machine in an office for over a year, and it continues to reliably produce quality espresso without any issues. I am not a barista, but the quality of the machine seems to be very high. Consistently produces correct pressure. The features that caused me to buy the machine were the integrated ceramic grinder and the steam wand plus hot water supply. We don't use the steam wand often, but it is effective if you let it come up to pressure before steaming the milk. The grinder works flawlessly and there is good control on grind and on the pre-set dosing for either single or double shots. Easy to adjust if you use different coffee beans. The water reservoir is relatively easy to fill and has good capacity but you have to have some access to the back of the machine. The unit is very stable; doesn't slide around. If you drink a lot of cappuccino or other steamed milk coffees, you might want to consider their double boiler unit. With this unit you cannot draw a shot and steam milk at the same time. We use filtered water, so I can't speak to the descaling process. Normal flushing is straight forward. Would definitely order another Breville unit, and this one had just the right combination of features for use."
431,5.0,2022-05-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have waited years to get this machine, an espresso machine is not exactly a necessity even for a coffee snob like me. I saw the price drop on this unit and decided to take the plunge. I swore off sbux to justify my purchase. The first thing I noticed is my house feels more posh with this sitting on the counter (we have a small house in the country). Secondly, I decided I don't want another thing. Owing an espresso machine of this caliber makes ones life complete.
To the details... Italians make the best espresso! I bought this machine after many trips abroad to various regions of Europe. When you find the best you buy the best. This machine is top quality and makes a fantastic espresso (bean quality matters). I would say easy to use for most but I am extremely domestically challenged so I am having issues getting a cappuccino and as I am not someone that enjoys being in the kitchen I have have large learning curve.
My fiance usually makes the drinks and he had not problem adjusting. The fully automated features for single or double shoot make this idiot proof. The steamer works well if you know how to use it and clean up is easy as long as you clean the wand immediately after use.
If you want to stay out of coffee houses and save money, this is the way. Top quality, top espresso, very intuitive."
432,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"All those glowing reviews for this Breville? Believe them. My son recently stayed with me, and his Bezzera Magica ($1600) on the counter next to my Breville gave it a real test. And the Magica lost. But realize that even 'the Best' has a deficiency, or an improvement that could be made, so here are my observations.

One part was, in my estimation, poorly designed, and the design evidently persists to give forward compatibility. The latch grooves for the top of the burr grinder becomes too easily impacted with fine coffee grind. Breville suggests dismantling monthly for cleaning, and one should consider that directive in nature. I let mine go for a year, and no amount of force (I started small, and worked up) would release the grinder, prior to it snapping. Breville, to their great credit, replaced the part free, out of warranty. Perhaps they heard the pique in my voice.
I'd also prefer toggle levers on the hot water/steam feeds. Beyond that, some items that would add cost would also add an appreciable measure of improvement, like a boiler pressure gauge, etc. But at the end of the day, Breville still has a solid home run in this machine, if not a full grand slam.
Buy, and enjoy. I like the company enough that I'm going to buy their ludicrously overpriced toaster."

435,5.0,2021-11-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The barista express is made of high quality materials, and can make excellent shots with a few/several days of practice. Similar to others, I have found only the finest grind settings work. For light roasts, I basically use grind setting 0. For medium-dark roasts, setting 2. I have much more experience using the double shot, single wall basket, and it works well, but I can't say I have much trust in the other baskets. I haven't done an internal cleaning yet.

The milk frother actually took the longest to learn to use. It has its own learning curve, but maybe also some defects in that its spray is inconsistent. It will shut off or spray at a much lower rate periodically, so you have to time the frothing around that. You also have to ensure the knob is *completely* turned toward the spray icon. It's a little stiff, and easy to only turn it 90% of the way there, which is useless."

438,2.0,2020-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worked great for the first year we have had it. The motor seems to have lost power and it doesn’t gain pressure.

Totally worth the price to have my own perfect lattes at home, now this has made it difficult for me to order a latte just anywhere because I’ll be criticizing it because I like mine better in most occasions."
442,2.0,2022-03-09, Black Sesame,"Updated 26 April 2020:
So, having spent too long trying to get this thing to work the way it ""should"", I was not able to return it and instead developed ""workarounds"". Such as, to brew a double shot, set the ground amount relatively low, remove it, tamp it, and then re-insert it to add more grounds, then remove it and tamp it again. If I pay attention, I can make it ""work"" - though clearly it's not working effectively or as promised. HOWEVER - today just had a disaster.

Needed to add water. Removed the water tank, and carried it using the folding handle. Filled to the fill mark, and was carrying it back when the entire tank just fell off of the handle, hit the floor, and shattered. Frankly, that handle attachment (when looking at it now that it's removed) is simply insufficient to handle the weight of a full tank - filled to the very spec that Breville prints on the tank. Now the unit is a brick, and I have to wait to either pay for a new tank and wait, or figure out something else. There was water everywhere, and the tank is shattered to the point that it is absolutely not repairable. Very very very very very poor design. Never experienced anything like this before.

I purchased this and was quite excited to receive it. This is far from the first espresso machine I've owned. I followed the instructions implicitly and completely for setup and preparation. I used recently purchased (1 week) Lavazza Super Crema beans.

The problem is that right off the bat, I couldn't get the pressure gauge to get ANYWHERE near proper pressure. Setting the grind to 5 (as per starting recommendations) and the dose to ""middle"", the needle didn't really even go into the ""pre-infusion"" range. I probably experimented with at least 20 attempts. The closest I could get it was to turn the grind all the way down, and turn the dose up to where grounds were essentially falling off of the ports-filter. At that point, I finally got the gauge to show it getting barely into the ""Infusion"" range.

I emailed Breville support, but got no response. I called, waited for a while, and then finally did the ""call back"" thing. They called back 4 hours later, but obviously some people have jobs and don't stand in front of their Espresso machine all day long. They (Breville) effectively has no real evening or weekend support hours. Period. That person said that if the coffee beans were not roasted within the last 3 TO 5 DAYS (No, that's not a typo) then it may not correctly dose and infuse with the single wall filter. He said that this was the reason they provided dual wall filters. I pointed out that every single bit of documentation shows that the dual wall filters are intended for pre-ground coffee, and he (Thomas Mulero of Breville Support) hung up on me.

I am deeply disappointed in my experience with Breville."

444,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I researched espresso machines forever and finally bit the bullet and bought the Brevelle Barista Express. I've had it less than a week, but so far I'm in love. I live in the country, no nearby Starbucks, my go to at Starbucks is an iced white chocolate mocha (which is now over $7), and this machine can pull it off beautifully. I went back and forth between this and the Infuser, and the built in burr grinder did it for me. Through reading reviews, I learned that if either part of the machine needs repairs, then I have to send the whole thing in and I'll be without espresso machine & grinder, but personally I don't use one without the other, so that's fine. Also, less counter space taken up is a win. I haven't had it long at all, but this far I'm incredibly happy."
445,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this unit on Amazon looking to step up my home coffee game and I will say that the grinder and programmed espresso brewing are superb. The steam wand is an issue, but it may be that I am doing something wrong. I'll update later. But the pressure gauge does not move at all. That doesn't stop me from making very good espresso - though I wonder if it's a factor in the steam wand functioning. But for $700, there shouldn't be a damn thing that doesn't work right immediately. I've contacted support so we'll see what happens and I will come back to update. But so far, I am a bit disappointed and thinking about getting a refund."

447,5.0,2014-08-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This product was (and is) my first espresso machine, and I'm happy with the purchase. The machine definitely takes some getting used to if this is your first time brewing espresso, but once you get the hang of it it's fairly straightforward. There are a lot of resources online in regards to brewing espresso and frothing milk, and I would suggest checking those out either before or after purchasing to understand the ins and outs.

I've been using this machine about 2 months now and drinking cappuccinos and lattes daily. The one issue I've had personally with the machine is that it does not let you know when the water tank is low. This is caused me to start brewing an espresso shot when I did not have enough water, which meant I had to start over. This obviously can be solved by watching the water level. There are other more expensive machines out there, and some less expensive, but I think that this is a good starter machine for someone looking to get into brewing their own espresso shots and making coffee drinks."
448,5.0,2021-09-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Initial review: this espresso machine is great for the espresso enthusiast. My wife and I love espresso but haven't dabbled too greatly into the world of making it and wanted to try our hand at the craft. We opted for The Barista Express over other models mainly because of price considerations. A good conical burr grinder alone is $200 (though some decent ones can be bought for $90 supposedly) so The fact the machine comes with one built in is great right off the bat. In addition, the set comes with a tamper and frothing pitcher so anyone interested in getting into the world of making espresso needs only to bring the coffee.

There is always room to upgrade as other reviewers have pointed out- better tamper, a machine that can brew and froth at the same time, etc etc. That getting said, ~$500 for everything you need to get into quality home espresso production can't be beat. I spent a week researching doing cost comparisons, reading reviews, and weighing how much one should reasonably invest in something that produces coffee. Ultimately I ""settled"" on this and I'm glad I did. If you want to get into the world of espresso and know nothing about it you cannot go wrong with the Breville Barista Express."
449,3.0,2022-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So, machine is overall great, but I'll return it for a Delonghi because, after video calling Breville, explaining that I needed a spacer to lift my espresso cups in order for the coffee to brew in it, they told me that I need instead a taller cup?
I reiterated that I want to use standard espresso cups, not bigger ones, but they told me it's my problem and that their machines are all like this."
450,5.0,2022-03-21, Black Sesame,"My son recently moved to his own apartment. Unfortunately, he took his xbox and his espresso machine. I decided to replace the espresso machine immediately. This machine is better than his expensive one. I do not need to buy a grinder (it is included); I do not need to be an expert on grind/puck compression (this machine has a gage to tell me if I have made a mistake). Best of all, this machine purges itself after each cycle to ensure the mechanical workings are not left too hot (which would lead to early failure). I have only had the machine for a month but it is working as advertised. My son (a Barista for Starbucks in his former life) came to view the purchase. He helped me understand that the grind and amount of coffee are related to the acid taste of the shot (a finer grind [to a point] yields a smoother shot). The amount has to be adjusted to fit the grind you decide to use. The pressure of the tamp is the other control item to ensure a perfect shot. 35 pounds of pressure is suggested but the gage on the machine is a better indicator. It should be around the 11:00 position (I think even 12:00) to ensure the grounds are being surrounded by water and the extraction is perfect. The shot should take about 35 seconds to complete. Taste the test shots for smoothness until you get optimum results. New beans mean new settings."
451,5.0,2022-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Fabulous machine! Yes, I’m a total newbie, but I watched many helpful videos from Breville, other customers & YouTube presenters. After receiving my Breville just yesterday afternoon, I’ve managed to figure out how to get a great espresso! Lavazza Super Crema beans made fabulous espresso, not the bitter arabica I remember from some French cafés or even Starbucks. It’s worth its cost; it’s powerful, easy to maintain & stylish. Just so wonderfully designed to the last detail. love the plug! Easy to pull out without damaging the cord!"

454,2.0,2020-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When my Breville works properly (which isn't often - see below), the coffee can be very good. But when it doesn't work, it can be very frustrating.

For those considering switching from a Keurig machine, as I did, here are my thoughts.

I mainly got rid of my Keurig for three reasons: 1) I wanted to make better coffee; 2) I wanted to steam milk; and 3) I was nervous about BPA and whatever other chemicals may have been in the pods. I've used several gadgets to accomplish 1 and 2 with ok results but I wanted something all in one without as much waste and I was still nervous about #3.

First the advantages:
- I love having the grinder, brewer, and steamer all in one. I no longer have to clean my spice grinder every week. I don't use the steam that often, but this is the best feature in my opinion. It does its job well and the wand is easy to clean.
- I love that hot water dispenses from a separate spout than the coffee. I could never make tea in the Keurig because loose grounds from previous pods would come out. With the Breville, the hot water comes out crystal clear.
- There is less waste and I save the coffee grounds for my garden.
- The machine is just beautiful and makes great coffee drinks *when it's in a good mood* (see below for an explanation).

Now the disadvantages:
- There isn't a low water warning. The water tank is behind the machine as opposed to the side and seems to go through water more quickly than a Keurig so it's very easy to not realize the tank is low. The machine once kept trying to produce hot water even though the tank was empty. There should be a safety mechanism to prevent the machine from working when it doesn't have enough water.
- It is much messier. There is just no way around this. No matter how I try to contain the grounds, they get everywhere. I purchased a knock-box to contain the pucks and tiny spots of coffee sometimes spray the counter when emptying the portafilter.
- The water does not get hot enough in my opinion. I've raised the temperature and always warm the cup but it hasn't made a difference. I like my coffee HOT but it never achieves this. This was never a problem with the Keurig.
- As I said above, the machine goes through water like crazy. I have to empty/clean the bottom tray frequently.
- I wish it had a timer to come on in the morning, but it heats up pretty quickly so I can't complain too much about that.
- Now my major complaint. Perhaps my machine is malfunctioning because it is very temperamental. For the first two weeks or so, it worked like a dream. It hasn't worked properly since. I usually make two cups in a row: one for me and one for my husband. They both come out completely different. They will be either under- or over-extracted depending on how the machine feels that day. In the beginning it was usually over, now it's under. I use the same beans (freshly roasted from a local roaster), same amount of tamping pressure, grind size and amount, etc. and have tried running an empty filter between the shots to clear the machine but it still comes out completely different. And these are the same things that produced delicious cups in the beginning. I don't get it.
- The filter also constantly gets stuck in the machine so I have to lock and unlock the portafilter 2 or 3 times before the filter comes out.

I bought this machine because of the extremely high reviews but I guess I'm either doing something wrong or perhaps got a defective machine. I certainly knew that I'd lose some convenience switching from a Keurig, but I was not prepared for this. It takes way too long to make two acceptable cups of coffee that I only use it on weekends now and buy coffee during the week, costing me even more money."
455,5.0,2021-07-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have owned and used the Breville Barista Express for ten months and love it. We make between two and four cappuccinos’ daily and the machine has always delivered. The quality of espresso is as good or better than I have received in restaurants or coffee bars.

Your satisfaction with this machine depends upon your commitment to the details of picking the appropriate coffee bean for your taste, dialing in the grind, drawing a great espresso and perfecting your foaming technique. If all you want is a simple and easy cup of coffee in 20 seconds this machine is not for you, go to a Nespresso or Kuerig.

If you are interested in developing a moderate level of competency around quality home coffee making then this is the best moderate priced option on the market."
456,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I found it easy to use but I recommend watching a couple of you tube videos first on how to use this product effectively. The videos demonstrated some finer points that proved to be really helpful when I first started using this product.
457,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I waited a few weeks for this review because it took me that long to find the right roast, grind and dosage to really work properly. I finally found that nearly the maximum for a one cup dose gae me the proper dose for two cups. No matter how low I put the two cup dosage it was WAY too much. I then had to play with the grind in order to get the pressure into the middle of the black for good espresso. My present grind is set at 7.2. As I roast my own it also took a bit of play to find a roast that worked for us in this machine. The combination now works great, but it took me three weeks to find it. That is why I gave the 'easy to use' only four stars. Bottom line - you have to play with it a lot in order to find something that works for you. When you finally get there, it is spectacular. My only real gripe is the cost of replacement parts. $54.00 for the two cup carrier??????? This thing should cost maybe $5.00. Don't know what the bit is there."
458,5.0,2019-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We are going on 6 months with this machine. It replaced a 10-year old DeLonghi machine, and we really didn't know what we were missing. We went from ""meh"" to ""wow"" when we changed. Granted, we paid quite a bit more for the Breville machine, but having fresh ground espresso every morning is wonderful. The grinder on the machine is perfect, and the pressure gauge is always an accurate indicator of how the espresso will turn out. Clean up is super quick, and IMHO the machine looks great. It does take a bit more counter space, but we made it work.

My wife uses this machine every single day and loves the results. I'm good for every other day. In the 6 months, we've done two descaling and a clean cycle. Super easy to know when it's needed - an indicator light on the machine lets you know - and the process is pretty clear. Maybe not simple, but clear. Regular maintenance - adding water and grinds - is easy though.

Bottom line is, if you're looking for a great home espresso machine where you can grind your own beans that won't break the bank, this machine fits the bill perfectly. Endurance is the only unknown, but we're fully satisfied and highly recommend it."
459,5.0,2016-03-01, Black Sesame,"For espresso people, people who like strong espresso you will love this machine. It is quick to heat up and delivers a smooth and strong espresso. I am addicted to Starbucks and buy my beans from them and use this to make my perfect espresso. There definitely is a difference when beans are freshly ground. Strongly recommend this machine."
460,5.0,2020-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I knew what I was getting because we have one at work. I live this machine, It didn't take long to get it dialed in."
461,5.0,2014-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What can I say about this machine? It is freaking awesome. So far the best semi-automatic espresso machine. I owned 3 other fully automatic machines and I had to return them because I was not pleased with performance. I had a Saeco moltio and the frother stopped working the first week. Then it was DeLonghi ECAM22110SB and I had to manually help with the beans in order for the machine to grind it. Really? $900 and I had to push the beans. No way. Then the Saeco Exprelia EVO, this is just too much maintenance for a fully automatic. I had to add water constantly. All previous machines did not froth the milk like the Breville barista. This is the cheapest machine but the one I like the most.

Yes, it is true that it will make a little mess grinding the coffee. I remedied that by putting a container underneath the portafilter and problem solved. I make excellent cappuccino, latte, americano, and macchiato. The water tank is huge.

I use Lavazza Gran Filtro Dark Roast, 4 grind setting and I raised the temperature of the coffee by 4 degrees. It is the best machine out of the 4 I owned. I highly recommended it if you are not a 'one touch"" machine. I tried one touch machines but the drinks I make with the Breville barista is much better. This is the second week of owning it and there is no looking back."
462,5.0,2021-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Im still learning how to use it, how to froth the milk and the ins and outs but this machines has made that learning curve easier. Really loving it. Could use some improvements if you compare it with some of the more expensive ones but for the price this is it!"
463,4.0,2019-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine so far. Amazing design, looks good, and seems well made. The microfilter had a great weight to it and the grinder works like a charm. The buttons have a nice solid but soft feel to them. The right side knob is a little tight but still turns good. The grinder is very messy (downside) but if you had a separate one, there would still be a mess. I gave 4 stars because the machine it terrific but I don't know how it will hold up. I will update in a few months. A proper pull also takes a few times to get down. It's taken me 4 or 5 trys to get a consistent pull. The steamer also has a very good pressure. Inserting the filter feels good with a nice tight turn. Puck does come out a little wet but fairly dry. Not dripping wet. If you buy this machine I would recommend buying a knockbox. You will definitely need one. You don't want to dent your filter trying to empty it (it's solid so you probably won't but it keeps it nice Nonetheless). I would also reccomend buying a tamping mat for the same reason. It's also kinda loud. Not extremely or excessively but still has a motor sound. Lastly, this machine is not small. It's bigger than a fullsized Keurig in length, width and slightly in height so make sure you want this semi-monster on your counter. It is beautiful tho and will probably be the focal point of your kitchen if you do buy it."
464,5.0,2016-04-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this Breville several months back and wanted to get comfortable with it before posting a review. We were coming off a 9 year old FrancisFrancis (from Illy) unit that started shooting sparks out the front so knew we needed to upgrade so if you're reading this you also are doing your homework. This unit pulls a beautiful shot once you get it dialed in--that said don't open this box up and dump your expensive Kona beans in it as you'll need to tweak the grind, etc. to get the right pressures (I burned thru 12 oz before getting it right) I'd suggest going out and buying some inexpensive beans until you get comfortable with it as the grind for this machine is really important. Another thing that is important is the tamping pressure so I don't use the one that came with the machine but purchased a calibrated coffee tamper that 'clicks' when you hit 30psi--consistency is key. I know some reviews don't like the grinder in the same unit (like a VCR/DVD combo player) but to me it's just one less thing cluttering up the countertop. Love this machine! You need this unit, buy it now."
465,5.0,2020-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are looking for a smooth cappuccino, latte, espresso, tea latte, or any flavor of steamer; this is the perfect machine! It has every tool to help you be the perfect barista in your own home. I owned one prior and with the amount of coffee my entire family goes through in a day (almost 24 cups) my old machine lasted me over 10 years. When my old Breville finally seen it’s last days I purchased a regular espresso machine which didn’t even make it 3 months in my home. With the regular espresso machine the coffee was harsh and bitter—-so I had to buy another Breville. I saw that Amazon had one labeled used-acceptable condition for about half the price therefore, I snapped it up! When it arrived I was so surprised why it was listed as such! It looked brand new. Only flaw was a tiny hairline scratch on the tray. My family and I are now having smooth delicious coffee again without the high price of Starbucks!"
466,5.0,2021-04-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I see that others have had problems with the machine failing prematurely. I have used mine, on average, once every two days for 2.5 years without problems. I have also never let the machine run out of water or coffee beans. Doing either one will damage the machine. Check the levels of both before using.

Do not expect to know how to work this machine right out of the box - or after 1 hour of tinkering - or even after a day of tinkering. Yes, this is a consumer-rated espresso machine, but it is not plug-and-play and still requires a trained operator for multiple functions. You can become that trained operator in time, as long as you don't break it first.

Personally, I am thankful for having purchased this machine and having learned to use it. I found the convenience of making espresso inside my home to be greater than expected. On the flip side, I am now addicted to caffeine."
467,5.0,2022-03-21, Black Sesame,"To be fair, my Gaggia Platinum Vision has served me well and provided the fully automatic experience that was nice to have at times. However, it now no longer works and I wanted an espresso machine that was more interactive where I could control the elements that lead to great espresso, more sturdy(less plastic) and more reliable. I drink my double espresso ""straight up"", that is, with no milk or sugar. So I am very picky as to the quality of the pure espresso. I long for the quality espresso that is easy to find in many parts of Europe, but difficult here in the US so a home machine like this is a must for me. I have had the machine only for one week now, and have managed 15-20 shots using mostly the single wall filter. The quality of the espresso is excellent, exactly what I expected with lots of crema and not bitter. I used a medium roast coffee not really designed for espresso. Once I try other coffee choices I will do a longer term review including the overall machine performance, cleaning, etc. In summary, there is not much I can add to the other reviews other than so far this machine is perfect for my needs and highly recommended!"
468,4.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"This machine has been a blast to use and learn from! Here are some of the cons I've noticed:
-the drip tray needs to be cleaned often (not difficult just tedious at times)
-water tray needs to be refilled about every ten drinks
- The angle to steam is best at the side so it is a little weird depending on your set up to steam from the front of the machine

But, here are my pros:
-Easy to learn how to effectively get a good shot of espresso
-clean consistent grinds
-versatility off the charts (americano, lattes, straight espresso, using the hot water feature on ramen because i spent all my money on this, possibilities are endless)
-It is an easy machine to get good at being a barista
-Magnetic tamp is awesome location to store it

Great product! I will be using it for years and eventually it will pay off... ... right?"
469,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Produces incredible espresso. Steams milk very well. Easy to use overall. Loving it!
470,5.0,2021-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am amending my review from earlier this am… now that I’ve had a warm, frothy cup of espresso I’m not so upset…
There is a tool included with the machine for cleaning the small opening on the wand… (eureka)! I feel like an idiot, I should have known this.. However, still would have been nice to have customer service help earlier this morning.
My apologies to Breville for the earlier review. 😩"
471,5.0,2019-06-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a fantastic machine. Other more expensive models may produce better espressos if you're really picky, but for a regular user like myself, the end-result here does very nicely. The big issue is every day practicality. First, having the grinder together with your espresso maker simply saves space on the kitchen table, which for many is in short supply. I'm sure the grinder is not the best in the market but it does a good job and I find the settings for the desired grind perfectly adequate. Second, the design is concise, neat and well thought out. I find the drip tray and the grinder easy to clean and the water tank is sizeable. The milk frother works wonderfully and with a little practice is a breeze to use (and less ""urgent"" compared to more professional machines). All the tools can be stored inside the machine instead of losing them in kitchen drawers. The pressure gauge is a nifty help to get your grind and tampering exactly as you want it and to build consistency.Finally, the build quality feels top class relative to a lot of kitchen equipment out there (I find this generally to be the case with Breville), although I've only had the machine for less than a year.

In short, I use this routinely to make two lattes every morning and believe the quality to be better than what you get in a Starbucks or most cafes. Those really serious about their espresso, with no lack of kitchen space and a will to splurge may perhaps look for something more professional."
472,3.0,2021-09-20, Black Sesame,"I just received and am unpacking. As picture show, my portafilter has red marked and there is little dot there. It seems like it was evaluated as a DEFECTED from factory and somehow packed."
473,3.0,2021-11-26, Black Sesame,"The item was advertised and sold as new, but when it arrived, a sticker on the outside of the box suggested it was used / refurbished. The gauge on the front that measures the infusion / espresso brewing level never hits the ""espresso"" range. The wand can very easily suck the milk back into it and get gummed up (this can happen with any machine) but even the first use took longer than expected to stream the milk. So long the espresso had practically cooled off before I could mix it together. Not bad for iced drinks, but definitely not at the caliber I was expecting to gift at Christmas."
474,5.0,2020-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s for my house and it’s a great unit.
475,5.0,2020-05-19, Black Sesame,"My only problem has nothing to do with the coffee maker itself. How do I go back to coffee house bitterness now that I have tasted Breville perfection. Can coffee taste better than this? If so, I'm not sure I'll want to drink it. The espresso I am extracting from this machine tastes absolutely fabulous to my inexperienced taste buds. I have had espresso shots in Italy, cappuccinos from England, Germany & US, lattes from Starbucks, and numerous airports in between. I have used Keurig and the Ninja coffee bar but this is the best coffee I've experienced to date. Fresh ground coffee and good water (not tap) extracted at the right pressure and temp makes the difference. Thank you Breville for my espresso experience.

Update: 3/28/17
This is still the best espresso in town (my biased opinion). Espresso making is an art. With that said, there is a lot to learn when working with different beans. The size of the bean requires adjustment of grind size in this case one size does not fit all. Not complaining because I actually like the challenge especially when I am rewarded with great tasting Americanos, Lattes and Cappuccinos. The machine is holding up pretty well and the cleaning process is pretty easy however I still keep the manual handy when cleaning is required. I think I want to trade up to the BES980XL but that will take a while to convince my other half."
476,4.0,2021-12-27, Black Sesame,"This is my third espresso machine in the last 15-17 years. Except for the part about figuring out the extraction pressure, I think this is the better of the 3 machines. The Saeco Incante was fully automatic with a built in bean grinder and was nice but very loud. The illy Francis! Model X1 iperEspresso was not automatic, looked cool and retro but the paint chipped and the machine only lasted about a year and a half. I did not think it made very good espresso.

As for this machine, I really like how easy the buttons are to use. Also the way the beans are ground right into the portafilter basket. It took me about 15-20 shots or so to get the extraction pressure to register in the correct range on the gauge (with the single shot filter...still having issues with the double shot filter). I read a few other reviews and tried what one had suggested on filling the filter and then tapping it a few times and then adding additional grounds to the filter and then tamping. This is how I was FINALLY able to get the pressure right. What I have been doing is to put the grinds just barely over the top of the filter. Then tap on a towel on the counterabout 5-6 times. Then add additional beans to just over the top again. Then tamp.....Hope this helps anyone else having the pressure problem. Oh yeah, I also have to grind the beans on #2.

I also like that the machine heats up quickly :)"
477,2.0,2022-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When I first got this, I was ecstatic... literally in espresso heaven! Everything was so slick and the crema was just perfect. I had worked mostly with my basic moka pots for years and had enjoyed a couple of lower-end machines. I was looking for real crema vs. steamed strong coffee (which, don't get me wrong, is delicious... but it was time.) So, I read and I researched. I finally pulled the trigger for this machine and found myself looking forward to getting up in the morning! No joke. I couldn't believe it myself.
One morning, around the five and a half week mark, the grinder switch didn't work. No sound, no click, nothing. No ground coffee. Fortunately, I had another burr grinder and got my coffee.
I set out to clean the Breville grinder so it would work again. It didn't. I followed instructions, watched YouTubes and even had a pro barista friend (shop owner and roaster) talk me through some possibilities. I thought I had it but still no grinding going on. The next day, it worked. OK. I figured something had been done correctly and now we were fixed. Two days later, no grinding.
It was on and off for several days before it conked completely. Then, the unthinkable happened and the coffee was no longer crema. The machine stopped reaching the necessary bars to make espresso, so I was drinking, as my barista friends dubbed it, ""dirt water."" I was diligent with the grind, making sure to tamp the espresso for crema but still just dirt water. I had my friend grind me some espresso in his Rancilio and still didn't get espresso crema.
So, I went back to my moka pots and started the return process on this. I fully believe this was a fluke. I can't imagine that this is something that happens often because the reviews are too good, so I'm writing this off but thought it was important to share.
I have replaced this with a semi-auto Gaggia Classic Pro. It has no grinder and nothing fancy (so less to go wrong, I theorized) and, so far, I think I made a good choice!
If you get this Breville, I hope it works out for you."
478,5.0,2021-10-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I did a lot of research before deciding on which machine to purchase and this one kept popping back up in different places. I actually found a youtube video that showed someone using the machine and was sold. I spent a few years as a barista and a quality machine was important to me as well as one that didn't break the bank. I like that this machine has the grinder built in as they can be expensive for a good one and fresh ground beans do make a difference. This machine pulls quality shots and I love that you have control of dosage and grind. You can also program the size shots you want which is nice. The tamp is a little light and cheap feeling, but works as well as you would need it to. The pressure gauge is helpful as well - my boyfriend who has never pulled espresso shots before was able to use that to judge if he needed to make adjustments to what he was doing or not. It is only a heat block in the machine so pulling shots and steaming milk at the same time is out of the question and the steam pressure is good, but still a little slow. Its a pretty easy to clean machine and I like that there is a storage compartment below for the cleaning stuff. We've had it for over a year now and its still going strong. It seems to be a favorite of some of the restaurants in my area as well as I've seen it in a few now."
479,5.0,2021-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have had this machine almost 1 year and it is amaze-balls. I'm picky about the quality of my latte and went off Starbucks about 10 years ago. I travel a lot and hate coming home from Europe or Australia to crappy coffee. Well, now the coffee I make at home is better than what I can get abroad. There is a learning curve as making good coffee is more art than science. You'll need to get a good whole bean (to be fair, Starbucks Cafe Verona is not bad. I live in DFW and use Eiland Espresso Delicato or something from Third Coast from Austin, which are available at Whole Foods). You'll have to experiment with the grind size and amount knobs to get the beans ground right, which will change depending on the bean. You'll know you've got it right when the ""waste"" grounds are a perfect ""hockey puck"" that pops out. I love using the pressure gauge to get it right below the top end of espresso range. And the frother works wonderfully to produce great, foamy steamed milk. Also, KEEP IT CLEAN!

Some of the other reviews regarding failures after 1 or 2 years and parts/warranty issues cause me some go-forward concern, but so far so good."

481,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I used a Breville Roma for about about 5 years and made a mistake and ruined it because of carelessness. I am so glad I decided to upgrade because this machine is powerful, relatively easy to master and it makes delicious coffee drinks. The only difficulty i have had is that the instructions to ""descale"" are rather obscure and impractical, so every time I have to descale I have to go online to comb through the long, often useless instructional videos from the youtubers. I am thankful for their effor to explain how to descale, but most do not explain it sucinctly enough so one can remember the sequence of steps to do it without hiccups. This machine is rather pricy and if something goes wrong you are screwed. Other than that, I have not encountered many objectionable aspects to this machine. I recommend it without reservation."
482,5.0,2021-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is great for my daily espresso fix, it does take some maintenance and tweaking to get to your ideal settings. Once you get those on point you can make amazing coffee drinks. I have yet to perfect my micro foam and coffee designs, but they’ll come in time. I won’t say cleaning is simple, but it’s not hard as long as you do some basics after each use. I love the easy clean-up of the catch trays and all of the included cleaning utensils. The price of this machine will pay for itself in a few short months of not hitting my local cafes, but I do go through a lot more milk now! I do miss the daily interactions I had with my local baristas though, the only downside, in my opinion."
483,1.0,2022-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Got this machine from “Its a Deal.” Huge mistake! Had it two days and it stopped working on the second try. We watched troubleshooting videos to make sure we were using it right and saw many others had the same issue with a defective product. So we tried reaching out to the seller. No response, so we returned item to It’s a Deal In it’s original packaging. I even used my dust buster to remove any coffee grounds left in the grinder. We get our refund of $394 of the original $699 purchase!! Do you know what absolutely ridiculous excuse “It’s a Deal” used for not refunding the full amount??? We sent it back USED, filthy, and still working.... so they justify keeping $300 as a “restocking fee” because they cannot RESELL it! Just so buyers are very warned about this seller selling defective and most likely refurbished products as new, we purchased this SAME product again, but this time through Amazon. It arrived last week and we have enjoyed ten cups of Awesome espresso since then! The machine is working great! By the way “It’ A Deal” do you want to see the photos of your machine taken when we sent it back??? It was packaged and cleaned perfectly and not how you claim! I will be happy to post those pictures right under your response! Buyers be very aware!!!! We should have known something was up when their return address was a residential apartment complex!! I will be taking this up with Amazon. UPDATE: I finally got a response from this seller. He claimed he sent us troubleshooting information. He did... this morning at 9:23 a.m. THIS MORNING after I made this post and a week after we returned the machine to him! He also claimed it was out fault the machine didn't perform. We bought the exact machine last week directly from Amazon and it works perfectly! We also learned this seller distributes these machines out of his residential apartment at 5294 Bishop Street, Apartment D Cypress, CA. There is no company registered with the BBB called ""It's a Deal"" either. He kept $300 of the purchase price for ""restocking fees"" on a defective machine he states he can't sell again. If this is not the epitome of crooked and dishonest third party sellers on Amazon, I don't know what is! Stay away!"
484,5.0,2022-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"How did we ever live without this machine? My wife and I had a cheap esspresso machine for quite a few years (one that I got as a 5 year work anniversary gift). Finally, we decided to splurge and get a new/better one. We budgeted a much lower amount, but did not find anything that really made us say this is it. After reading the reviews and seeing the capabilities of the Barista Express, we decided it was worth a shot.

It took me a little while to play with the settings and understand how to pull a shot properly, but after a few tries I found that this machine makes incredible espressos, lattes, cappuccinos and coffees. I made my first cappuccino for my wife last weekend and she said it was the best she has ever had. This is the ultimate machine for us.

We started with our favorite coffee, Lavazza (super crema) and it did not disappoint. We are going to try some Vietnamese beans next (we love Vietnamese coffee). I must say, the price is high, but for us it was an investment...well spent. We have friends that have Nespresso machines and love the coffee. The amount that they spend in cups would easily pay for this machine in about 1 year. With some good beans, milk and some syrups we can make just about any espresso better than the Nespresso."
485,5.0,2022-01-28, Black Sesame,"I did a lot of research and comparisons before buying this one. Wasn’t sure if the high amount of 5 stars was legit or not but it definitely is.

486,5.0,2022-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After working as a barista for 4 years, the thought of leaving the cafe to go to grad school was upsetting. As an early birthday gift slash cafe departing gift my mom purchased this machine for me. It does everything I need it to in order to prepare any coffee shop drink! Perfect single or double espresso (even coming with dual wall filters to give decent espresso from preground coffee), steam wand with acceptable pressure and good heat for texturing milk (latte art is a must for me and this machine allows me to achieve it 7/10 times), tamp which could be wider but works perfectly fine to be included in the price, nice size water tank with good filter, hot water spicket for americanos, milk pitcher for pouring is sized well to fit with the steam wand, storage tray hidden inside to hold filters and tools, a built in burr grinder which is amazing because it requires no extra space in your kitchen and works just as well as a separate one, and a shot splitter on your portafilter (nice for splitting a double shot into two small mugs and steaming a large quantity of milk to make 2 coffees at once since there’s no dual boiler). I really love this machine and after 4times daily use for the last 2 months I have yet to need to clean it with the tablets provided due to all of the self cleaning the machine does. Water is a great temp for brewing and steaming, and it’s not piping hot but plenty hot enough from the water spicket. This machine is kind of a “why on earth not?” kind of deal."
487,5.0,2022-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very satisfied. We have tried it all from moka pot and all the inexpensive automated pod machines. This one is more hands on than a pod machine but the results are as good as my local coffee shop - and better tasting. I considered a seperate grinder but I really don't think it's needed. The simplicity and AIO aspect of this machine is what I liked the most.

The only extra thing you may need is a larger milk jug if you'd like to make two 12oz lattes at once. The smaller jug is perfect for two 8 oz drinks.

Compared to nespresso pod costs.... Making two lattes per day this machine pays for itself within a year. Here is my quick math. Up to 50 cents for a fresh grind (18 grams of coffee) vs $1.50 for two nespresso pods (12 grams of coffee) for a proper double shot. Making two 8oz lattes per day adds up to a total of $730 in one year for coffee alone. 2*365=730.

We have tried several beans for latte's. Here are my favs in order of best to last from my experience. Illy Medium Roast (smooth and balanced), Lavanzza Super Crema (smooth, lighter flavor with more toasty/cereal flavor), Koffee Kult (more body), Red Bird (more body).

**Update After Nearly 2 Years**
Still running well and we use it almost daily. Keep it clean and it keeps going well."
488,5.0,2022-05-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine rocks. I've had it for 2 years, and I've used it nearly every day for a year, and it's still going strong. For the price, it's very hard to find a machine that comes close to the espresso and steam you can get from it. If you'd rather not drop $1,500 for coffee shop quality espresso, in my opinion, this is the closest you'll get for the price.

My only disappointment is that I haven't been able to make latte art, but I'm not taking off any stars because I'm willing to bet it's partly due to my milk. I've seen videos of others with the same machine getting good art with better milk. I've also used a relative's more expensive espresso machine, and it definitely produces better steam, but it's also 3x the cost. For the cost of this machine, I really can't complain."
489,5.0,2020-05-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you’re like me and you just want to re-create your favorite Starbucks drinks at home, this is the perfect machine. Takes a bit of learning to pull a decent shot but once you get it down, you’ll never drive through Starbucks again."
490,5.0,2022-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased the Breville Barista Express about 2 months ago and I am extremely happy with this purchase. It has a steep learning curve but I overcame that with a combination of YouTube videos (to understand espresso extractions, and channels like Hoon’s coffee who has hundreds of videos about the Barista express) and the right tools (a scale, tamp distributor tool to get a consistent process).

The machine is built well, easy to clean and maintain and the grinder has been pretty consistent so far.

Now it is much easier for me to dial in a shot with any coffee that I have tried. Also avoid stale coffees like Starbucks beans or other grocery store beans and try to get fresh beans from a local roaster!"
491,5.0,2018-08-07, Black Sesame,I purchased this for my daughter to take to college next year so that we got a year use out of it at home before she takes it with her. It did not disappoint. We use RO water and have not had any issues so far. We have owned the machine about a month.

I bought this easy-peasy machine back in 2015 to save on my daily habit of running out for lattes which I made up for in less than four months. Now, it's four years later and I simply cannot break this Breville Espresso Machine . It's still going strong and is my best morning friend! I am NOT a gentle user of machines (my husband will testify), I am not famous for preventive maintenance, yet still, this Breville is the best and has lasted through me and my teenager (who makes a ""poor man's mocha""). I have made many purchases over the years and waited 4 years to write this review. It's the best! I run regular coffee through it mostly and sometimes I get fancy and throw some steamed cream in. If it ever starts losing steam (pun intended!), I will definitely replace it with the same brand name or parts since these guys also have excellent customer service. And no, I'm not getting paid for writing this. I don't even know how to do that???:). You won't be sorry if you make this choice."
496,3.0,2019-10-30, Black Sesame,"I have been using this espresso machine for eight months now. I have called Breville customer service a few times because the manual that comes with it is not updated, as they explained to me.
Let me start by saying that once you get the process down it will make a delicious espresso, with crema and good taste. But...the one thing I have not been able to solve, and there have been many that I needed help with, is that after pouring the first double shot, the machine needs to be purged by running two full tanks of water, before it's ready for another shot. Otherwise, there will be espresso ground in your cup. I also have never been able to get the pressure up very high. It just barely gets into the gray zone where it is suppose to be. If you want a second cup of espresso, or have more than one person using it, it takes about 20 minutes of purging in between. Then you need to do it when you are finished, before you wash everything, so it is ready for the next day. It's very time consuming and quite a bit of maintenance. I gave up on grinding my own beans and use preground now to save time on cleaning the grinder. Plus, it is quite tricky in getting fresh ground beans just right for a good tasting cup."

I am not the high end type of person, in fact I am the least materialistic person. Except when it comes to coffee. I just can't stop. I need that latte every morning. If your like me, just do it. Don't waste 11 years like I did buying coffee. I don't even want to think about how much money went to coffee. Not to mention, this looks so good in the kitchen too.

It was my first serious espresso machine and quite a bit pricier than I expected to spend ( never even considering those in the $1000+ category). The quality and heft are impressive and it was packed well in the box. Directions are pretty straightforward and it set up easily. I found it worthwhile to watch some of the YouTube videos on preparing various types of drinks because the manual doesn’t give much detail.
The operation and drink quality seemed excellent, and that was using pre-ground espresso blend coffee, so I’m really anxious to see how good the flavor is in grinding beans. The steamer is very easy to use and seems to make excellent latte quality milk and froth. Continuing to experiment, but love everything about this machine so far!"
504,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,It takes a lot of effort to take care of this machine. The first time I went to D scale it which is less than a month of having it after the whole process it did not work it’s still showing it’s not fully cleaned. The machine is starting to act up and not allow you to make coffee. Only had it a month and a half
505,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine has changed our lives! We used to hit Starbucks every day, sometimes twice a day, which is very expensive. Since we got the machine, we haven’t hit a Starbucks once.

Special shout out to VR for the most helpful review on how to use the machine! We were able to hit the ground running.

I will say it is kind of a guessing game for how much pressure to use to tamp the espresso grounds to get the right amount of pressure. At first we had to press really hard and now it requires very little pressure. I don’t know if that’s just because it’s been used for a couple of months.

Anyway, get this machine and read VR’s review on how to use it. You will be so happy you did!!! :)"
506,5.0,2022-05-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After experiencing a huge disappointment with a less expensive machine we bought this after hours or reading reviews. We were reluctant at first because of some of the reviews we read but I have to say our machine has been awesome! My wife and I are so happy we bought this machine because it’s makes the best cappuccino and espresso. It makes coffee shop quality coffee and we both Thoroughly enjoy making and drinking our favorite beverages. Not a negative thing to say. It’s been about a month since our purchase, we just hope it lasts. Definitely worth the money so far…"
507,5.0,2022-02-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She is thrilled
with the performance of this machine. She has it since Christmas and already made about 40 espresso drinks! It’s easy to use, easy to clean, and makes great espresso drinks."
508,5.0,2017-10-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Like many of you, I spent hours reading reviews. Many negative reviews come from receiving a machine that is defective from the start, which happens with anything manufactured, but most everyone receives a machine in perfect working order, as did I. My family loves this machine, and it has already saved us quite a bit since they don't insists on going to the coffee house. This replaced a Capresso Ultima, which was truly a beginners espresso machine, and this is the real deal. The grinder is quiet, consistent, and flexible. It seems the designers thought of everything, including the ability to change the extraction time to suit the individual. I do wish I would have ordered it in black, which I didn't even see as an option, and that was my biggest and only disappointment. I found out after I ordered it that the option was available - my bad. Americanos, lattes and espressos are now perfect and full flavored, and the right temperature. Very important note: I couldn't find in any of the reviews how long it took to initially warm up - it is less than 30 seconds, which is less time than it takes to grind and tamp, and reheat is also rapid, there is essentially no waiting time if you take into account preparation and other operations. The footprint is also smaller than I feared it would be. It is perfectly heavy, and feels very solid."
509,5.0,2020-07-21, Black Sesame,Seriously in love! Do not second guess! Buy this Breville. I was an avid Starbucks drinker (almost 4-5times a week) now I NEVER buy Starbucks. It was a learning curve but I caught on easily.
510,5.0,2019-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"But didn't know that I needed until I got it! It took a bit to find the right settings for the grind, and to make sure that I had the correct amount of coffee grinds in order to make a great shot, but it was well worth the journey. Really, it only took a couple of days of experimenting, and I am enjoying a fresh shot every morning.
Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to take off the water container in the back and refill... I don't know if this is the best part, but all my friends get a big 'ol boo-boo lip when they see what I have now. Maybe one day they'll be able to come over and visit, and enjoy a nice shot or cup of cappuccino."
511,5.0,2022-04-29, Black Sesame,"I more than ""like"" this machine so 4 stars isn't adequate but it's not truly 5 star rating.
(previous experience with espresso machines: Delonghi Magnifica & random other non-fully auto machines)

Pros: Makes an excellent (espresso, latte etc). Use good, fresh coffee and you won't be disappointed.
The infusion gauge is really helpful to see where you need to adjust your grind, tamp or coffee amount to get a proper shot.
Love the inclusion of the ""pre-infusion"" stage as well as the ability to minutely adjust your coffee shot to be the way you want it.
Milk is easy to steam, properly...unlike so many consumer machines on the market.
The wand is much easier to clean than most consumer machines. No dis-assembly required.
Grinder is very nice...easily adjustable to whatever grind you prefer and can grind extremely fine. You don't have to have the machine turned on to adjust it.
The storage space for the tamper is perfectly designed.
It comes with a milk pitcher. A nice bonus
I neglected to mention that it comes with 4 baskets (2 dual wall for pre-ground coffee and 2 single wall) as well as a cleaning kit.
I was also impressed with the sturdy build of the machine. None of the components feel or look flimsy.

Cons: Messy. It makes a great cup but just be prepared for a mess (coffee grounds) every time. Coming from a fully auto machine, the mess is going to take some getting used to...
Water tank in back. This is very inconvenient for kitchens with top cupboards without a lot of space btw the counter and cupboard.

Overall this is the best consumer machine I've used so far. I'm very impressed."
512,5.0,2017-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've only been to a drive-thru coffee shop once since I bought this; and I thought to myself ""why did I just spend 6 bucks on this drink when I could just wait til I get home?!""

I had NEVER made an espresso drink before buying this machine. I knew nothing about espresso drinks - only that I like drinking lattes and flat whites. This machine makes the process simple for a novice, yet customizable for the expert users.

It is definitely more involved to make a drink vs just getting a cup of drip coffee. So, I don't use it everyday. But when I'm craving that specialty drink, this is fantastic and I don't have to go anywhere."
513,5.0,2018-08-29, Black Sesame,"I bought this for her for Christmas and she has been very happy with it, and she uses it everyday."
514,5.0,2022-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The spectrum for espresso machines ranges from like $50 to $100,000 so it's hard to buy one that you know will work efficiently without breaking the bank. Honestly I bought a $100 espresso machine and it was garbage compared to this one. I use it all the time and it has every function you need. A built in grinder, grinding settings, different filter cups, single shot espresso button, double shot button, built in steamer, water trey, literally it has everything and it's high quality. I've only had it for a few months but so far it's perfect and has everything you need."
515,2.0,2022-05-14, Black Sesame,"I purchased this in May of 2022, was working great at first. But then the pressure gauge stopped recording any pressure and I noticed the espresso wasn’t coming out as it had before. I had not changed any of the settings or coffee beans for that matter.

I tried different changes in setting such as grind Size and amount, I even weighed out 18g of espresso beans for multiple brews and still had no pressure.

I’m about to contact customer service and see what I can do about this. Update to follow."
516,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's great for amateurs like me, when you need that perfect coffee aroma. Simple to use, BPA free, almost all metal are the most important features for me. Takes a while to figure out the perfect expresso but now I make it every day. No complaints at all.

All I can say ""Wow"" after several weeks now, I have been using my barista everyday, and I am not going back to my other coffee maker. I pretty much mastered making a great cup of coffee, expresso, and mocha so I moved on to other flavors as well Irish coffee, Kahlua too. I honestly can say the days of making a bad cup of joe is over. Also, I noticed I don't have cravings of Starbucks anymore.

Update: Since last May when I received my Barista the grinder started acting up, it would not grind the bean, so I emailed Breville and within a week I packed my Barista and sent it via UPS, note they do send you packing material so you don't have to save your original box (cool). So about two week went by and I received my Barista back and works like new, I'm very pleased with Breville the company and will be buying more appliances from them in the near future. Unlike Cuisinart, I had poor experience with them when my expensive mixer started smelling of burnt copper. I ended up throwing it away. Only 30 some days old."
517,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes on average 4drinks a day. Running great for 2years. Needs 15-20 mins. Of cleaning monthly. Do your research on espresso making and bean prep. If you understand the process, you’ll have the best results."
518,4.0,2019-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,its great
519,5.0,2018-10-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Money can't buy happiness. But it can buy a Breville Barista Express, and that's really close. I'm not a morning person. I hate mornings. I'm annoyed by anyone that talks to me the first 3 hours I'm awake. That all changed when I bought this machine. I'm almost a morning person now, I'm already in a good mood within 15 minutes of waking up,

For years, I have been searching for a machine that would make an incredible cup of espresso like I'd had in Italy when I fell in love with espresso. I bought a basic Delonghi model, which gave me a good cup but nothing as great as I was hoping for. I started roasting my own beans which made an improvement but still wasn't quite where I was hoping for. Then I bought this machine, and liquid magic started coming out. The espresso from this machine is fantastic, it's stupendous, it's incredible.

If you're on the fence about paying the extra money for a great espresso machine, stop thinking about it and buy this machine, it makes a massive difference in your morning espresso.

The steam wand works great, I love the hot water function, and the machine is designed so efficiently, I'm convinced it came from NASA."
520,5.0,2019-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,This has changed the way I enjoy coffee!
521,5.0,2022-04-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I did a lot of research and a lot of thinking on what machine to buy. I wanted to have the liberty to make changes to the coffee-making but at the same time did not want it to be very complicated. It is easy to clean, and the best thing is that it is ever so convenient to use.

Breville BES870XL Barista Express Espresso Machine was the best match for my everyday use. If you work from home, this is a must to have. I am so happy with this purchase."
522,5.0,2022-05-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been using my Barista Express Espresso Machine for about 90 days now. Overall I am very happy with the purchase. There is a learning curve. Read the directions and maybe view some of the videos available on line with step-by-step instructions. A few things I found helpful. Yes, it really helps make a hotter shot if you warm up the machine ahead of time with the filter basket set in place in the machine. If time is short, with the basket in place, depress the two shot button to allow hot water to run through it to warm the filter. I haven't used any fancy beans, just Starbucks Espresso roast I bought at the grocery store. I don't make Lattes, so no experience with that. My husband used the steamer to heat milk for hot chocolate. Results were satisfactory, next time he will heat the milk more."
523,5.0,2020-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Read the instructions and hints for best results. Once set up it's pretty straightforward. Cleanup is easy. Like having the beans freshly ground.
524,5.0,2022-03-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. I bought it when it was on sale, and you can’t beat the quality of this thing for the price. I have really enjoyed learning how to make espresso how I like it, AND I can make any espresso drink I want—lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, americano, etc. You don’t have to use espresso beans, either. It’s been a lot of fun to experiment!
My husband has never liked coffee, but he will drink the lattes I make (slowly introducing more espresso to them ;)), and he even learned to use the machine. Just read the manual—it’s so easy! Troubleshooting is pretty easy too. Again, just read the manual. It’s very straightforward. Do yourself a favor, live the caffeinated life, and BUY THIS MACHINE!"
525,5.0,2022-05-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best money ever spent. For those out there thinking on buying this machine I'll say this is a great espresso maker. One of the best out there if not the best at this price point. Keep in mind, if you're coming from using ground coffee on a cheap espresso machine, there's going to be a learning curve and you'll have to evolve your palate. First things first, buy fresh coffee. Not from Starbucks or Walmart, Costco or Sam's. Find a roaster with a monthly subscription of fresh coffee delivered to your door or a local roaster which might have a subscription but you can also pick up. This will be the best or only option if you are going to buy this or any other machine at this level. Otherwise your espresso is going to taste terrible and you'll endup returning the machine. Trust me, get fresh coffee. Buy a scale, dosing funnel and coffee distributor. All available right here on Amazon. Good luck and enjoy. I'm mine."
526,5.0,2022-09-06, Black Sesame,There's a reason for the price. I never made espressos myself before and this made it enjoyable. I truly feel they thought of everything for everyone. Plus makes really quick hot water.
527,5.0,2022-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Will update more once my shop opens and I've had a chance to put in some use.

I wanted to write a review simply because I have owned many espresso machines in the past, and this one certainly takes the cake.

I opened it up when it arrived just to check it and I'm so glad I did. This thing is nice! I mean, REALLY nice!! All solid parts, non if that flimsy aluminum stuff most have. Comes with some pretty neat accessories, and all around just looks snazzy!!

Will definitely be ordering more when needed!!

Update 9/8/2019
Set this bad boy up to test and started with double shots of espresso for co-workers at my current job. WOW! I'm using jallahava coffee beans and this thing blows any other espresso I've had in the past right out of the water. Was so good they were paying for more the same day and I never even asked! Even extra cream extra sugar coffee people were drinking straight espresso shots. This thing is amazing!"
528,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So this is an amazing machine, the trick is you have to learn how to use it from a pro. My brother came over and spent 3 full hours to test and do coffee runs, and finally we nailed it. The trick is you have to get the grind correct, the pressure, and temperature. We discovered that running the machine 20 minutes before starting to use is what you do to make the machine come up to temp, then running the steamer before and after every use makes your water temp reach the max. Also make sure to weigh the coffee with a scale for each use to know the exact measurements. So the bottom line it’s a science to get it just right with the perfect taste, so if you are that person that looks for perfection and you have patience, then this is for you. If you are a person who drinks drip coffee from a Mr coffee machine, then this is not for you!"
529,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pros: It made great espresso, the grinder worked well, and it did a great job frothing milk.

Cons: From the other reviews I've read, we were lucky ours lasted 3 years. We made 2-3 espressos a day, and at almost exactly 3 years ours stopped pushing water through the portafilter. It made the same loud buzzing noise it always did but water would just dribble out. We did all the recommended maintenance and cleaning religiously so I don't think the fault was on our end. After it broke, I read the one-star reviews here on Amazon to see if others had the same issue and noticed a lot of people weren't as lucky and theirs hadn't lasted as long. I learned Breville doesn't provide replacement parts but will repair the machines for around $200-$300 (with shipping costs). Unfortunately, the repairs weren't reliable; machines simply broke again, so I didn't go that route.

Instead I did some research and it seemed like the solenoid valve was the most likely issue so I ordered one from a third party for around $60. It took around 3 months for it to arrive, and was fairly easy to replace, but it didn't solve the problem. Today, while reading more reviews, I realized that the loud buzzing noise ours had made since day one (while the pump is running to make the espresso) was not normal. I'm going to try and replace the pump (around $45) and see if that helps. If not, I guess I'll sell it for parts.

Since Breville doesn’t seem to provide either high quality products, or at least stand behind them with good customer service and replacement parts, I won’t ever buy a Breville product again."
530,5.0,2022-04-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I don't often write reviews, but this outstanding product really deserves it! Beyond giving me outstanding coffee every day, exceeding what I get from most coffee shops and blowing Starbucks away, it's a delight to the senses - the hiss of the steam pressure in extracting the beans, the whoosh and gurgling of the frothing of milk, the oil-dark espresso with rich crema, the robust aroma of the espresso, oh, and the TASTE of the coffee! Truly fantastic coffee, every day! Once you brew your first half-dozen cups experimenting to get the grind and amount settings right for your preferred beans (and the settings WILL differ somewhat particularly for oily versus dry beans), you will enjoy a dynamite coffee day after day. It's quick in getting you your first coffee of the day (warm-up time is minimal, maybe a minute, for both the extraction and frothing heaters), and it's easy to clean up afterward. It even alerts you when it's time to do a descaling. I make lattes and cappuccinos, and my wife makes americanos, and we're totally spoiled now by the coffee we make at home. I've even grown annoying to guests who I almost BEG to let me make them a latte so I can show off this machine (or my barista skills)! We've had this six months, with no technical issues or any hint of poor craftsmanship or quality. Quit reading reviews and just BUY IT. You'll love it."
531,2.0,2021-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I always try to start out with the good: Breville's Barista Express feels like its built well, very hefty and solid, and it looks nice on the counter. Also, it comes included with a wide range tools that are actually good quality (milk pitcher, tamp, leveler, cleaning tools, etc). This is where the good review ends.

My experience became teeth gnashingly frustrating almost from the moment of unboxing. We (my husband and I) followed the ""quick start guide"" instructions included to the letter, and while they were easy to understand and follow, we soon found out that they did not include nearly everything a new buyer should know. The level of adjustment and calibration needed to get started is ridiculous, and we did every single thing the user manual suggested but NEVER got a good cup of coffee. I went through an entire bag of new coffee beans but the grounds never changed coarseness (despite following instructions to remove a pin and change ""range"" manually) or created crema at all (I know for a fact I did everything on my end to maximize this). The coffee was always bitter and thin! We eventually also noticed that the water pressure was very low despite the positive reading on the gauge.

So after we tried everything we could we thought, ""maybe it's something we haven't thought of"" so we tried to call customer service. Almost all day the line was busy, and the two times it actually picked up, the call machine told me to ""leave my number when prompted to be added to a call-back list"" despite never receiving a prompt. Then it hung up on me! Dead end! So we were like ""okay maybe they're busy for Christmas, we'll just write a question on their support site"". When we went to the site, both the links for the manual's PDF and to contact customer support sent us to unrelated pages!! So basically, customer service for Breville products does not exist.

It was at this point my husband and I decided keeping this product was not worth the time or effort, so we returned it. It should go without saying that if you spend almost $500 on anything, it should work as advertised, and if for some reason cannot you should have someone available to help!! What kind of company leaves you high and dry like that? (Dry because there was no coffee in my mug today kthnx) We are very annoyed and feel scammed. Don't let this happen to you!"
532,5.0,2019-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,It makes espresso and cappuccino like professional machines. It is very impressive. The taste of the brews is wonderful also.
533,4.0,2022-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Overall this is a fairly impressive machine. Getting the right grind, compression packing, & resultant pressure is tricky and challenging. You really have to learn to dial all your variables in to achieve the recommended pressure. If you do achieve it, then the expresso shots produced are very good. The steamer works well, so once your steamed milk is ready, then create your shot so that you can get the steamed cream mixed in within the first 10 seconds . . . this will produce good results. We just wish the machine and system process was more robust and less temperamental so achieving the desired results is not so challenging."
534,5.0,2021-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Brilliantly made bean grinder/brewer for novice or skilled brewer. general note about all milk wands-FYI: saw a video on milk frothing (all brands) that called out being sure you steam purge the milk that may get inside the wand when frothing, because once milk gets up beyond the wand it can't be removed and will smell to high heaven.
This unit makes ALL nespresso makers third rate. (we own two Citiz and sold a nespresso vertuoline because it brews at a low temp 30 degrees below recommended temp and ""crema"" is 100% foam 0% Crema)

We have had bean roasters (they stink bad) and stand alone bean grinders in the past and found both a pain. We weren't sure about having the grinder built in, but love it!

The GOOD: most everything, Hidden storage is excellent, water storage is big and filtered, waste water hold is large and cleans well, hot water spout gives a perfect measured amount for an Americano, unit heats fast, automatic and/or user dialed in settings work great and are a great addition/option.

The not so good: Bean access to grinder is a hole on the right, so grinding tends to produce a hole and beans need to be moved to fill the hole when you have just a half cup of beans in the grinder.
Stainless scratches extremely easy."
535,3.0,2021-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'll get to it in just a bit - I've had some trouble, *twice*. But first, the pros-n-cons.

Pros:
+ Built in grinder has done a fantastic job over the year that I've owned the product. Like all grinders (and food prep equipment in general) it has to be cleaned for best performance. That said, it is one of the better grinders I've had at home - conveniently built-in.
+ Pours a great shot! Once tweaked a bit, the machine performs predictably, and consistently (when working :-/ -- see below). The guests to our home constantly complement our drinks.
+ The steam wand does a fantastic job - I am able to easily pour latte art with all brands of Organic Almond and Coconut Milk. It is a bit slower than a commercial steam wand, of course (30-45 secs or so to microfoam and correct temp), but quick enough to be able to create several drinks for friends. This is not a commercial machine, and should not (could not) be used in that capacity. You are looking at around three minutes-ish, per excellent latte.

Cons:
+ I am on my THIRD MACHINE in ONE YEAR. Unfortunately, after approximately three to four months each, on my first two machines, the solenoid began to have issues (""arcing"" sound; ""sticking""). No amount of descaling seems to permanently resolve the issue, and unfortunately, the issue begins to disrupt the ""pour"". Breville has been quite nice about the return; however, I have a feeling that I may end up -soon- without support as my warranty expires - at which point I will have a $600 espresso machine that doesn't work properly.
+ The auto-grind selector doesn't seem to grind even amounts when selecting between one and two shots. In other words, if I tweak the ""perfect"" amount for a single shot, and then switch over to a double-shot, the dispensed amount is too much. This is easy to work around, of course, as I can manually turn down the dispensing amount for double-shots and up again, slightly, for a single shot. Just a bit of an observation, really."
536,5.0,2022-05-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this thing. Zero issues since I bought it about 9 Months ago. Easy to run, easy to maintain, easy to clean. I use the lavazza super crema beans and have the grind and amount set pretty low and it churns out really good espresso. I generally heat a mug of milk in the microbe for one minute and then steam it the rest of the way, but that’s because it’s usually 6am and I am impatient. The steamer heats up the milk just fine without needing to use the microwave, if you have another 30 seconds more. I love this thing. I’m attached to it. I have feelings for it. I was worried I’d spend the money and then something would break or fall short or just be disappointing but it’s really worked out well, and unless I am traveling out of town, I never buy a latte as mine at home are now just as good."
537,5.0,2020-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Perfect!!! I’m a new mother, and a full time worker. My coffee keeps me alive! I was a professional barista for several years. This machine heats up quickly and has a wonderful Manuel steam wand. Using this machine I felt like I was back at the café using the Lavazza espresso maker. It has so many grind settings. I prefer a finer setting then 3 shots of espresso with some extra dry foam on my giant cup. And when the filter is full it even has a sign to tell you to dump the water and a light to let you know when to clean out the filter in the water tank. It’s the best home machine I’ve ever had! Simply beautiful."
538,3.0,2019-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We had gotten it in a few days ago after we came back from our honeymoon. Even though we had a few gift cards, we bought it the price for a new one. It’s definitely been used. It has coffee grounds in it and crusty milk on the wand. While my husband and I don’t care using a used machine, we definitely want a credit since we bought it for the price of the new one."
539,2.0,2022-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had this machine for about a year now and it’s incredibly high maintenance. Having come from a Nespresso machine which is SUPER easy and CLEAN! Randomly the machine either decides to no longer grind or no longer pour. And you guessed it, that happens at 6am when I need coffee the most. Also there are coffee grinds all over the place each time we make coffee just adding to my already long list of cleaning tasks at the end of the day. The coffee is of course fresh when it does work but I’m not sold that for this price all this work is worth it. $800 is a lot of Starbucks or nespresso without the headache and mess."
540,2.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,Pressure gauge stopped working within a few months. The product was very lightly used and should be higher quality than this for this price..
541,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Personal cappuccino at home and luscious iced coffee. Works great.
542,5.0,2017-09-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took me a long time to research espresso machines and I finally narrowed my selection to two espresso makers. The Breville BES870Xl and another brand which will remain anonymous. I decided to purchase the other brand for several hundred dollars more right before Christmas, based on positive amazon reviews. As soon as I began unpacking the “other” brand, I knew I would be deeply disappointed in the espresso machine. To make matters worse, the machine simply did not function properly and I returned it. Amazon is awesome with defective products and I couldn’t be happier because of this.

My replacement was the Breville BES870XL.
Simply put, right out of the box, you could appreciate the quality of the espresso maker. And within 10 mins, I was grinding and brewing espresso shots. Each shot got better and better as I became more familiar with the functions. I truly wish I would have bought this product the first time. Hands down best value for the cost.

Is it a professional espresso machine? No.
Does it make a good cup of espresso? Absolutely. 10 times better than that $5 cup from you know where

Highly recommend this unit."
543,5.0,2021-10-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good quality for the price
544,5.0,2022-03-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I worked at Starbucks for many, many years. This machine pulls a shot that tastes exactly like it came from a $15k machine. I literally could not tell the difference. Pressure gauge lets you know the exact pressure needed for a true espresso shot. The machine is beautiful to look at, easy to use and very easy to clean. It comes with starter water filter and cleaning tabs. The supplies needed to maintain this machine are also extremely affordable. I really regret putting off buying this machine for so long. It’s everything it’s advertised to be! 10/10 would recommend."
545,3.0,2022-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville Barista Express makes an excellent shot of espresso and it's not that difficult to get it adjusted in terms of under extracting or over extracting. I only had to discard 3 shots,before getting a great shot, but I'm finding the steamer knob very difficult to turn and sometimes it won't engage at all, making it impossible to steam the milk.
Since that is half the reason I bought it, I'm thinking of returning it. Not sure if I just got a lemon, but I'm quite disappointed considering the price!"
546,5.0,2017-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I haven't been without an espresso machine since the 90's and this is the first American brand espresso machine I've owned. It is a workhorse and still going strong after 3 years with daily use. The grinder is decent, and if a stray shard of a bean jams it, it only takes a finger tap on the side to solve that. And yes, the quality of the extraction is impressive. Easy to clean, clever storage tray for all the fiddly bits, looks good, and makes my morning every single day."
547,5.0,2021-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,So impressed! The espresso is delicious. I love that I can be my own barista at home and I’ve even learned how to make martini espressos!! So happy my hubby got this for me instead of the nespresso. I feel spoiled!
548,5.0,2022-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband bought me this machine 2.5 years ago for a birthday present and it is the best gift ever. It is a mini industrial espresso machine my husband can’t believe how well it’s made. I’ve never had issue with it besides the grinder not grinding a year in but it just needed to be cleaned thank for my husband is super savvy with the help of YouTube videos! I use this machine about 5x a day. I went from spending 25-30 a day at Starbucks which equals about 9500 a year to 1200 a year in coffee! I have Starbucks in my home and now I don’t even like to get my lattes made at Starbucks bc i make them so much better! I can’t live without this machine it’s truly amazing. Don’t second guess it. Just purchase it! If you drink as much espresso as me go for it. You will save money in the long run. This machine paid for itself in 2 months!

550,5.0,2018-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine is awesome and we use it every single day. It quickly paid for itself as we now rarely buy coffee out, and frankly the drinks we make at home as good if not better than what you get at a coffee shop. If you don't have any barista or espresso making experience I would definitely recommend watching a few Youtube videos to help get you started. Having no experience of our own we were a little intimidated when we first setup the machine but after playing around with it and watching a number of Youtube videos quickly became comfortable. We love this espresso machine so much we have actually ended up giving one to family members for Christmas and would highly recommend."
551,5.0,2022-01-01, Black Sesame,"1st week report; using Starbucks whole bean espresso from Amazon...
Work from home wife can't leave house while on the clock to get favorite espresso drink. Was able to make exact duplicate after only 2 attempts. Has made other drinks for friends that claim hers are as good as coffee shop's. As that was the intent for purchasing it has been a solid performer. Unit is larger than typical 10-cup drip coffee maker, but still compact for all it does and appears to be solidly constructed. Clean up is minimal. Using reverse osmosis supplied water to prevent scale buildup and extend product life. Only time will tell regarding longevity. So far, very pleased about spending up a little for this model as it should pay for itself in about 9-10 months."

 This machine is really compatible with all your needs!
But to keep it for long time you gotta take care of it. It has PID control steamer which is very fast. It has a programable dialing of extraction and time which could be changed in minutes. The grinder is not the best but this is how to make it fast and like the more advanced ones. Change the inner grinding setting to 2 and normal one at 3, this will make it faster and better.
I recommend getting these thing with the machine
1. A bottomless portafilter (for better extraction)
2. A distributor (will make your life easier)
3. A second tamper ( the one that comes in is bad)
4. A dosing funnel (will lower waste)
Thanks Breville!"
553,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"I am a coffee sob. Not your average snooty frufru coffee afficienado that spends $5. a day for fancy coffee at a trendy place, but one who has a deep appreciation for all things coffee. I spent years looking at reviews of espresso machines to replace an aging commercial machine I enjoyed for about 16 years. When it quit pumping and our pump replacement didn't fix it we finally let it go for parts.
That being said, I entertained going for a fully automatic super machine, until I realized that the trade offs weren't worth the few hundred dollars extra money because the resulting product wasn't worth it.
I thought I was settling with the Brevia. Boy was I mistaken. I love this machine as much or MORE than my LaPavon Pub V. After a few quick adjustments and simple callibrations, I am pulling perfect double shots and topping with perfect thick dry foam for my favorite afternoon treat, a REAL unsullied cappuccino.
I learned to pull shots on a fancy Restaurant machine by the Gaggia brothers themselves, and this little BES870XL with it's exquisite pressure gage ensures that all the elements for your perfect cup are at your finger tips.
Thanks Breville."

557,5.0,2016-08-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Solid little unit - does not move around on the counter - that is important to me. Nice looking unit on my counter. Decent size water tank, you do need to watch it. We almost exclusively make double shots. Have a Brevell burr grinder from a few years ago, this one holds the decaf. Nice to have the options later in the day. I have not adjusted the grind or programmed the water flow or temperature. I've only made one mocha with skim milk. I will need to practice a bit with the frother. And I have an instant hot dispense at the sink so don't use the hot water dispense on this unit. There are some good u-tube videos that show how to operate better than the book. Use a good organic Sumatra whole bean. Plus: Two shots mixed with a chocolate protein drink and crushed ice makes a really nice lunch! I see prices fluctuate, so watch for a deal. You can spend more on a Jura, this really fits our needs. We make about 4 espressos/day, until our friends find out we have a barista!"
558,5.0,2019-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,The benefits of a built-in grinder and a pressure gauge are essential for good tasting coffee. We love it.
559,5.0,2020-04-08, Black Sesame,"Best bang for your buck espresso machine. It comes with just about everything you need to get started as a home barista. The coffee grinder is excellent and suited for espresso. The frothing wand is powerful but does need skill to finesse a good microfoam. Hot water function is great for heating cups and making tea for non-coffee drinkers. It does take time for one to pull a good shot. I have it down to a 3- fine setting 99% of the time. I was auto dosing the grinds but have since been able to eye it for double shots. The key is the tamper. If you follow all instructions it's very easy to pull great shots. The pressure gauge will let you know if grind and tamper are on par.

I think this machine is more for an immediate to experienced espresso maker as it does take some skill. That said, for newbies the dual wall baskets will help with lack of skill. The razor dosing tool helps with consistency.

If I had a con it would be the mess the grinder makes otherwise a great overall machine just have some patients and be an educated consumer. Tons of videos and reviews out there to make a good decision for yourself. Don't get caught up with coffee snob reviews.. You can get a great shot from this as well as a 1500k machine. Only really difference would be the size and number of boilers."
560,5.0,2020-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Product looks great and works perfectly! The only thing I have to say is that this is NOT a machine for someone new to making espresso. There are a lot of steps involved with making sure your grind size/amount are correct, your tamp has the right pressure, your extraction period and pressure is accurate, cleaning the portafilter and steamer, etc. It's perfect for making craft espresso at home but tedious."
561,4.0,2018-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've tried everything: French Press, Aeropress, Drip, Percolator, Mocha Pot, and even Instant Coffee. But compared to all of those other methods, this espresso machine feels like a huge step up. Having said that, I do not know how this compares to more expensive machines, but for my >$1000 price point this one seemed to be the best option.

It is simple to use and does what it is supposed to.

You do need to mess around a bit to find the right balance of grind amount/fineness/tamping pressure to achieve the right pull. Otherwise, super simple. I would also recommend getting some Torani syrups to spice up your steamed milk."
562,5.0,2020-05-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Does a great job, but it can be messy. The flavor is spot on when using Starbucks espresso beans."
563,3.0,2022-04-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Less functional and less efficient than it initially appears. It is really tedious to duplicate your effort and the machine is only responsive to having that exact same combination of factors every time. On the first go around, getting everything tuned in took me a pound of coffee; but, will have to start all over depending on which beans I use next. Speaking of which, changing beans before the hopper is empty is a complete mess. If someone wants a decaf, you need to have a second grinder available. Upon receipt, the default settings for grind size, grind amount and pour volume were all way off. If you want that pressure gauge to climb up at all, will have to powder the beans, pile that grind up until it makes a mess and increase the pour volume considerably (two shot pour, was pulling 1 oz of espresso). Notably, I have also had to increase the shot temperature however have no way to know what the current settings are. The discrete little tamp is cool but getting that pressure right is the only way to pull a dry puck. A 30 lb click tamp is so important to getting this machine to work right, they should have provided a calibrated pressure tamp. The steam wand is either on or off, even though you still have to prime the steam a bit there is no way to vary the pressure - getting stuff up to temp takes quite a while and the provided steam mug is way too small to be practical (use it to prime the steam). You don't see it, but this machine is secretly peeing itself and you will have to empty the drain tray pretty much every time you use the machine. So, extra grinder, extra steaming carafe, extra tamp and some ongoing tuning and maintenance... Less might have been More in this case. In hindsight, Rancilio Silvia is more my style."

565,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is steller machine. Waited 3 full months to give this feedback. Don't think. For 599, this is steal!"
566,5.0,2021-11-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it. I swear it tastes better than a ~$7.00 latte or cappuccino from my local SB and it is aesthetically pleasing in my kitchen.
Note: If you're a coffee novice, I really recommend you spend time learning about frothing and how to work the machine.. You'll definitely want to purchase a thermometer for the milk frothing to prevent you from over- or under-heating it. Believe me, it's well worth it or you can mess up the taste. You'll want to set the grounds to be really fine and pack it hard to get the right pressure for taste. Lastly, use the program button to configure how much liquid to use when it creates the expresso."
567,5.0,2015-09-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After watching many online videos, my worry before buying this was that it was going to be too much fuss to make a cup of coffee in the morning and that I would, out of convenience, go back to the Keurig. Didn't happen. Yes, there were some not-as-great lattes at first, but it only took a handful of tries to figure out exactly how to make it the way I like. It is amazingly helpful as I'm working from home to have a great coffee...latte, cuppachino, etc....every morning. Okay, and afternoon. It's actually easier than it looks at first, don't be intimidated. Absolutely no regrets about spending the money, we are all enjoying it so much that it was totally worth it."
568,2.0,2022-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I will start off by stating I am not an espresso expert. However I have had many and this one was fairly okay.

I found the basic actions needed to be clear to understand. There were some advanced features that aren’t intuitive (require pressing two buttons unrelated to the task at hand to make happen - keep the manual close by). I also found the steam wand and pitcher not ideal - tight to fit on the platform and wand not long enough to reach it on the counter. Must hold it while warming and frothing.

But my biggest challenge was seeing a friends unit where the pressure gage didn’t work at all. Mine is the same. I corresponded 4+ times with Breville that the gage never worked (thus broken? Unless a quick fix). The last email asked me what milk I was using. Seems customer service can understand - and well who has time to iterate?

Item returned. I guide any future buyer to be like a hawk on your device and if any remote issue - get quick clarity or return it so you dodge what I think could be a painful fix thru warranty."
569,5.0,2022-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Went to Italy and, after I had my first cappuccino, I had an Eureka moment. I have never been a coffee drinker, but this was different. Came home and bought this Breville model. Took me several weeks to become proficient with it. I actually read the instructions which are OK, not great and watched YouTube videos. Once I'd mastered the basics, the espresso & cappuccinos from this machine are comparable to those I had in Italy. I am very pleased. 3 observations: (1) the process is not that quick--be patient, it's worth it and (2) to get the right pressure for espresso, this machine wants to be warmed up--run the espresso cycle a couple of times without coffee before you make your first cup and (3) yes, you will use a lot more coffee than you did making regular coffee and it really will make a difference in what beans you use."
570,5.0,2022-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,This thing is amazing!! Purchased it 3 months ago and I've used it everyday since. Best investment that I've made in years.
571,5.0,2016-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We replaced another Breville espresso maker that we had had for many years. The machine itself is built like a tank and would have held up for much longer, but the electronic controls had stopped working.
This newer model is a definite upgrade in terms of function. I love that the grinder is built in and the unit only requires one plug. It looks neat on the countertop. The hot water feature for warming your mug ahead of time or dispensing water for some other hot drink (the water comes out a separate spigot so does not taste of coffee) is great; I also pour that water into the espresso pot to take the chill off the metal before brewing. The steaming wand works faster and better than on our old machine.
Grinding, tamping and brewing the espresso is quick and the process is conveniently laid out. It initially took some patience and experimenting to get the perfect shot of espresso, but once you have the settings adjusted the way you want them (grind texture, amount of coffee beans ground for each shot, amount of water dispensed), those settings are saved even when you turn of the power.
We have only been using it for a few weeks, so I can't speak to the issue of longevity. The heavy-duty stainless steel case I have full confidence in, but it remains to be seen how well the electronics and grinder will hold up. We were definitely not in the market for a $1000-plus espresso maker, so the Breville was a good choice."
572,4.0,2014-09-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Being a novice that just loves coffee this has made things a little easier. There is definitely a learning curve. I have had my machine for several months now and I still struggle with getting my extraction into espresso range, though I have become more accurate. I now prefer the taste of the drinks I make at home over the coffee shops drink I buy when I am on the road or on a time crunch."
573,5.0,2021-01-27, Black Sesame,I’ve had his machine for over 2 months now and I’m still very happy with it. Very easy to use. The coffee it makes is superior to the Keurig I had previously. If you love coffee and want a quality cup at home or latte’s this is a great value .
574,5.0,2015-05-21, Black Sesame,Easy to use and great every time !
575,5.0,2018-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"love it. It remind me of the espresso I use to take in the traditional bistro in Paris, way better than the one I can find in the coffee chain in us. I bit challenging the find the right spot with the settings when you change your beans, but once found it's delicious and fun. A bit messy as it tend to have small coffee ground around but not that dramatic. Another review was advising to take a set of small cloth to clean up the place a bit between 2 coffee and a knock box, and it's definitely a must have. I will add a good air tight container to keep the bean fresh as the overhead bean compartment is not that big."
576,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Absolutely fantastic machine. We recently took a trip to Italy, and came back with a desire to make fresh Espresso's and Americano's. We previously had a Tassimo single cup machine and a Cuisinart 10 cup machine. This machine is a single cup, hand crafted with love machine. I would not try to serve a dozen guests with it (unless I had 6 of them), but for making a single cup it is a great machine. While each stage is essentially manual, we have become adept enough to make a really consistent, slightly frothy Americano every time. There is a certain craft to using this machine as it doesn't consistently put out the same amount of grinds, but when tamping down the puck there is a feel for how dense it should be that can easily be accomplished. Once a cup is brewed, the puck pops right out of the filter and cleanup is easy. Extra water and stray grinds end up in a little basin underneath that is easy to slide out, rinse, and pop back in. The machine is very fast to heatup also. I can turn it on, get my thing together, and make a quick cup on my way out the door. Overall, we were very impressed with the machine. The quality is top notch, looks great on the counter, and the coffee it makes is perfect. Couldn't ask for a better experience making coffee. We've had ours for several months, still working like day one."
577,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased 6 years ago. Has been used a minimum of 2X per day for a double shot espresso drink. Sometimes much more. Has seen relatively consistent maintenance. We clean and replace filters regularly but extend beyond the guidance provided. A few very minor self repairs--cleaned out the grinder, hopper, tightened a seal, etc. Absolute workhorse. Consistent, predictable and very good results. Nothing lasts forever. If this wears out before I do, I'll buy another in a heartbeat. Don't need the digital displays. This gives full control and it's really not that difficult to make a cappuccino, americano, latte with a good tool. This is a great tool. The integrated burr grinder is a must have."
578,4.0,2022-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It takes for a while to experiment to find out the best grinding size and the coffee amount, but after this process, the coffee machine just produces awesome coffee, which is even better than many coffee shops. There are three things that can make this machine better though. First, the default extraction volume is not close to a typical espresso shot, my suggestion is to purchase another measurement cup and re-program it yourself. Another complaint about this machine is the input to the integrated grinder is too small to let coffee beans flow smoothly, you often need to redistribute the coffee beans manually to make it work. Last one is that there not pre-heat button for steamer, so the steam will take a long time to produce after you switch to steam mode. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good machine which makes quality coffee."
579,5.0,2020-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this at Christmas. I ended up returning the first one because I couldn't get thr espresso guage to get in the espresso range. After returning this one and ordering a new one -- I had the same problem. I called Breville and they walked me through it. 100% user error.

You have to use the right grind size (grey dial) AND the right filter basket (single versus double wall for fresh grinds from whole bean.

I have not been to a coffee shop since Christmas and it is now the end of April. I threw away the Keurig (you drink these for a week and the Keurig coffee tastes awful!).

Best purchase I've EVER made. Hands down. 5 stars. Great quality and once you learn how to properly use it --- easy.

Get a quality bean and get to brewing fresh coffee!"

581,4.0,2021-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love espresso but had never brewed one before. I wanted a machine that would give me high quality, reliable results once I figured out what I was doing. The Barista Express delivers! There was a bit of a learning curve, but I enjoyed the trial and error and eventually achieving exactly what I wanted. This is not a one touch and go machine, you need to pay attention to what you are doing. Margin for error is moderate. Worth it for the features and full capability. My only complaint is the milk frothier seems to take longer than I think it should, but I believe that may be technique related. We’ll see. I love this machine because it looks like an old school, serious yet elegant tool on my counter, more so than the next model up which has a touch screen. (That seems weird to me, maybe geared towards millennials which I am not.) Would definitely buy this one again."

583,5.0,2021-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Don’t do it!!!! I thought I’d save money by making this purchase….well you won’t!!! What will actually happen is you will find out you are a coffee snob who wants to perfect every cup(and you can with this machine). You’ll also start drink more coffee and spending more on beans! You’ll discover that chain coffee isn’t very good and you’ll want to travel less until you fine a way to take this machine with you!!!
584,4.0,2018-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just my wife and myself use them but all 4 have had problems the last $1,999 one was in for repairs 5 of the last 8 months, everyone had to be sent in for repairs about 1 to 5 times a year and they would keep it for a month, and they would send it back, but it came back with more problems so we again had to turn around and send it right back. I really don’t think they even do anything to them the 1st time you send it in for repairs. The repair department is very sad. They need to either make them better or lower the price."

Definitely perfect for someone who loves coffee and espresso based drinks such as latte's americanos, and cappuccinos. I've only owned mine for 8 months and I think I've already gotten my moneys worth!"
586,5.0,2020-10-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had the machine for about three weeks now, and I am of the opinion that the Barista BES870XL is a well engineered machine.It took some adjustment to understand how some of the elements work, but I am almost completely proficient. The first issue I had was with the grinder that would not grind. After reading about it and watching a couple of videos I understood how to simply solve the problem. Remove the hopper, clean the upper burr and done... The next issue was wet/dry puck. Again, I read a review in this forum and realized that it is related to the amount of coffee in the portafilter. done. Next thing I have to figure out is the grind amount. The knob that is meant to adjust such amount does not appear to work. I have realized that the grind amount is related to the grind fineness, but this does not explain (for me) the usefulness of the knob. I will keep experimenting, though. To conclude, the features included in the machine: PID, pre-infusion, auto-purge, razor etc.. are well integrated and make this a wonderful machine for the price point. I hope that with proper maintenance it will last years, and I will provide updates on this topic as time goes by."
587,1.0,2022-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"i purchased this twice. the first time, it didn't work at all. the power button did not work. i returned it. i ordered a second one. guess what? after i wasted half of a 1lb bag of coffee beans, thinking I was doing something wrong, i learned that the pressure gauge is broken. so again, another useless $700+ piece of metal. no one could help me--not breville or amazon. they did not help me at all except open a ticket. yeah let me hold onto this extremely expensive item and wait for you to get back to me, yeah right.
if these weren't red flags enough to stay far away from this machine, i don't know what is. i bought it specifically from all the good reviews i saw and now i feel lied to. for over $700 you'd expect it to work above and beyond."
588,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Getting into making your own Coffee and drinks?

THIS is the machine. It has everything you need.

The grinder is fast, effective and convenient.
The steam wand is easy to take apart and clean with the included tools.

My only frustrations is the grind fineness wheel on the left side of the machine. After setting 5, it gets hard to move the wheel any lower.

On the right side, the water/steam knob is pretty stiff, and it's the cheapest feeling part of the machine.

But that's it. This machine has already saved mr hundreds making my own coffee, and having the freedom of any drink you want at your disposal is fantastic.

Make sure to read the Mega Review for this machine for all the little important details, and some must-haves, like a knock box, cotton cloths, and Toranni Syrup, if you really want to go crazy with your drinks."

590,5.0,2021-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is hands down the best espresso machine we have ever owned. It’s used 2-4 times daily. It makes espresso better than our local Starbucks, consistently. The puck filled causes a little Easter but that’s not a deal breaker for the level of quality espresso and creama you get from this machine . The frothing wand can be finicky, meaning sometimes inexplicably it stops heating and pumping when turned on . No big deal though , I just turn it off and back on and that seems to fix it.
This thing is simply awesome. Not sure how we lived without it. It’s saving us at least a grand a year in Starbucks costs."
591,2.0,2021-12-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First let me say that this machine looks really great, I love how it looks on my kitchen counter. It is also (in theory) a good value considering the functionality supported. However, I have a few major issues with it:
- Having only 5 buttons to control program and configure cycles, start different cleaning cycles is very limited. Make sure you'll keep the user's manual near you as these will involve very often pressing on several buttons at the same time for X seconds etc. Breville doesn't provide easy-to-follow videos online, and not even ""How-to"" photos in the user's manual. Thankfully other users have taken the time to make some videos on Youtube, which helps a lot, but Breville,...really?
- Even when cleaning regularly the dual wall filters will get clogged fairly quickly. On its own it's not a huge deal if they need replacement every year (they're less than $10 each). ONLY ISSUE is they have been discontinued with Breville and they are impossible to find anywhere, so I'm left with only single wall filters. Only 13 months after having purchased this machine...
- Recently the duration of each shot started to be quite random, 3 seconds the first one, 10 seconds the second time, with no apparent reason.
- the extraction (on the portafilter) started to leak after a year, a bit disappointing but at least the rubber joint is not discontinued and I was able to replace thanks to other YouTube videos (nothing from Breville of course).
For the reasons above, I will be shopping for another machine and needless to say it will not be a Breville. As for the value, for a 1 year of okay operations, it's pretty disappointing."
592,4.0,2021-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was so happy when my Barista Express Espresso from Breville arrived. My first few attempts that day was disastrous. I found numerous youTube vids and spend a good part of the day going through them. Then I pulled my first perfect espresso! Since Sept 2019, i have pulled close to a 1,000 espressos. Once you have the basics under control it is child’s play. I switch it on the moment I walk into the kitchen and only pull an espresso after half an hour. It is a good temperature then. I tweak the ground size as per new pack, I also do not keep a whole pack in the holder. My husband and teenagers have climbed onto the barista bandwagon too and between espresso’s and lattes we save on time and money que’ing at coffeeshops! Best investment of 2019"
593,5.0,2021-10-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Hubby and I use this usually twice a day. I worked as a barista for a while so I knew what I was getting into — it’s work, not your typical automatic machine but it is so worth it. Saving more than $5/day by not taking that trip to Starbucks and tastes even better in my opinion!"
594,5.0,2021-08-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine! You get a lot for what you pay for! At my work they have the more expensive versions of this machine but they are fully automatic. I get much better coffee from the barista express than I can get from the automatic machines at work. However, you're gonna have to be more hands-on! If you like to be more involved in the process, this machine is great! It's easy to clean and maintain. The tank lasts a few days and you need to empty the tray every few days (I just do it daily) as well. My old machine required refill and emptying every 2 uses. The grinder gives you very fine grinds for espresso. Another great thing about this machine is that since it's so popular, there's a huge community in forums and in YouTube that offer a lot of tips a d tricks. However, don't substitute tutorials for reading the manual. I would totally recommend this machine."
595,4.0,2019-04-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I purchased this product after reading all the other reviews and couldn’t be happier with my purchase! Mind you I’ve only been using it for a month thus far but it get multiply daily uses and even got taken on spring break in our fifth wheel with no issues to note. I’m a beginner with this side of the coffee house and found setup and use very easy. Cleaning isn’t a hassle at all. The only small bad note I have thus far is the puck cup will get stuck from time to time which isn’t a big deal for a single cup but when you are wanting to make multiply drinks it must be retrieve while hot, which isn’t a big deal if you have heat impervious hands! The machine overall seems like a high quality coffee store and it’s heavy so if you wanna travel with it in a camper keep that in mind. I’m very happy with this product and see it lasting a good while!"
596,5.0,2020-10-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Haven’t had a chance to use it yet but I know it’s going to be awesome
597,5.0,2021-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I gave this a 5 star rating based on the money spent for the unit and how much Breville is able to pack into it. It's not top of the line for home baristas. Neither is it entry level. I think the shots you pull will reflect that. I've used Intelligentsia and Counter Culture Coffees, both freshly roasted. I’ve pulled really good shots but probably not great ones (I say “probably b/c opinions differ on what a great shot is). Every shot, even those extracted at 25-28 sec. perfectly in the range, still has some bitterness. If you are going to make mostly milk-based drinks, I think the machine is spot on, given the price, and you don’t have the pull “the perfect shot”. The grinder is quite sufficient for such drinks. However, if you’ll be downing straight shots of espresso, it will take some dialing in; and frankly, I’m not sure you can pull that local-barista level shot on this machine. Then again, maybe it’s just me! All in all, I’m very pleased with the purchase and have spent the last week playing with it and pulling tons of good shots. I definitely recommend it as a kind of intermediate experience.

Also a note about Amazon- My wife initially ordered this for me as a gift. When the unit arrived the pump was dead out of the box! However, she got on the phone with Amazon, explained the situation and they overnighted me another that was here the next day. Worked perfectly. Excellent customer service!"
598,5.0,2022-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I saved up to buy this and am so glad I did! Buy good espresso and it’s worth it in flavor, this machine is a beast!"
599,2.0,2021-08-08, Black Sesame,"We have had espresso machines for about ten years now. The ones we used were half the price of this one, and they had no bean grinder incorporated. However, they did make a very decent espresso, with a great head of crema on it every time.
In comes this machine: Breville Barista. I watched several instruction videos on youTube, to make sure we did it right. However, there was no way we could get the pressure of draw to rise: it just stayed 1/8 of an inch near the starting point of the needle. No crema what. so. ever..... the coffee was tepid to say the least. We timed the priming and draw times, we adjusted the grind size, all the way to 100% fine even. It did not make a difference. We pre-heated the machine to get it to make a hotter cup of coffee.... no difference. We threw away a bunch of grinds of fresh beans, just to make sure what was left in the grinder chute would be the last setting of the grind parameter, same outcome. My stomach turned sour from all the coffee tasting of all the brew runs, and I couldn't take it anymore. We both (hubby and I) have not time in our lives to make adjusting the espresso machine a life-long mission or a hobby. We just want to prep a draw of espresso, hit the draw button and enjoy it before going to the office. No time for lengthy experiments. A 700 $ machine that is THAT finicky is just not what I fancy.
Who knows... maybe this one is malfunctioning... maybe... but when watching the myriad of how-to videos on the tube, one can already guess that this is not a simple learning curve. We are returning this purchase for a refund."
600,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s nice looking on the counter…Super easy to clean…my husband loves it!!
601,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have had this machine for over two years, you keep it clean and it works for you without fail! I’ve not had a product that I am this happy with in a very long time! I wanted to wait to write a review to see about its longevity. We make at least four double shot espresso’s per day and then when we have company... who knows how many shots this machine has accomplished! We have saved tons of money and love not giving Starbucks our money. Quite honestly if this machine completely breaks and is unfixable we will buy another one! My sister has purchased two-one for her home and one for her cabin because of the coffee I made her 2 Thanksgivings ago. My husband fixed a minor leak that we were having but this did not happen until after two years and thousands of cups of coffee. 👍"
602,5.0,2022-03-02, Black Sesame,"I am delighted with this machine. There is a bit of a learning curve (or perhaps comfort factor) but it is well worth it to hear my wife say ""this is as good as any cappuccino I've had in Italy."" I had an issue early on since I was not getting the right espresso pressure range when brewing but a very helpful and knowledgeable Breville customer service rep walked me through the process and I've had no problems since. Turns out I was using the wrong filter.

The funny thing is that I don't really drink cappuccino although my wife loves it. Maybe I like being il barista italiano per la bella turista americana. I'm still working on the right proportions to make caffe americano the way I like it."
603,2.0,2022-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have had a silver coffee Breville in Australia, previously to this one, for more than 2 years and it has never happened. Now, after using it for 2 or 3 weeks the colour is already coming out"
604,5.0,2022-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine - it's no professional machine, but it's as close as a personal machine needs to be. Highly customizable, easy to use even for beginners, and will cut your Starbucks budget down to only coffee runs at work when you're away from this machine. It... it's paid for itself.

It's also fun to entertain and be able make everyone their own special drink. It's a machine that's just uncommon enough people still are eager to let you show it off.

The only reason I had to return the one I bought is because my sister bought it for me before it came in."
605,5.0,2020-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent
606,5.0,2022-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,We’ve been using this espresso machine consistently for two years. It’s awesome and easy to use. Great value for the Price!
607,5.0,2020-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"While I was heating up my Bes870Xl to make a cup of oatmeal, i figured Id write a review. Yes, i warmed it up for oatmeal. The hot water dispenser can be used for anything needing hot water in a flash.

The main review on this amazing machine is that its just a BEAST. Quite frankly, Im horrible on everything that I own. Cars, tools, appliances. Ive come to terms with it by buying quality with anything. The BES870XL is just that. Quality. I run this thing 2+times a day sometimes exceeding that. Ive ran it dry QUITE a few times. Id say close to 10 times. It still worked. A pump burned up from it eventually(which was 100% my fault), but a replacement was easy to trqck down. Brevilles customer service is also quality. This machine can whip up some froth using steam quite quickly once you get a few froths under your belt. My only gripe is simply that I cant drink any other coffee unless its ran through the BES870XL. i recommend it 10/10

Hope this review helps someone get quicker oats like me.
Matt"
608,4.0,2021-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had my Barista Express about a year now and it has been a solid machine. I make coffee usually 4x a week. No problems with the machine. Only issue I have found is that its hard to get a good shot using the single filter basket. Usually end up with an over-extraction, but with some tweaking you can get it pretty close."
609,5.0,2022-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my first purchase for such a machine. I got tired of paying $10/day for my coffee habit at Starbucks. The machine came packed very professionally. I got the chrome look and it is very clean and sleak. Looks great in the kitchen. I've been using the machine now for over a month. I bought coffee identical to what they use at Starbucks and other coffee shops.

The function and taste of the coffee coming from this machine is outstanding, identical to the $15K machines they use at most coffee shops. I'm so happy with it. I make 2 to 3 cups of coffee everyday and that doesn't include the rest of my family. We are using the machine at least 4 times/day without any problems.

The cups of coffee (1 and 2 expresso shots) are consistent every time. We have experimented with flavored coffee and also our own pumpkin spice flavorings with superior results.

I think the key is to use the machine EXACTLY how the manufacturer asks. I put in only bottled water and always clean the steamer wand and clean the machine after every use. The machine is extremely easy to clean. I would highly recommend this machine if you enjoy coffee as much as I do."
610,4.0,2016-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes good espresso overall and is a welcome addition to my kitchen. However, Breville fixed the 1st one under warranty (1 year) but a few years later it's dead again (2 years later). I ended up buying the part necessary to fix it the 2nd time (bad solenoid valve- $60). Breville offered to fix it for me but the return process was going to be nearly 2+ weeks and I would have had to have sourced a suitable box and packaging to send it back since they were ""out of stock"" of boxes to send me. Took me about an hour to fix and not something terriblly simple, but definitely doable for a DIY type if willing/capable. I hate things that don't last and end up in the landfill, so I'm glad parts were available."
611,5.0,2022-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I very recently bought this machine after a lot of research, trying to decide what would be my best investment. Prior to this I had a DeLonghi machine that I also like very much, but wanted to upgrade to a machine that had a built-in burr grinder..

As I make espresso at least every morning if not more, I decided to purchase machine based on large amount of positive feedback. And I was not disappointed!

Very easy to set up, with a small learning curve to pull a shot that is within the range on the gauge on the front of the machine. Fantastic learning experience, which has resulted in pulling a perfect shot every time.... There are many instructional videos on YouTube that were very helpful, in addition to the instructions that came with the machine.

Very happy I decided to go ahead with the purchase, plan to have this machine for a number of years 🙂"
612,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Just a little noisy!
613,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If your need for coffee is real, this is your go to for home Barista action"
614,5.0,2020-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,My unit arrived after cleaning the parts and getting it ready for use I noticed that something had poked a hole in the box and my water tank had a crack. Amazon Customer Support was great. I went ahead and filled it up and began my first espresso and milk steaming. This unit does not have a double boiler so it is going to take some time since you cant pull a shot and steam your milk at the same time. Suggest you steam the milk first then pull the shot as a shot will die if left after 30 seconds. First experience was amazing and we are completely satisfied with this machine. It steams great micro foam and pulls a very good shot. I would suggest you do your homework and watch youtube on this machine it will help you adjust. It takes time to get things locked in but it makes great coffee our next machine with be the oracle touch. This is a great starter machine
615,2.0,2013-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"No matter how much I increase the temp (via YouTube video) it is warm. If adjust temp too high, the coffee is bitter. Steaming the milk too long in order to heat up the espresso scalds the milk. Would def buy a diff machine"
616,5.0,2021-03-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Its great. You can make whatever they do at Starbucks with a little practice.

Honing in on the best grind size and amount is tricky.. 3 stars out of 5 for that. We tried a new brand and had to change both settings before we got it dialed in again, but whoopty doo because your saving so much money per you can waste a double shot a day and still come out ahead.

Beans for single or doubleshot , milk (steamed or cold), flavored syrup, whip cream, carmel/chocolate = ~20 bucks and gets you at least 10 drinks depending on how heavy you pour on the carmel.
20 bucks gets you like 4-5 drinks at Starbucks
This think will pay for itself after a year of ditching to-go coffee"
617,5.0,2022-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I LOVE my machine! It’s perfect for me. I miss it when I travel. The quality of the espresso is on par with a professional machine, perfect for at home use. I would highly recommend making the investment in this machine. It’s easy to use though I recommend reading all instructions prior to use. Beware: It can be loud during extraction, frothing, and grinding. It’s definitely louder than a regular coffee maker. I’m very pleased."
618,5.0,2021-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The best home system for the price! I have calculated the payback savings at around 185 double-shots and have made these before reviewing. The model allows great fine tuning of grind, pour pressure (through cups and grind amount) and volume of pour. The pour itself is rich and creamy and the steamer makes cafe grade microfoam that is the hallmark of a professional latte or cappuccino. I could not be more thrilled.

As a non-integrated system, it does require a purge of pressure that requires tray emptying, but clean up is easy and system cleaning is mostly automatic. The YouTube tutorials are very helpful. I love this machine!!"
619,5.0,2022-07-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was using my bank's ""expenses tracking feature"" and found out that I spend at least $6-7 worth of coffee almost everyday....thats more than $2000 every year! (and thats a conservative estimate). I bought this when it was on sale, also bought a 5-pound coffee bag that will keep me happy for the next 3 months. At $80 per 5-pound bag every 2-3 months, I will be saving a whopping $1500+ a year! Besides the fact that you are saving a ton of money, you get to pull your own shots. That means you can customize the taste of your coffee(more/less bitter, sweet, acidic etc.). As soon as I dialed it in to my preference, I have been pulling shots that tastes better than any of the coffee shops that I frequently visit."
620,1.0,2016-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a more critical follow-up to my earlier favorable review. Here's the earlier review first:

Bought this when the Krups automatic espresso machine failed once again and once too often.This is a better machine--allows you to customize espresso temperature, and allows you to steam the milk to the temperature you want, which the Krups did not. Also, it's quite inexpensive for a machine of this caliber--a hundred dollars less than the Krups, and largely stainless steel instead of the Krups' plastic. Kudos to Amazon for allowing me to return the Krups after almost a year had passed. They asked me to explain why I thought this was appropriate, and when I did they accepted my explanation. Such a good company. Not perfect (hey, what happend to the photos in my Kindle edition of The New York Times?), but so much better than most U.S. corporations these days. As a small private investor, I generally avoid individual stocks--too volatile--and buy index funds, but I'm holding on to my Amazon.

And now the follow-up:

I continue to be amazed at the consistency of Amazon's customer service. Now for some bad news about my Breville: Quite predictably, and no fault of Breville's, I have to bring in my machine for service once or twice a year. The water here in LA is really hard on espresso machines. I've lived here for 16 years now and its affected every machine I've owned. To date, I've have gone through $10,000 worth of espresso machines and I think my experience is probably not too far from average. However, the last time I brought in my machine -- amazingly there's only one company, Primo Espresso, that services these machines in Los Angeles -- they told me they'd service it so far as cleaning went, but that if it needed parts they wouldn't do the service. Why? Because their experience has been that getting parts from Breville is unpredictable and often takes weeks. This, understandably, pisses off Primo Espresso's customers who blame them for the delays. They've had enough.

When you look at all the Breville reviews of all their machines, you'll find plenty of 5 star reviews -- they're good machines and as functional as any other good espresso machine (this is a fairly low bar, however -- these things are like 70s era Ferraris, all of them -- beautiful to look at, expensive to keep up and prone to eventual terminal failure). But when you look at the one star reviews, you'll see that service has been a continuing problem. Unfortunately, if the authors of some of these outraged reviews are even close to right, Breville hasn't taken ownership of this problem. In fact, one employee seems to have decided that Breville owners are enemies who need to be defeated.

I'm forwarding this review to Breville for several reasons. First, I want them to repair the relationship with Primo Espresso. If they don't I won't be able to keep my Breville and a lot of LA area Breville owners are going to be really upset with Breville. Which brings me to my second reason: I've been a musician most of my life but in the process have owned small businesses -- recording studio, jingle house and television scoring business. So I know: being a small businessperson is really hard and if you don't get it right you go down the tubes. My San Francisco recording studio, Different Fur, is one of only two or three Bay Area recording studios (out of hundreds) left from the 60s. The only reason its still there is that I really paid attention to my customers. Eventually I sold the studio, but the following owners were all of the same mind. Patrick Brown, who owns it now, works at the business with unbelievable energy, treats all his clients like longlost friends and the business continues to thrive. What I see when I look at Breville is a company with good products whose reputation is in decline because of a single problem -- customer service. If they don't address it, eventually it'll kill them off. So I hope they understand that this problem has to be addressed. If they do, by the way, I'll add to this review and tell you so. If you see nothing further, the problem's still there and I wouldn't recommend buying a Breville machine."
621,5.0,2022-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had it for almost 2 weeks now: it’s a thing of beauty. The design is simple and thorough, the finish is top notch, and it works great. To be clear, this is a fully manual espresso maker. It’s not at all like a vending machine where you just press a button. If you want that go with a Nespresso (but you’ll be paying a lot for the pods, and you still need to steam the milk somehow). This machine is about as close as you’re going to get to a full fledged industrial machine, but for a fraction of the price. You’re going to need to invest some time and patience to learn how to use it. But the results are fantastic! It’s like having a coffee shop in your own home. Highly recommended!"
622,5.0,2021-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Estoy enamorada de mi Breville es muy fácil manejar y programar. Da un buen café que queda exquisito, y espumoso el molino para el café trabaja súper bien. Muy fácil para limpiarla, creo que hice una buena inversión!"
623,5.0,2018-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I worked as a barista for 10+ years, so I love coffee. When COVID started I knew going to the coffee shop was out of the equation for me, so when I moved back in with my parents for a few months I ordered this model after going back and forth between a few options. It has kept us sane and caffeinated while quarantined. I'm bringing my machine with me when I move out next month, but my parents were able to learn on this and I've ordered them one so they can continue to have espresso drinks and reduce going out and risking covid exposure. I've been making 3-4 drinks a day for the past 5 months and its worked great, no issues, only required one deep clean per its sensor."

625,4.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame," Leak update
My mistake...There was NO leakage!

What I though was a leak is a normal pressure release mechanism. No ""leak"" will be happen as long as the tray is in place.
Found out about it while reviewing more tutorials and troubleshooting videos.
Got unit out of the box and made myself a double sot.
I just cancelled return.
Thanks Amazon for great service!!

What a shame ... after so much time spent reading reviews from Amazon and other online pundits this was a poor selection!
Barista was delivered on January 19th.
I followed all instructions and setup steps.
Read users manual.
Used Lavazza súper crema - also highly recommended.
Used Breville only an average of 3 times per week.
Followed all steps and kept it clean after each use...

Well, today, March 3rd, it started leaking water from the bottom while I was purging the shower screen!
It leaked every time I turned the power on. Just like that.

Contacted Amazon, got a return label, and this unit will be on its way ASAP!"
626,5.0,2022-03-27, Black Sesame,"I bought this acceptable from amazon thinking it might have scratches and be a bit ugly but it looked absolutely new. Came with every item and they looked new, no scratches in the machine.

As for the machine itself I love it, I did have to look up videos in youtube as I am more of a visual learner but love it once you understand it. My main problem was the pressure but found a video how to adjust the setting and needed to change my grains to something more fresh. Would recommend if you love coffee and want an expresso machine."
627,5.0,2021-08-13, Black Sesame,"This is my very first expresso machine. I've had it for about three weeks and I am thrilled with it. After a few tweaks to grind (Lavazza Super Crema) and tamp, you can really make a great shot with a nice extraction. The steam arm is easy to use (as noted by others, it pulses and the output is loud sounding in the milk frother at first then it quiets down) and produces awesome foamed anything (whole, 2%, almond milk). As others have noted, after using the steam arm, the machine will then release what seems to be quite a bit of excess pressure/water into the bottom collection bin (but no worries). I've read other posts and I was somewhat concerned about the longevity of the machine so I bought the protection plan (hoping to get at least 4 years out of the total spend but really hoping for more and only time will tell). So far so good...but a word of caution...if you buy this machine (or any expresso machine) you will likely be the designated family barista and your drink will inevitably be the last made and you'll be stuck with the clean-up (but hey, I'd be stuck with the clean up if I was alone on my own). So far I'm very pleased with the purchase. Enjoy!!"
628,3.0,2020-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When you get it to work right it makes a nice espresso or cappuccino. When purchasing an $800 espresso machine I guess I was naïve to think it would make brewing simple. First you need to use whole beans so it can grind it, if not, other machines grind will not get the pressure up high enough to brew it correctly. Second, once you have a the correct grind you have pack and shave so much of the coffee off the top of the portafilter you're wasting coffee."
629,5.0,2022-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this for my Dad for Christmas in 2016. After two and a half years of constant use it still performs flawlessly. He drinks at least a dozen shots of espresso daily so this machine helps reduce his daily trips to the coffee shop and saves him money. My Dad does not like fussy electronics or anything remotely complicated but this Breville has been a piece of cake for him right out of the box. He didn’t even ask for help to set it up. He made me a double shot americano this morning and I have to say it makes some fantastic espresso really quickly. I’m thinking about buying one for myself.

***Update January 2020***
I finally bought a Breville Barista Express for myself. I’m very pleased with the ease of use and how consistent the shots are. I did watch some tips and tricks on YouTube to help me out. There are some good videos out there. And after all this time my Dad’s machine is still working flawlessly."
630,3.0,2021-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Overall I like the concept of being able to make my own cappuccino and I definitely got sold on the appearance .. looks impressive. Figuring out just the right combination to make the perfect cup? Well , you can go through a lot of coffee, even after watching the utube videos.... My biggest complaint, and there is a complaint, is the knob on the side that controls the steam. Very very difficult to move.. its extremely stiff and most of time when I try to dial it back to the neutral position I have to do it with my left hand (not my dominant hand) and I get this shooting pain in my hand.. It’s very difficult to turn. Even with my right hand its tough. One more little tid bit.. I think should and can be improved on, is the loud noise it makes during any kind of preparation, wether frothing or brewing. It’s loud.."
631,5.0,2020-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this because of COVID and not I don't need to go out to enjoy a great coffee. I've tried different beans and I had to tun the amount i get out from the machine but the flavor is really good.
I even enjoy making my own coffee and cappuccino, I thought it was a little expensive but it worth the money, I just hope it last a long time, I've been taking care of maintenance so I hope it will."
632,5.0,2022-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this as a gift six months ago for my boyfriend who’s a coffee addict and he loves it! It took a while for us to figure out how to use it well but after watching some YouTube tutorials we’ve become a lot better at dialing in different beans. Flavor wise it’s better than the coffee you usually get at a coffee shop. We also highly recommend buying beans at your local coffee roasters versus Starbucks and other beans in grocery stores. Having fresh roasted beans makes all the difference. This machine has also saved us a lot money. He drinks coffee 3-5 times a week before work and when coffee can cost $4-6 a cup it really adds up.
633,4.0,2019-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Coffee's fine for my purposes. My biggest complaint: we have 18"" between our counter top and the underside of our upper cabinet and this is where we need to keep the machine.

In order to access the water tank for refilling - for us about once a week - I need to pull the machine (23 pounds) out from under the cabinet and rotate it 180 degrees. This might not be the best machine for anyone who might find that difficult... or annoying."
634,4.0,2019-12-28, Black Sesame,"Pros
- solid build quality with stainless steel she'll and hard plastic internal structure
- built in grinder is very convenient with 16 different settings from coarse to fine
- built in pressure gauge makes it easier to track and fine tune shots
- can be used with very little adjustement to start off, but there are a lot of settings to play with as one gets more invested in espresso making. Temp and shot duration can be adjusted to finesse shots
- knobs and dials are large and easy to adjust
- magnetic tamper fits into machine and is easily accessible
- frother secured via a ball and socket joint and can freely rotate 360 degrees

Cons
- excess water trap tends to fill up quite quick after heating and cleaning shots
- grinder cover doesn't fit securely and doesn't seem like it creates an adequate seal to keep coffee beans fresh
- water tank width is narrow making hand washing difficult. It is however dishwasher friendly
- slightly on the pricey side for a starter espresso machine."
635,5.0,2019-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Beautiful design, looks great in the kitchen and not too big. Getting the pressure right to brew the espresso correctly was tricky, but the instructions are really helpful. Just takes some practice. Really high quality machine and premium feeling tools. The automatic coffee grinder is by far the best feature of this whole thing. Was pleasantly surprised by how easy the entire machine is to clean as well. The tray components come apart with almost no hassle and can be rinsed in the sink in seconds. The black sesame version is a deep glossy black by the way, not matte."
636,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After reading g rave reviews of the Barista Express, I took the plunge when it went on sale for $600. Long story short, I just don’t have the time a semiautomatic machine takes to produce consistent shots. Even with the pressurized portafilter, it was hit and miss. OTOH, the milk steaming is excellent. Silky smooth microfoam is not hard to achieve.
I returned this machine for a Phillips 3200 with the regular steam wand. I know it won’t be the best espresso but it will be OK and very reproducible for me and also the wife and family."
637,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have owned this machine for 13 years and have probably brewed well over 10,000 double shots of espresso. With two daily users this has been the best investment to date. Even after my steam wand went out 3 years ago, the main unit is still going strong. Just get a $30 frother on Amazonr; please don't toss the machine. Milk frother is easier to clean anyhow than the steam wand and less effort. We don't even clean it regularly as suggested and it still brews a wonderful espresso. I would HIGHLY recommend this unit to anyone who is a serious espresso/latte drinker. We could not live without this unless we lived inside a coffee house. LOL Don't hesitate on this one. Beans are another thing but we like to buy the 2 lb. Lavazza Super Crema. We found this works great with the Breville."
638,5.0,2016-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ditch your keurig. Ditch your pour-over funnel. Ditch your drip coffee. It’s time to step up into real coffee. I bought this for my wife and I because we drop serious cash at coffee shops like Starbucks and Caribou. We no longer need to go there at all! Pair this machine with some of your favorite Torani syrups and you’ll be making professional-grade lattes at home for years to come. This machine is very well-built. It can withstand multiple uses per day, and makes truly professional-grade coffee. Easy to use, and there are tons and tons of videos on YouTube for you to perfect the craft."
639,5.0,2019-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Investment purchase for us. Before my Breville I use to buy cappuccino at Starbucks once a week. After noticing I was increasing my Starbucks trips to more than once, I calculated that purchasing an espresso machine was actually going to save me money. It took me a little bit of time to figure out how to perfect my lattes and cappuccinos but it’s been a great addition to our home. It’s easy to clean, and 2 years later it’s working like day 1. I don’t ever regret purchasing mine here. It’s been so good that after bragging about it my friends and family have purchased one too."
640,5.0,2022-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is a game changer. You can make the perfect espresso or latte. It's easy enough to use. Do yourself a favor and purchase a thermometer as well, milk should not go past 150 degrees (or it burns). There is a you tube video on this machine and it's great!! When you change beans, adjust the settings. Enjoy!"
641,5.0,2021-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ordered this machine back in June of 2018 after returning from a European vacation where we absolutely fell in love with great tasting americano and espresso. We've been using this machine multiple times a day for the more than 2 years now that we've owned the machine. With a bit of regular cleaning, it continues to make amazing tasting coffee (americano, espresso, latte, cappuccino) to this day, and the taste keeps getting better as we become more experienced/skilled as an ""at home barista."" You can completely tailor the taste to what you like. There are tons of videos online to pick up on tips that others have found. Completely satisfied with the quality and performance of this machine."
642,5.0,2017-12-30, Black Sesame,"Update: I have had my machine for almost 2 years now and if I could give it more stars I would! I would buy it again and again if I needed to but of course it is just as perfect as the day I bought it with heavy use daily for almost 2 years. I make between 2-5 lattes daily and they are absolutely perfect everytime. The cleaning systems are easy 👌 I have worked in coffee shops before and the only difference in my opinion is that you have to fill the water reservoir ... Which in my opinion is a really easy task for such great results. my good friend even bought herself one because she loved mine so much !
I absolutely love this espresso machine ❤️❤️ it's just like having a professional machine at home. My last espresso machine was a decent at home latte maker that served it's purpose but this guy 😍☕👌 worth every single penny and more!"

646,4.0,2022-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine and easy to use. Just figuring out how to make a consistent cup! Needs to be turned on and warmed up... well packed, add more grinded beans into a shot. Single seems to be more reliable than a double... but overall excellent!"
647,3.0,2022-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine does what it states, and does it well. Only complaint is after spending over $600 on a machine, one would expect it to be complete. The holding part for the tamper is missing. Called Breville, and they want entire machine repackaged and returned to get a small magnet installed. Machine works well, just disappointed with lack of assembly QA."
648,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Decided to purchase an in home espresso machine after doing the math and figuring out I spent well over $2,000 a year at Starbucks in one year. Had a colleague that owned this exact model and he loved it. Finally purchased one myself and I couldn’t be happier. Although the instructions are good, the best bit of advice is from the lady on YouTube doing a product review along with another video showing tips on how to use the machine from the grinder, all the way to the steamer. Cleanup can be a pain but I’ve come across my own techniques for things like cleaning the steam wand at the end. For example, after steaming your milk, place the wand under the hot water port and run hot water over the wand, using the stainless steel cup as a catcher. After running the hot water over the wand, immediately wipe off and you’re done. I really like this purchase. Highly recommend."
649,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We are loving this machine. The coffee comes out great! Right from the first time we used it.
The milk comes out awesome too. Better than on the super-fancy machine we have at work.
As others have said, you do need to be committed to buy one of these. It does take some time to get your cup of coffee from start to finish. I agree that the machine is kind of loud, but I don't think it is unique to this machine. The grinding is loud....and getting the right pressure to get the creamy coffee requires some ""umpph"" from the machine too. If you live in a small apartment with roommates that like to sleep in, they might not like it. I think it looks nice and is easy to clean up. We feel very satisfied."
650,5.0,2022-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine emantes quality. Quick start up. Materials are top of the line. You can customize your bean water with the single wall filters or straight to perfect espresso with the double walls, regardless of bean grind. It’s pricey and I don’t know how the machine will hold up so I locked in the 4 year warranty. I drink espresso multiple times a day, almost every day. The clean cycle is very simple and will alert you. Spend the cash and buy this dream machine for your finest beans."

This is easily one of the best purchases I've ever made! All I did was keep up with the routine descaling, and cleaned the grinder once a year. It grind the beans consistently, and custom program for extraction time is perfect, and it makes me feel cool to make coffee for my guests!"
653,4.0,2022-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my Breville espresso machine! It is beautiful! I've not operated an espresso machine for many years so it's definitely a learning curve but I sure do enjoy the process. I'm one happy camper! :)

What I am unhappy about and causes reason for concern is the fact that the shipping box was badly damaged and heavily taped together. The exterior of the machine does not show any damage but I am concerned that possibly connections in the assembly might have become compromised, loosened or may otherwise cause the unit for falter in the near future. Luckily I purchased the extended warranty if that happens I'll be covered.
It is disappointing that folks in the shipping department do not give a rats ass about the packages they are responsible for. SMH"
654,5.0,2021-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine replaced a much simpler and not very good Krups. It is almost perfect at what it's designed for, but required a bit of trial and error before I gained proficiency. I use it every day for anywhere from 2 to 4 beverages. It is marvelously engineered and very well made, and is also attractive. It's easy to use and provides enough customization of functions for anyone to make their ideal brew. The hidden tool tray is a nice plus, as is the easy to fill water tank. I'm not a coffee snob and would never consider paying $300 or higher for a grinder, so I am more than pleased with the one on this machine and find that between grind size and grind amount adjustments, it more than fills my needs. The milk frothing wand performs well, though my technique needs fine tuning before I will be creating any distinctive cappuccino art. The gauge is definitely a worthwhile aid in achieving the combination of correct grind and tamp pressure essential to a good cup. Having a hot water spout right there is handy, and I find cleanup to be quite effortless. I watched prices on this for a year and bought it on a significant 1 day price drop, but I would have eventually bought it before too long anyway."
655,2.0,2021-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This coffee machine worked well for 18 months and then the water pump went out. Like some others have reported, when the pump went out, water just dripped out of the head with no pressure. Fortunately, I purchased extended warranty insurance from Asurion, and sent it in for repair (they paid for the UPS return label). After about four weeks, Asurion said that they couldn’t repair the machine. They refunded me my original purchase price into my Amazon account (before taxes). Unfortnately, the price of the machine has now gone up $100 since 18 months ago. So it cost me probably $130-$140 between taxes and insurance to use the coffee machine for 18 months. Not great, but at the same time not sure there are better options in the market in this price range. So I may purchase again, but I will probably puchase with extended warranty thing again. And I never purchase product warranty stuff, but somehow I have always had bad luck with water pumps and coffee machines after 2-5 years."
656,5.0,2021-07-27, Black Sesame,"I've never posted a review but felt the need to share. This is AMAZNING. I went from a $100 dollar delonghi to this. I thought the Delonghi was okay but my main issue was that I needed to always have fresh beans. After not even a month, I needed to get new beans-- so I thought replacing with this would be perfect and it is. Fresh cup every time. The pressure gauge is amazing. You will not be disappointed. My sister has been convincing me to get this model for years. This most definitely will save me money in the future. I'm so excited.

Also note * I got a used ""good."" condition model from Amazon Warehouse and it was literally brand new with $200 off. So glad!!"
657,5.0,2021-12-30, Black Sesame,"The more I use this machine the more I love it. It’s very cleverly designed from the automatic grinder which holds your portafilter securely, to the secret compartment underneath for tool storage that is drawn out as you pull out the water catch. I can make a 4 shot drink in less than 5 minutes which is almost faster than brewing a pot of coffee, and much more convenient than driving to a coffee shop.
It’s saves me so much money too because I’m not out buying coffee or energy drinks. It’s one of the best purchases I’ve made on Amazon, thanks Breville!"
658,5.0,2019-11-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Coffee snob here. I've been tasting, testing for the best coffee most of my life. Still tasting but can't blame the maker any longer. It all started 50 years ago as a hippie in Negril and blue mountain bliss struck. Mr coffee, Senseo, French press, Aeropress, Drip, Perc, Keurig, Nespresso some almost there but none just right, until now. The Breville Barista definitely needs some tuning but when correct perfect dosage every time. Breva, Latte, Cappucino and espresso all heavenly, over and over. Downside, coffee anywhere but home is tasteless."
659,2.0,2021-10-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a love hate relationship. I purchased the Breville BES870XL in late Nov 2015 as my first ""serious"" espresso machine. As many reviews indicated, it did take about a month to play with it and learn to make a good cup of coffee. Things I learned along the way. Getting a good fresh bean is important. Arabica is the best choice. Grind is important. Coarseness of grind and packing effect the pressure you get in the gauge. All of this is more important than the length of draw. At least when you are first learning. Sometimes too much information just muddies the water...so to speak. After a month or so, I could make a better latte or mocha than my local coffee stand, or at least we thought so. LOVED this machine!!! Since we had been spending significant money at that stand, the breville paid for itself pretty quickly.

Now for the not so good. I cleaned the Breville devotedly according to the maintenance instructions on the Breville USA website. But even with consistent decalcifying and regular cleaning, I started having trouble around March. There was a loud buzzing noise at the beginning of the espresso cycle sometimes it would stop fairly quickly and the shot would pull. Other times not and I would have to shut off the machine and start over. A google search showed that this seemed to be an issue with these machines and sometimes repeating the cleaning cycle helped. So I did about 3-4 successive cleans. Yay! It seemed to help. I also switched to bottled water to help prevent further calcium build up. Ultimately, this turned out to be just a band aid and the buzzing was soon back. I called Technical assistance and they were very friendly and helpful. I mentioned that there seemed to be some information online about a common issue and the Tech support person replied that ""Well, there IS a valve..."" Hmmm. I would agree...yes there is a problem with these machines. On another note...Some of the reviews have stated that support promptly sent a new machine. As of spring 2016 this is no longer true. The customer assistance person informed me they were no longer replacing machines Breville sent me free packing materials and instructions to send my machine to Ohio where it was repaired and returned to me. It took about a week to go from western US to Ohio. Three days turn around at the factory and then several more days back to me. When the machine was returned there was still a very brief buzz at the beginning of the espresso cycle. But a check list was included saying everything had been cleaned and adjusted to ""specifications"". And it seemed to be working again. At least that was good. Now it is mid September I have been using this machine to consistently brew 1 to 2 cups of coffee per day and cleaning it regularly per instructions. It is broken again. It is currently putting too much water into the froth when trying to steam milk. Apparently this can be another issue with these machines. It is still under warranty and this will be my second call for service. On a good note...it has paid for itself in latte savings...and it was the least expensive of the machines we looked at. Good starter machine. I sure expected it to last longer though. I will get it repaired under the existing warranty and will use it until it breaks and can't be repaired further. Then will definitely look at something other than a Breville."
660,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Below is my original review.
I have now owned mine for 4 years, still works great.
But a word to the designers: What are you thinking with the drip tray???? There are so many nooks and crannies that it is impossible to clean. There are compartments that you can't even get into without long q-tips.
And my water compartment leaks if I fill it up past 1/2 way.
Other than that, it does make great espresso, and it's been working daily 3 times or so for 4 years, so it's a good machine...

Original post from 3 years ago:

Love it!
I've previously owned the super high end ($$) Breville, and it worked great. The heating up time was maddeningly slow for my first caffeine blast in the morning, and then it was severely injured in a cross country move, so I pondered/researched/thought about a new one for a long time.
I was attracted to the all in one aspect of this one.

And I love it.
Grinds great, dispensed grounds perfectly, warms up super quickly, and makes a damn fine espresso.

The downsides are it get messy quickly (from grinds mostly), and it only holds a small amount of water.

The rest is great.
In fact, I think I'll go have another blast this morning."
661,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fantastic machine but you need to have skills to brew right espresso 🤪
662,5.0,2021-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I was a barista for a few years many years ago. My only regret is not buying this machine sooner. We’ve owned this a couple months and my wife and I serve up 4 to 6 drinks daily. It consistently pulls amazing crema and flavor when you use freshly roasted quality beans. Steam wand works great. Grinder is excellent. Very easy to adjust to both the amount and the coarseness. Great value for the money when you consider all these parts are included. Cleaning is easy. Very very happy customer.
663,5.0,2020-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,So easy to use and so satisfying to make a cup of coffe exactly the way you want it.
664,5.0,2020-08-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is semiautomatic but allows for tweaking in for your personal taste. With that said, there will be be a learning curve which will be well worth it."
665,5.0,2018-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was buying a white chocolate Americano most days at one of our local coffee stands. While delicious I was spending a lot of money doing that and often had to wait in long lines to boot. I used my daughters Breville while on vacation together and just loved it. I had no experience making an espresso (prior to our vacation) but it was very easy to use and makes wonderful coffee - NO MORE COFFEE STANDS for me :) I drink mine iced, but my husband loves to froth milk and make a hot cup of coffee on the weekends using the Breville. We've had it about a month now with no issues."

668,5.0,2022-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My Mom had this machine first, and I liked it so much I bought one for myself. The inherent value of being able to make your own espresso at home is tantamount to pure joy and happiness. This machine does it all, and I couldn't be more pleased."
669,5.0,2018-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve used it every day since we bought it over one month ago! It’s a great value, easy to use and keep clean"
670,5.0,2022-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love having the all-in- one machine and I’m officially spoiled by my morning lattes. When we were shopping for espresso makers, this one came up time and again as a best value. I recommend looking at the cleaning/ flushing process and familiarizing yourself as it does take some monthly maintenance in addition to the daily cleaning. Well worth it though. I never thought we’d make that many espresso drinks, but in the few months we’ve had it, it has almost paid for itself compared to what we would have spent st the local coffee shop. Hints: Experiment with the grind size, coffee amount, etc. We had to grind much finer than anticipated bc we weren’t getting the pressure required at the beginning (coffee was under-expressed). I also highly recommend getting quality espresso beans. We tried one batch of regular coffee and it just came out tasting burnt and gross but the espresso beans we use make an excellent cup."
671,5.0,2015-06-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes the perfect expresso. However you need to follow the instructions and be prepared to experiment a bit at first to get a routine that suits you best. Several things need to be balanced such as the grind setting, amount of grind, the tamp pressure, freshness of coffee beans and type of beans used to get the correct expresso pressure. All of these sometimes need to be tweaked when a new packet of beans is used. When you get the balance right the results are outstanding .... goodbye Starbucks !! Be prepared though to accept that the pump in this machine has a finite number of cycles or lifetime depending on usage. My wife and I have a double expresso latte every morning without fail and have found that the pump usually last 2.5 to 3 years which is about 2000 shots of double expresso before failure (excluding cleaning cycles). How do I know this ? This is my 3rd machine !!! However to put it into perspective this works out at about 25 cents per cup over 3 years. Pretty good value overall. I'll be buying my 4th machine in 2020 !!"
672,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"I have had this machine for nearly a year now, and I am very pleased with my investment. When I calculated how much I was spending on lattes everyday, I realized that this would be a bargain in the long term, and it has turned out to be a great choice. It brews delicious, wonderful espresso in seconds--better than most restaurants and chain coffee shops. It did take me a while to get the hang of it. For several weeks, I could not seem to achieve the required pressure for optimal espresso. I kept getting low pressure and bitter drinks. But I persisted, trying several different brands and roasts of coffee, and finally discovered the right combination: you need a high quality, fresh, whole bean espresso roast that's not too dry and not too oily and it needs to be well tamped. I actually use a little rubber mallet to tamp mine because my arm strength just wasn't enough to get a nice firm tamp. Once I got that combination down, the pressure hit the correct zone, that wonderful aroma filled my kitchen, and the drinks are perfect. The machine is well crafted. I have had no maintenance issues with regular (several days per week) use. Would definitely recommend to any espresso lover."
673,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Both dual wall filters do not have any holes. So only 2 out of the 4 filters are useable. So far everything else is good. If the seller can send me the proper filters that would be great.
674,5.0,2021-10-01, Black Sesame,So far I love it! Easy to use. My 17 year old helped me set it up. So far its super easy to just do one cup of espresso and steam my soy milk. It's delicious! I don't have to add any sugar or anything. So good. Just like the coffee shops.

678,5.0,2022-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was a replacement for another BES807XL that had issues. I love the machines, which is the reason I bought another.

I would like to comment on Breville and their service. After I bought this one, I contacted Breville about the original and its issues. Although communications was a little slow (lots of emails), I can honestly say they were terrific about supporting their product. Long story short, I now have two BES870XLs that work great, which is fine since we have a second home where they can both be put to use.

Back to the 870XL. It has all the features of a much more expensive machine, but at a very reasonable price. The built in grinder is a must, it saves you on counter space and effort of having a stand-alone device. The steaming capability is solid, but you must realize it isn't a ""professional"" grade machine in that you can't steam milk for latte in a few seconds. Takes more like a minute....

Excellent espresso delivery, and pretty easy to clean.

Overall a great machine with very good features at a very reasonable price. Breville stands behind their products."
679,5.0,2022-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my second Breville Espresso Machine. The first was a Breville 800ESXL, bought in 2006, inspired me to love coffee and the ritual of pulling an espresso as a part of a healthy morning routine.

In 2012, after many years of use and many moves, in a transition, gave it to a friend. I've heard he was still using it over 10 years later, with no major issues.

A friend recommended the 870XL.

The machine is a pure joy.

But the service is what is incredible. The customer phone technicians at Breville are out of the Venice, CA area and are extremely knowledgeable. They were also quick to fix my situation.

A short time after my purchase on Amazon, it developed issues, and they provided a very nice box and label for me to ship it back. They repaired it the same day they received it and shipped it back. All in one day!

The machine came back meticulously packed and clean. It had a check list of maintenance that had been done. I feel like my unit is better than new.

Thanks Breville! I'm a 10 year customer.

Looking forward to the next 10."
680,3.0,2021-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Breville

I have to start with....I am sad to report my Breville BES870XL machine that I purchased July, 2016, quit working March, 2020. AND, I truly miss making my daily latte.

It was something to look forward to making everyday as I took care of my mom 24/7 for the last 7 years, as she bravely fought Alzheimer’s. Just one double shot, frothed almond milk, sprinkled with cinnamon, and I was energized!

She left this earthly home late February and after only a couple of weeks of me being able to be out of the house to socialize again, society basically “shut down” so I was right back where I’ve been for so many years, in the house unable to go out and help others. At least I could look forward to my daily latte. Well, at least I thought that would be the case.

So less than a month after mom passed, my awesome machine quit completely. I cried. I don’t know what happened. I always kept it cleaned, based on the instructions, but it quit anyway. That is why I have to give it a 3. It was a 5 for all these years, but I can’t afford to replace it."
681,5.0,2021-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had gone my entire life never owning an espresso machine - always thinking that they were incredibly expensive, difficult to use and messy. When my wife ""suggested"" that I buy one for our anniversary, I did my research and this machine came up. I read the reviews, watched videos, and then called my ""lifeline"" expert on coffee, and he told me that he had a very high-end Breville, and was very pleased with it, and based on my needs, the 870xl should be perfect.

Well - after less than 20 minutes of learning how to be a barista, I am now making the best coffee of my life and my wife couldn't be happier. Make sure to always use really good coffee - and despite the excellent filter, I'm electing to use bottled spring water because if you're going this far to make a good coffee - might as well use great water.

683,4.0,2020-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am an experienced home barista who owns a higher end Italian double boiler machine. Bought this for a second home. I had reservations about this purchase, but based on reviews and price bought this unit and was pleasantly surprised. The pressure gauge is very helpful in pulling a perfect shot, particularly in adjusting the grind. The lack of a double boiler is not as painful as I expected given the excellent programming of this machine. The steam is not very powerful, but the quality of the froth is excellent and easy to attain. There was a breaking in period for the grinder. At first it ground too fine and I was at the end of scale to obtain the proper grind. After a week or so the machine has seemed to break in and I have had to make a more coarse settings until I am now near the factory default. All in all I am most pleased with this purchase. The cappuccino is quite good, and the design is very thoughtful. Bravo Breville"
684,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really don’t know what took me so long to get one of these. Goodbye $5 cappuccinos! Used the Breville for the first time today. A bit intimidating at first when you visualize all the things that could go wrong, LOL! I spent a good long while reading the whole manual and following the prepping of the machine to the letter. Worth the time. The first cup is pictured here. I ran the 2-cup puck through twice to get the amount I wanted for a nice cup of cappuccino. Perfect nice brown foam on the espresso. The crema turned out perfectly with some cold skim milk. Delicious. Be sure to throw the cup you are going to use in the microwave with some hot water before you use it so your cup will be nice and hot. I’m sure to get faster at this! I would highly recommend this machine. Not the low end, not the high end but seems to be a well made product."
685,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's a beautiful machine, for starters. It is elegant, thoughtfully designed and made of high quality materials. After a few trial and errors, it produces THE most luxurious and creamy lattes and espressos. I used to own the Francis Francis x1 (the original, before the espresso pod only version) and the result was never as great as this. I am totally over the moon for this Breville and look forward to every morning for the opportunity to treat myself to the best latte I've ever had at home. It does take a few tries to get the setting right for your machine and the bean you use, but it doesn't take long.

*Only use fresh beans, pre-ground coffee is absolutely unworthy of this beast, as are pre-packaged coffee beans.

*Commit to using your razor in order to perfect your dosage for your pull every time...

The only thing I might have preferred was a dual boiler system so that my steam wand produces steam quicker and is always ready. That being said, it only takes about 30 seconds for the steam to prep. For a mid-range semi-automatic espresso machine (although higher end for me), it's worth absolutely every penny."
686,5.0,2022-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you’re looking for a unit that does everything for you and spits out a ready made coffee this machine isn’t for you. However If you’re after a quality coffee and are willing to learn how to make a good coffee by watching educational videos and how others use the machine, then this unit is definitely for you. It is well made and once you are familiar with its features you’ll find it well set up and produces excellent expresso coffees. I love it and use it every day (3 coffees) and it has never given any problems. If you are looking for a unit for low volume usage and one that allows you to tailor the process to suit your taste then this unit is for you. Advice. Always use fresh beans and preferably ones you’ve roasted yourself."
687,5.0,2013-12-29, Black Sesame,"We went on line and saw videos to get some tips on how to use it best.Then took a few hours playing with it one Sunday afternoon and that's all it took ! BYE BYE MORNING COFFEE STOP ! We now prefer the way WE make coffee now more than going out.Syrups are available on line or at our local grocery stores.
We Followed step by step their on line videos and within 30 min we were making great drinks ! I decided to use only bottle water to reduce the risk of hard water damaging the machine.This seems to be a mid level machine,Cost VS Value seemed best for us.
My only negative comment is not the machine sooner.Yep ,that I waited so long.Yes, Maybe it is more than I was prepared to spend and We Made it a present to Ourselves during the Holidays. But it is the one thing that we use EVERY DAY at least once.We joke about how can we bring it with us when we go camping,
I DO Have a Generator ... HUMMM .....Camping and Latte's that would make the wife happy."
688,5.0,2021-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Couldn’t be more satisfied with this purchase. Not only has it replaced us going to Starbucks (every morning) but the flavor and ease of use makes it even better. Only downside is cleaning can be a little daunting and hard to understand.
689,5.0,2021-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update from April 2022: I had this coffee machine and it is still going strong.

I waited for a year to write review, because one of my biggest concerns before buying was the durability. Good news: all parts still work as on day 1 and the coffee is great! It requires some learning curve and developing some intuition to achieve repeatable results, but it’s a lot of fun! We use it to make ~2 coffees every day.
I clean it every 2 months without waiting for the control to turn on.
The only thing I regret is not buying it earlier by like 10 years."
690,5.0,2022-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best purchase ever
691,5.0,2020-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am an owner of a coffee shop and have a $26,000 commercial machine in my business and in my home I use this machine it is absolutely wonderful"
692,2.0,2015-01-04, Black Sesame,"This was our first attempt at buying an Espresso machine. It had good reviews and high rating so we decided to try it. When it worked, it worked really well and was fun to use. We would have been completely satisfied and given it a 5-star rating but it didn’t last a month before it broke.

Normally when you press the 1-shot or 2-shot buttons there is a timer that automatically shuts off when the cup is filled with the correct amount of espresso. Unfortunately the auto shutoff failed and the cups would overflow making a mess. We could still work around that by using the stopwatch feature on our phones but that’s insane. For almost $700 this thing should work for years not days.

When I boxed this up to ship back I noticed it said “Made in China” on the bottom. I don’t know about your personal experiences with Chinese manufactured goods but in my experience the quality and reliability are usually poor. If this Espresso machine was reliable it would be brilliant, but it’s just been a disappointment for us. I hope you have better luck than we did.

PS,
We enjoyed making our own Latte’s so much that we went from ankle deep to neck deep and ordered a “Rocket Espresso Mozzafiato Timer Evoluzione R” made in Italy. It’s way more expensive but you get a Prosumer-class machine. The internals are neatly laid out with high quality copper piping and a rotary pump with insulated boiler assembled by someone in Italy who takes pride in their work. It comes with 5-year warranty. The Rocket is the Ferrari of Espresso machines!"
693,5.0,2021-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Tired of making quick pod and drip cups of coffee for the sake of stimulation, no expectations of tasting really good. Even purchased (several years ago) two Delongi, fully automatic, espresso machines, each lasted about 3 years; just too much to go wrong that requires an expensive trip back to the factory. This month I purchased the Breville BES870BSXL from Amazon. It arrived within two days, as promised. I am so pleased with it and myself, I am now ordering the second for a second location. It is automatic enough I don't have to re-invent the wheel. Knowing nothing about grinding, tamping, pressure, I'd always thought I couldn't do it. I unpacked my Breville and admired its beauty the first night. Following mid-day began reading and rereading the instructions. Couple of hours later began experimenting with a bag of unimportant beans. Another couple of hours later I was experiencing and understanding how to brew and steam and froth a cup of cappuccino to my surprised pleasure, and I would have proudly served it. Still some fine tuning to do on the grinding and tamping, yet I'm confident. Some times its really good to get fed up!"
694,4.0,2020-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love everything about it.
695,5.0,2020-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing machine, greate coffee tast. Can't wait to play around with it more!

Requires a bit of effort to maintain, clean and actually make coffee so it is for those who like to put more effort in making their coffee.

I havent had any of the issues people are complaining about yet. Hopefully I won't.

I am using fresh roasted beans ( 10 to 20 days old) at 6 or 5 grind setting with the amount of grind one step MORE than the middle setting for duel filter single walled basket, ground amount and extraction pressure is perfect. No mess at all.

Distance between drip tray and group head is ok for me, I use long cups sometimes for longblacks so the fit (more comfortably if I remove the metal top on the drip tray).

Filter baskets are hard to remove from the portafilter, maybe I dont know how yet.

The top of the machine does act as a heating surface for cups.

I used the water dispenser and it functions ok. No issue with its placement.

And thats it. I'll write more later."
696,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worth the investment! I’ve had this machine for about 6 months now, and had to come write a review of how much it’s improved my quality of life. If you love coffee and spend hundreds a month on lattes at cafes like I was, def look into this machine. It’s very professional, but isn’t hard to get the hang of, and soon you will be able to craft your perfect cup. I was a barista for years so the learning curve was short, but being that I was a barista, I can say this is as cafe grade as you can get at home. 10/10"
697,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love Starbucks and this coffee is just as good! We love it and would not hesitate to buy it again. Took me about two weeks to master the ""foam"" but now it is a wonderful cup of coffee every single day. Breville is easy to use - not quick though, got to let the water warm up - 20-30 minutes, then ensure it is clean at the end. Directions are easy to use and after I watched 2 weeks of repeated YouTube videos on how to get the milk to foam, I got it! Love, love, love this machine!"
698,5.0,2022-03-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Where do I start? I love this machine. We have had it for a month. It produces great espresso-based drinks. My wife and I have tried lates, americanos, cupacinos, etc. I tried to put in a lot of research on espresso machines, and as you know reading this they can go from $200 to $2000 easily. Obviously this is not a cheap machine, but I can assure you it is well worth the purchase. I believe we paid $599 for ours a month ago, but have already made well over $100 worth of ""starbucks"" on this thing. The value is there. The build quality is there. There are a ton of reviews on youtube to help you become a pretty damn good barista. You can not only impress yourself and significant other, but friends after cooking dinner? Family staying over? Looks great on the counter as well!

The difference between 'most' (read: Starbucks) beans and a proper espresso bean is quite remarkable. It will leave you thinking that 'their' coffee is completely bitter. I'm not a coffee snob yet, but I did do a little research online to find a good quality bean. We settled with LavAzza- which produces a great golden crema....completely smooth!

This will kick your morning coffee routine up a considerable notch!"
699,2.0,2019-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine less than a year ago and did not buy the protection plan. If you buy this, do buy the protection plan. It worked great and made great shots, however, it didn’t even last one year before the pump went out. This is very disappointing for such an expensive machine. I decalcified it regularly and kept it very clean. Did I get a lemon or is this just a bad machine? Based on the reviews here, it seems people love the machine. If it lasted more than a year, I’d give the output 5 stars.

Would not recommend."
700,5.0,2021-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love a good cup of coffee and this machine delivers!
It does take some practice when learning how to get the pressure just right, you need to adjust the dials on the side and inside of the grinder to get that perfect match.
Love this machine"
701,5.0,2021-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"my second Breville - the first one lasted for 7 years but the grinder finally started acting up so I went shopping for a replacement. I found a ""used"" one that said it was never used but was opened and had a cosmetic defect. The box had been opened but if had ZERO defects. I couldn't find a scratch or mark on the machine itself. This machine, just like my last one, probably makes four lattes a day every day. I was originally shopping just for a replacement grinder since my old machine still pumped out the espresso without a problem but the difference between a quality grinder and this one was negligible so I just got a whole new machine. I purchased some grinder cleaning tabs, hoping to get a solid 10 years out of this one! I'll let you know!"
702,5.0,2020-11-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this thing. It was a little daunting at first since it’s programmable and the cleaning instructions looked a little verbose.
The machine is a joy to use and the espresso shots come out perfect (a little on the strong side) with no adjustment aside from the grind size."
703,5.0,2021-07-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Using this product is my favorite part of the morning. It’s so easy to use after you get the hang of it. I did watch a couple of YouTube videos beforehand because I didn’t want to bother reading the manual if I’m being honest. The features are pretty straight forward: a knob for amount of grinds, a setting for one or two shots, a steam spout, etc. I even got my dad to learn how to work it, which is saying a lot because he still can’t work the remote we’ve had for two years. I recommend it for coffee lovers and coffee making beginners alike. I will say that you need to be monitoring the water level because it doesn’t indicate when it’s low for you. I suggest you buy a container for the coffee grinds nearby as well to make cleaning easier."
704,5.0,2018-04-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought mine here on Amazon in January of 2015. Since then, I've used it to pull thousands of shots of espresso, and it continues to perform flawlessly. I've always been impressed with the ability to get consistent shots and the frothing works great, as well.

The only repair I had was a $25 pump that failed last year. I replaced it myself (since this is such a popular model, parts and instructions are easy to come by). The attention to maintainability also comes through in the recommendations for descaling. Unlike other manufacturers, Breville doesn't push customers to buy expensive descaling powder. Instead, they recommend simple vinegar. Works fine and is a lot cheaper."
705,5.0,2022-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have had this machine for only a week, so I'll make sure to update accordingly, but initial expectations have been greatly exceeded.

The only experience I have had with at-home espresso was a cheapo >$50 machine 10+ years ago and a pod Nespresso machine. Both lacked the body and intensity you want from espresso... I had decided delicious espresso was something you had to purchase from a barista at a cafe.

I was wrong. I am so glad I bought this machine after contemplating it for awhile, wish I had done it sooner!"
706,5.0,2020-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Only had it a few weeks so can't speak to it's longevity. This makes amazing tasting espressos. It's a 7 to 8 minute process for me including frothed milk on top and cleaning afterwards. It's not a 1 minute thing, but the taste and quality of the coffee is amazing. I don't even want Starbucks after this thing.... Starbucks is NOT as good in my opinion, for the beans that I use. The only things I don't love is (1) it uses a lot of beans compared to what I'm used to for coffee (2) it makes a bunch of steam after use which means don't install under cabinets (3) uses a proprietary water filter although I use filtered water already (4) it's not super fast end to end process ... takes a few minutes (5) expensive and (6) really need to clean things up with every use.

But i think the juice is worth the squeeze in this case... or the more appropriately the coffee is worth the Breville! :-)"
707,5.0,2022-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is by far the best thing I bought in a long time.
708,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was very skeptical about this - I generally use a high end espresso maker at home and at the office, but I wanted something simple for our home in the country. It works incredibly well, though it's a bit flimsy in its build (it looks pretty substantial in photos). However, it's terrific to push the button and have the portafilter fill to exactly where you want it, put the tamper away in its magnetic holder, and press a button that dispenses the water really nicely, and the frothing want is flexible and a perfect length without all that plastic that a lot of machines have on their wands. Also, it's programmable so you can customize it to exactly what you want. It has a ridiculous number of little tools (most are unnecessary), but they all fit in a drawer that hides in the back, under the machine, and it comes out when you remove the drip tray because it links to the tray with a magnet. It's a very clever design. All in all, it's been a terrific machine (only had it for a few months) and does a terrific job on shots, crema, and frothing."
709,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A little bit of a learning curve with this. I had a small DeLonghi before this and it lasted 9 years! So I was hesitant about paying this much money and not having any experience with the Breville brand. I’ve only had it for a few days but I LOVE it. It did take a few tries to get my settings “just right” for how I like my espresso. But after that, every cup has been perfect. Easy to use milk steamer (which by the way was one of only 2 complaints with my old DeLonghi). Since I live way out in the country away from any Starbucks, this is well worth the price to me. Now I can have my espresso everyday"
710,5.0,2021-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Was very easy to use and gives a great brew every time!
711,4.0,2021-04-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use and great quality. Only reason why it’s 4 stars is simply because you cannot brew and steam at the same time. Other than that, it’s amazing!"
712,5.0,2020-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We went to a friends who had a very expensive espresso machine. We fell in love with the coffee but just couldn't spend the $$. We found this one and had it up and running quickly. Makes great coffee, it did take me a little longer to figure out how to steam the milk but after a little trial and error, who needs Starbucks anymore!!!"
713,5.0,2021-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What can I say, this machine is true art and a must have if you want great coffee - espresso - and the desire to become an expert at making them. It is a beautiful machine, in fact just to look at it is enjoyable as it adorns any kitchen clad in stainless steel - it just blends in so nicely. It is well made, the instructions are good, not great as they seemingly assume that due to your penchant to visit Starbucks, you know the subtle adjustments needed for a good espresso - Regardless, there is plenty of info out there on how to make one. As for this exact machine, there are several adjustments that you need to experiment with; coffee type, freshness, the corse of the grind, the amount into the ""portafilter,"" the pressure of the tamping of the coffee, the viscosity of the coffee into the shot glass, the stretching of the milk, and so forth. If you are used to a coffee pod, or Mr coffee handing you a cup on the way to work, this is not your machine. If, on the other hand, you both want to learn about and enjoy the end-result of making your own espresso, this is the one!"
714,2.0,2019-11-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When I plugged in the just received brand new Breville BEX870XL, it tripped the GFCI outlet on the kitchen countertop. It also tripped all other GFCI outlets around the house. After the frustration, I plugged it into the non-GFCI outlet and was able to power on the machine. However, I felt the plastic plate above the boiler was warm even when the power button was off. I suspected there was some wiring issue in the machine. Not much support I got from Breville, virtually non-exist, I decided to take the machine apart to find out the root cause. After taking the exterior plastic case out, I found the wiring inside the machine was poorly organized, and found a couple locations where the hot wires were crossing the ground wires although these wires were insulated, but certainly not adequate in my view. Because of this cross-over points, the current has small ""leak"" through the wire insulation into the ground wire but enough current flow to trip GFCI. After re-routing these wiring to avoid the cross-over points, the machine has been working properly without tripping GFCI problem. If you have similar issue like mine, you might want to check the wiring inside the machine. I hope Breville should fix their problem as this could be a fire hazard issue to the consumers."
715,2.0,2019-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Initially the machine seemed great - nice espresso, milk steaming was easy, etc.

By the end of week one we experience that the pressure was screwy. A few seconds into steaming the milk the steamer would just die. We'd turn the machine off, use the guide to troubleshoot and it might work again or it might not. Google indicated that the pressure hose is a known issue. Something was obviously wrong with the machine, so we thought no problem - we'd simple exchange it. Annoying but easy enough with Amazon, right?

Nope. Amazon refused. First, the website wouldn't allow the exchange to be processed on the website directly and diverted me to customer service. I ""chatted"" with three Amazon separate service techs. #1 asked me a series of questions, went silent and diverted me to #2. #2 asked me identical questions, went silent and then I ended up with tech #3. #3 asked me identical information and then refused to do an exchange and insisted that it was a warranty issue and I had to go through Breville's warranty department. For a two week old machine that we bought through Amazon. At that point I decided to forget about it and just return it. So #3 decided that to do this, I would need to talk to service person #4. At that point, I quit and processed the return on the website, which I apparently COULD do.

I know they wouldn't exchange the machine because it was purchased on sale and two weeks later it no longer was, but that's completely unacceptable.

If you decide to order this, order it through a company more reputable than Amazon."
716,5.0,2022-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I always go straight to negative reviews before buying. Seems like service or lack of service when needed is the only issue. ( we hadn't needed anything)
This espresso machine gave me goosebumps as it works so well @ 5% of some of the cheaper espresso machines I had to purchase commercially for my gelato businesses. I did experience maybe one in twelve single shots shorter than 1 ounce. But over all its nearly perfect . If I have a service and its less than stellar I will re- review accordingly. But @ 1yr and 8 mos old ...THIS FAMILY LOVES IT !!! If I get three good years out of It I will feel like I robbed Breville! My very expensive commercial machines needed constant ""expensive service""! LOVE THIS MACHINE!!! NO ISSUES SO FAR !:):)"
717,5.0,2013-11-16, Black Sesame,My La Pavoni of 20 years needed some work and I decided to try the Breville and I was not disappointed. It makes an excellent cappuccino and the steamer works fine once you get used to it not being turbo charged.
718,4.0,2022-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the best of the 500 dollar range units we looked at. It has a few quirks but they are easily resolved as you get to know the machine. Good automatic grinding and making of the espresso. Good steam production. I do recommend this unit.
719,5.0,2020-11-29, Black Sesame,"I bought it Amazon used , surprisingly no scratch on it, work like a champ
Better than Starbucks
It is pretty early to judge it but so far so good

Follow up review
Almost a year now and I can not express how satisfied I am
Life changing
I calculated how much money I saved from not buying a 5 $ latte every morning 5 days a week and it is about 1300$
Very good investment
And I keep changing coffee beans to explore different brands and kinds
Best so far is single source coffee beans Volcanica .
I hope I have money to buy this machine for every single coffee addict fella lol"

721,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is legit!
Coming from an ex Barista of 8 years, I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of shots this thing pulls. With a few adjustments when setting up, and pulling a few shots through to test what grind is good, I had great shots in a few minutes."
722,5.0,2022-02-20, Black Sesame,Awesome machine.
723,4.0,2019-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update: I finally made the adjustment on the top of the coffee bean basket to the grind and magic - my pressure is perfect! So glad I bought this, no regrets what so ever!
Ok, so I have been using this for a week. We were daily at our local coffee shop and they closed so we decided to purchase this. Let’s start with it is for sure a learning process. Watch the YouTube videos first - Seattlecoffee I think was there name had a couple good ones. I still can’t get the pressure perfect but it’s close and the drinks taste good! I am really happy with my purchase and the machines. The grinder is awesome and the steamer works perfect!"
724,5.0,2020-08-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First out the box: perfect condition, wonderfully packed so that it didn’t get smashed by ups. It has fast start instructions with pictures which I really appreciated. I love that it is compact. The gauges help you make a perfect cup of coffee. The instructions also show you what to do if the coffee is too strong, weak, gauge is low with pictures again! The steam wand is moveable and easily stores away tucked into the machine. It all looks scary on the picture but it is very simple to operate and I am a nurse and I’ve never been a barista or worked in a coffee shop.
Cons: well I shouldn’t say “cons” really, more like “oh well”..water tank is in the back of machine and our machine is placed with a kitchen cabinet above it so it’s hard to get to. So laziness plays a factor in that con I guess.
Long and short, it’s worth every penny! I also highly recommend this particular model with the grinder. like other reviews have said it makes the brewing process and grinds perfect."
725,5.0,2022-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best cup of coffee ever. It’s fun to work at mastering the art of brewing a great cup of coffee. I compare it to my pellet grill, which is a fun way to make fabulous food, If you put in the time to master it. It’s the same experience I have using the Breville Barista Express while trying to make a cup of coffee to be proud of. You can’t make great coffee without the right tools. And this machine is the right tool for the job. I smile a lot in the mornings now."
726,5.0,2021-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this thing. I did quite a bit of research, and it seems like there can be a bit of a no (wo)man's land in espresso machines. Some people say you're foolish for spending anything less than $400 on a grinder (yes, a grinder), and that anything under a grand for a grinder and espresso machine combo is just a waste of money. On the other hand, I have a good friend who has the older model of this machine, and he speaks really highly about it, so I was intrigued. I was lucky enough to get an Amazon gift card for xmas and decided to use it on this, as the downside was minimal in this case. I'm happy to report that it makes an absolutely killer espresso with a minimal amount of work (have to dial in your grind size and amount of coffee ground, as well as getting a feel for how much pressure you should be using to tamp the grounds before inserting the portafilter into the machine), but once you figure that out...you're in for a treat. Great crema, consistent results, well thought-out design, and just plain looks good. Highly recommended."

728,5.0,2022-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I Purchased this machine to help my wife from going to Starbucks everyday. Had to mess with the grind amount and the size to get that nice espresso brew pressure, but now I make her some of the best americanos, lattes, & mochas. As a former barista working on really expensive Italian model machines, Im impressed with the build of this breville. You can't sling more than 2 shots like an industrial one with 4-8 at a time . All in all So Far So Good. (my wife still goes to Starbucks though just not as often :)"
729,5.0,2019-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Highly recommend it! Works great and looks beautiful on the countertop
730,2.0,2021-05-11, Black Sesame,I’ve had the machine since august 2020 and the pressure gauge is already broken. For a $600 machine that is extremely disappointing. I had a deLonghi espresso machine that lasted 10 yeas that I replaced with the Breville thinking it would be a better machine. Guess I was mistaken.I contacted breville and they acted like they were doing me a favor by suggesting I send it to them and they’d work on it for $300 and give me a 6 month warranty. Of course I pay postage. Thanks but no thanks. I’d rather get a new different machine from a different company.
731,5.0,2016-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy setup with clear instructions. Best espresso we've ever had with consistant quality. Use of razor precision dose trimming tool ensures consistant quality. Easy to refill with water by opening the water tank lid without removing tank. Rotate steam/hot water dial to run for 5 secs to heat up the group head prior to extraction. Pressure gauge provides immediate and accurate feedback on tamping quality. Re-programming shot volume is a nice feature to ensure you add the right amount of water for the desired taste. Very good quality built in to this espresso machine.
732,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"the grinding mechanism seems to get bound up. that is, it doesn't grind a full amount. i have to put the end of my thermometer in the beans to get them to flow. sometimes even then it doesn't work. sometimes the expresso doesn't come through. i have to run it twice to get the correct amount of expresso. this is my second breville BES870XL. still worth it though."
733,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great espresso machine and we use it every day. It has definitely paid for itself over the last year that we've owned it since we're not going out and spending $5 a cup at some coffee shop.

We did have to send our machine back after about 8 months due to some odd issues BUT the fact that Breville was there to help diligently has got me telling everyone how amazing their service is! The only downfall from this was the couple of weeks that we had to spend without our Breville which actually caused us to realize just how much we love it!

Highly recommend this product for your espresso and Breville as a company!"
734,5.0,2020-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"And you are debating if it's worth the money. Debate no longer! Yes, it is pricey but it will elevate your coffee to a whole new level. No longer will you have to pay $10 to drink Starbucks like a peasant."
735,2.0,2019-10-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought the product back in Oct 2020. After 3 months of use, the dual wall basket no longer works. I googled other customers' reviews and it seems like a common issue where the holes are clogged. Some suggested cleaning with brush, poking the holes, burning it over the stove to release the ground that's stuck in the holes...I tried, nothing worked. I tried to call the support line, was waiting for over an hour and eventually had to hang up the call. I tried to submit the request online, the form requires the batch number which was supposed to be on the sticker on the bottom of the machine...that batch number doesn't exist. I added a random 4-digit number in there just so I could submit the form, I got an error saying it that the content exceeded the limit, unrelated to the number, completely a different issue. So looks like I'll probably end up having to buy the replacement myself and pay for shipping because I can't get help from Support. Luckily the part is not expensive, I can't imagine if it was something more complicated and expensive and I can't get help from the manufacturer for a unit that I paid over $600 for in just about 3 months ago. I like the product but may not consider buying anything from Breville in the future if they can't provide support when I need it."
736,5.0,2022-03-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my second Breville, I had the previous model of the Barista Express prior to this one. I am happy with the improvements Breville made with this, specifically the burr grinder which feeds much better, and the hot water dispenser addition. I am disappointed that to spite regular cleaning, filter replacement, etc, my previous Breville only lasted about 3 years. Perhaps I shouldn't be disappointed given that I used it nearly every single morning and made at least 4 double shots each time - that's a lot of espresso. This espresso machine is very easy to use and maintain, and produces such a great cup of espresso that after spending about a week looking at everything available within the $250 - $1,000 price range and reading reviews on numerous other products, I felt that this was still the right choice for me. (That was quite the week by the way, when I had to realize just how expensive the coffee drinks I make at home really are, and how much BETTER they taste from my Breville!) If this one lasts longer than the last one I will be absolutely thrilled because I love this espresso machine, the drinks it helps me make, and the money it saves me."
737,4.0,2022-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The coffee tastes wonderful. The machine is easy to use, powerful, and well-engineered. My only complaints are 1) that the machine requires frequent cleaning and descaling, and 2) the specialized descaler packets are never in stock at the manufacturers website. This is a problem that affects all Breville espresso machines since they require occasional descaling."
738,5.0,2019-07-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes espresso that's as good as any coffee shop. It takes a bit of time to figure out how to use it. Watching videos online was helpful, but even then, it can seem overwhelming.

After tweaking the settings for the grind size and the amount of coffee to grind, I can make a delicious cup.

You can't steam milk at the same time you're brewing, but that's OK."
739,5.0,2022-08-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s worth the price.
It makes decent espresso.
After a week or so, I found the right grind size that matches my taste.
After a couple of weeks, I found the right milk brand for latte art.
It’s a single boiler, however, you only need to wait for a few seconds before you can start frothing milk.
I got a funnel which makes things stay nice and tidy.
I also bought a distributor which makes a nice flat bed to avoid channeling.
Overall, I’m very happy with the purchase and I’ve owned the machine for a couple of months now."
740,5.0,2020-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love everything about this product. It took me awhile to figure out the right grind size but I think I was not using great espresso. I have a local coffee shop that roasts their own espresso so I am able to get it very freshly roasted and that makes a huge difference in the quality of espresso shot. Great Machine!
741,5.0,2021-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Gift to daughter & family. They love espressos, lattes, steamers and ease of operation."
742,4.0,2021-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you're buying this machine to make 16 oz latte drinks (mocha, hazelnut, etc.), be prepared to use FOUR containers every time you make your morning coffee. One for your finished drink, a smaller one for the pulled espresso itself (only a small cup will fit under the porto-filter), one for the milk (the little frothing pitcher included is too small for the amount of milk needed for a large drink), and one for the ""waste"" water - (which comes from heating up the porto-filter, and the initial turning on of the milk steamer). Once you have your setup down, it does make a great coffee. I've been a long-time Nespresso capsule user (owned a Citiz), and this does produce a better coffee. But it's a lot more work. I've only ""upgraded"" because I didn't want to deal with the aluminum issue in my food anymore. As for type of containers - I've found it easiest to have a bunch of cup and half-pint glass masons jars (the latter, for the milk) at the ready - cheapest and great to use glass and see inside to keep an eye on what may be going on."
743,2.0,2020-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,After one year the frothing stick or hot water feature no longer worked. Was good while it worked but expensive for only lasting one year.
744,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Preface: this review is coming from someone that has just been using a k-cup coffee machine, and is not a coffee connoisseur by any means.

This espresso machine is great! It's super easy to use, only takes a few minutes to make an espresso/latte/whatever you want. The automatic grinder that's integrated into the machine is a must-have feature. The water reservoir is big enough that you don't need to fill it every day (We are refilling every 3 or 4 days, with 2 people using the machine). the drinks made by this machine are way better than anything that I've ever made at home. I'm sure you can get higher quality drinks and grinds and everything with the more expensive machines ($1k+), but this machine is a good balance of price with drink quality. Would recommend. Would buy again."

746,5.0,2014-03-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this amazing machine a little less than a month now. I LOVE IT!

My latte art needs considerabke improvement...but these are a couple of my attempts so far. I'm writing this review for anyone who has ZERO latte art experience, like me, and is considering this espresso machine for both great shots of espresso AND the possibility of creating art. The milk wand on this machine supports proper milk texturing, so there are latte art possibilities in this one! :)

It is a bit addictive! (Both the art creating and the latte drinking!)"
747,3.0,2020-06-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When we first got it, it worked great. However after 6 months it stopped automatically shutting off when pulling a shot and I had to manually hit the 1 or 2 cup button to stop the shot or else it would just overflow forever. Then after a few more months it stopped producing pressure altogether and is now heading for the dump and will be replaced with a new machine from a different brand."
748,1.0,2021-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's like a teen romance, awkward in the beginning as you get used to how the machine works and what the exact needs are to flourish (a good cup of espresso). Then it get's into a good rhythm but still requiring a lot of maintenance and attention (very needy) but overall still working well. Then becomes distant and the same love and care no longer works and then the machine, after many attempts to revive, craps out. Relationship over. Purchased in June 2020 and rip in May 2022."
749,3.0,2020-07-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes good espresso. But the settings are NOT adjustable as indicated in the manual - or when told to me by a customer service representative. The single and double settings are preset. Supposedly you can 'program' the size of the single and double - but you can't. You can get it to make a little more, but it still cuts off on its own. Also the 'amount' of coffee ground has a setting. I was told by the representative that it is adjustable - so it would cut off on its own when you determine how much you want it to grind and set it accordingly. But it doesn't. I have learned just to time how long I am grinding coffee into the filter holder. When I called for help on it, the first representative confirmed that both features should be user programmable. But then I was put on hold when she said she would get a technician. I hung up after 30 minutes of being on hold. Like I said - good coffee - but not what is advertised or written in the manual."
750,5.0,2022-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is pricy for sure for me at least, but I kept going to Starbucks every other day so I finally decided to get it with all the covid situation not being able to go in as much to the coffee shop.
I was making my own lattes in no time at all, there are lots of videos specifically for this machine so very happy with it. I wasn't very picky about taste quality before so I'm not sure how it compares to an actual latte from a coffee shop with real baristas but it tastes great to me. Definitely recommend."
751,3.0,2018-03-04, Black Sesame,"This was a gift from my wife. We got it b/c friends have one that is so awesome. We got ours and it worked well for a week. We kept it clean and took care of it. The issue is that the steamer spit out 1/3 cup of water into every beverage (there is a 30 second period when the machine warms up that spits out water which was normal, this is after the wand was warmed up). Also, the double shot setting was only spitting out single shots and sometimes they only spit out a few spurts of espresso. IT'S IMPORTANT to note that shots are only as good as the pressure, temperature, grind size and tamper. I'm a seasoned barista so this was working perfectly until it wasn't .

We didn't realize how bad our machine was until Breville sent us our warranty replacement machine. It's the same exact machine but operates 100% differently. The dials click when they are in the right position, mine didn't do that. The shots are producing at full volume. It's like the machine they sent us was made in a different factory.

The new machine is a 5/5. I give them a 3/5 b/c we spent a ton of money on a huge purchase. The experience we had was well below the $500 value."
752,5.0,2021-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes great expressos and Americanos. Our daughter and son-in-law have one, so we bought this and haven't been disappointed. There is a learning curve, but it is worth the time. We like strong coffee, and the automatic expresso makers were not adjustable enough to suit our tastes. It is made well, and cleans easily."
753,5.0,2016-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've had it now for almost 2 years and It has changed my coffee drinking experience! It makes an amazing cup of coffee. I don't even want to buy a cup of coffee any more because it's never as good as my Breville. It does take a bit of effort to dial in to which ever beans your using and it is a little loud and messy. So if you don't love and appreciate the art of making and drinking a fantastic cup of coffee you would be better off sticking with k-cups.
754,5.0,2021-11-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really good espresso machine.
You may consider this as feature or flaw but it takes a while to experiment with particular coffee sort to find settings for good coffee. Not all coffee tastes well.
But if you managed to, you’ll receive a cup of something really tasty. Forget about Starbucks. This espresso machine can produce a better coffee.

Guide doesn’t suggest so but I found that cleaning the portafiler more often with tablets makes difference. I’m cleaning it weekly or when I fill it tastes weird.

There is something annoying about it:
The used coffee often remains on the surface or machine when you remove the portafilter. Or the inner cup of portafiler remains there. In both cases you can remove it by placing portafilter back and twist a bit and if it doesn’t work you can remove it with your hands. beware it can be quite hot.

I wanted to give it 4 stars but given the discounted Amazon price of 460 I think this is minor flaw comparing to overall performance of that great product."
755,5.0,2019-05-29, Black Sesame,We just replaced our first one after 10 or more years and thousand if not 10’s of thousands cups of coffee. Love it
756,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It makes great coffee , looks great, and is easy to maintain. But this is my second machine in 45 days. The first one just stopped working. The replacement works well, but it’s glitchy. The gauge isn’t consistent, and I’m an experienced barista. The grinder is also glitchy. Overall I like the item, but concerned how long this one will last. Too pricey to have this much trouble."
757,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Purchased has a wedding anniversary gift for my Italian son in law. He loves it and he said it makes the best expresso and cappuccino he has ever tasted. It is so much better than Starbucks.
758,5.0,2021-06-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Oh, this espresso machine is my beloved.I use it everyday. I have been using it already two months, by far I don’t have any problems occurred. I wanted to say this is my best and most expensive purchased in 2020. I am not sure how long it will last, but at least I enjoy using it every single day. If you are a coffee lover likes I am, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY IT. Buying coffee in cafe shop is pretty expensive, you should invest the money on this espresso machine. Make your own coffee. Save money."
759,5.0,2021-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it ! Very well designed and easy to clean up!
760,1.0,2020-10-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have not been able to get a nice crema on my espresso! Tired of adjusting the grind size and amount, etc. It shouldn't be this complicated. I hate the pumping sound. The pressure gauge btoke after the second use. I would return it but it has been a year already. A friend looked at it and he couldn't fix it either.

A total waste of $700. Very disappointing It seemed like it would be a great machine. It's possible I got one that was defective. I tried again today to make a latte........coffee was gross and thin no crema. Hard time making the milk as well. You look at the videos and they make it look so easy.....Not. I would welcome any suggestions, or it's on its way to the trash.

The coffee grinder is basically the Only thing that works but who needs a $700 coffee grinder?"
761,5.0,2021-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"You will need to try a few different beans and adjustmemt with the settings to get it right, but once you do you will get a great cup of espresso."
762,5.0,2018-11-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I own a coffee shop in miami and this coffee machine it is like comercial machine; It is amazin, i already used for 1 month and highly recomend to buy."
763,5.0,2021-05-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine. As it happens the default grinder settings worked perfectly for a well-expressed coffee using our favorite beans. Did not even have to play with it and waste coffee. We replaced our dying Jura super automatic and now wish we had made the switch long ago. Cannot compare this crema and slow extraction to what you get in a fully automated machine. And the milk, though quite nice on the Jura, is not a true microfoam - this machine does microfoam quite easily - no huge learning curve for us. Best home capps and lattes we have ever had - and better than most cafes too. Worth every penny. Highly recommend. Videos online were helpful to watch before first use then it's a snap. Looks sharp but works like a charm every morning. Also coffee and milk are way hotter than on the superautomatic - on old machine our coffee was cold after a few seconds. This holds a nice heat for some time. What we get each morning rivals what we've enjoyed in Italy on vacation at every coffee stop. Yay!"
764,4.0,2021-10-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this machine to replace a Francis Francis that had burned out and have used it for about a month now. What we like about it: It's easy to use (must read instructions, though), it makes good expresso with lots of creama, is easy to clean up and any programming required is on such a basic level that anyone can figure it out. We haven't tried to coffee grinder yet because we have a separate grinder we use just for coffee. What we don't like about it: The expresso doesn't come out quite as strong as that made by the Francis Francis. Also the steamer doesn't make quite as good foam and it's trickier to use. I have to tilt the milk pitcher at just the right angle to get foam.
Overall we are satisfied with this machine and would recommend it to someone who wants to make good quality expresso at home. I should add that the expresso maker arrived quickly in good condition."
765,5.0,2019-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent design and high quality manufacturing. Have had this machine for 6 months and have zero significant complaints. It is ez to clean and maintain. A minor complaint is although key components are metal some, like the coffee and water reservoirs, are plastic (high quality) and could fail if not carefully handled - but this is a nit of little consequence.

There are a number of excellent Youtube videos to help you become a Barista expert, teaching you how espresso bean age affects shot quality and how to use the grind adjust to pull consistent shots that yield 15-20 sec shots. Turns out as beans age you need to make the grind finer. Using SB Espresso I find 3 gives good shots when pkg just opened but as coffee gets to be 1 week or more since opened, I move to 2 then 1. I had no idea age/humidity affected shot quality to such a degree.

In any case, for the price I'd venture one would be hard pressed to find a better machine. I give it my highest recommendation w 5*"
766,2.0,2021-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’m so disappointed. I’ve owned this machine for a little over a month and I’m constantly having to change the internal and external grind settings to ensure the pressure is good and for the beans to grind. I’ve been having to do this a couple of times a week when this should be a once every few months job. Such a hassle!! I looked into other reviews and people are complaining of the same thing. I just wish I caught this sooner but definitely not worth $600 for this constant mechanical work. I sadly will be returning.
767,5.0,2021-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased the Breville Barista Express from this vendor. I received one that was clearly used, covered in ground espresso and nasty from someone not cleaning coffee stains or the ports filter. I did reach out to the “customer service” team here and they simply said it wasn’t their problem and did not assist at all. I retuned the item with a little help from amazon (not the vendor) and went to purchase it at Best Buy. The one I know have is absolutely amazing! It will be something getting used to, always make sure to calibrate your machine first. Before buying I would suggest watching the how to and information videos done by Seattle’s Coffee gear. They will show you just about everything you need to know!"
768,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"I’m in love with this barista brewer!! It takes a bit practice to get used to it, but it’s easy to use and super efficient! I simply buy the coffee beans from my favorite coffee store and I brew it at home. No more waiting in line or pre-ordering my coffee to go. I simply make it at home in my own kitchen and saves me over 20 minutes now on my daily routine & commute! It’s definitely worth the investment in this barista machine! Thinking of all the time and money spent on coffee outside! If you’re thinking whether to buy this machine or not, you should buy it now! You are going to love it!"
769,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville 870BSXL is a step above the rest. I have always been a quad shot espresso guy. I have had to scale it down to only two shots with this machine because of the level of flavor and frankly, the caffeine levels, this Breville can extract!!!

Crema? Oh glorious crema! Sweet, orange, thick and rich! Speaking of rich, the Breville makes a latte foam that is suitable for a bed pillow. The micro foam it creates is silky smooth. The built in burr grinder makes fresh ground coffee convenient, easy, and consistent.

It took a while to ""dial in"" the settings to get this machine to make the perfect espresso pull. That is because grind level, coffee amount, and tamping pressure create variables. However, the pressure gauge lets you know if you need more or less tamping or a finer coffee coffee grind. Breville suggests starting with s grind setting of 5. In my experience a setting of 3 is the perfect grind fineness.

The build quality and human interface engineering is excellent. It's heavy and feels high quality.

Enjoy the best mocha you will ever have."
770,5.0,2021-09-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love, love, love this machine!! My only complaint is that the steam want takes a long time to heat up milk. You need to know a little bit about espresso in order to make using this machine easy at first. As a former barista, it took me about 10 minutes to get everything set up and figured out. If you've never used an espresso machine, take your time and read the instructions carefully!! It looks to me like most the bad reviews are people who have never used an espresso machine and just tried to jump in. There is definitely a learning curve to get to that perfect espresso shot. The quality of your espresso beans (note, espresso roast is different from regular coffee roast) and the quality of water you use also has a lot to do with whether you'll enjoy your espresso. And for the love of God and all that is holy, clean your machine regularly! If you do all that, you'll definitely get good espresso out of your machine!!"
771,5.0,2020-10-26, Black Sesame,"I will now and forever be a coffee snob. It took us awhile to learn how to work this, even though we had used one while at a relative's house. However, learning has been half the fun. We have this down to an art form and love using this. We can make the best cup of coffee, latte, americano now, so much that when I go out to a coffee shop I compare them to what we can make at home. If you enjoy coffee this is a great investment."

774,5.0,2022-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to clean, east to fill, makes amazing espresso, especially using the double walled inserts it comes with, you can also use the single walled inserts but that's where you become a barista tweaking grind, tweaking how long the water takes over the grind and ""the pull"", all of which you don't need to know if you stick with double walled inserts. I am not close to be bored with the product that I want to tweak it yet, I can always look forward to nerding out on the single walled later."
775,4.0,2021-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great basic all in one manual espresso machine.

Downsides:
I don’t like that the portafilter actually has a plastic insert at the bottom under the metal filter. Wish that plastic part was also metal.

Takes some time to switch between making espresso and steaming. I wish the steam function had a “hold” position where the boiler could be held at steam temp to allow you to steam another milk right away. Now you need to turn it off (which purges the steam) to stop steaming milk and then turn back on again which forces the boiler to heat back up."
776,5.0,2021-06-13, Black Sesame,"This product is one of the best investments a coffee lover could make. If you appreciate a good fresh espresso (many more options) this machine is for you.

It does require a little more involvement than just pushing a button but it is very fun and it gives you full control of how you get your coffee.

We've been using it for about 2 months and are in love with it.

We make espresso, single and double, latte macchiato, cappuccino, espresso Americano and even the best ""Carajillo"".

Needless to say we recommend it.

Also the seller was a great experience and their customer service was outstanding."
777,5.0,2021-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nothing better than having great espresso. It took 2 weeks to find the right grind and amount of coffee needed for an amazing latte.
778,5.0,2019-08-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this espresso machine. We have been using it daily since we got it…8 months ago. It’s easy to use. Takes a little tweaking but once you hit the sweet spot the espresso, cappuccinos, and lattes are delicious!! I hope this machine never breaks."
779,5.0,2020-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been using this machine several times a day for several years now. It makes better coffee then any of the various coffee shops in the area despite the fact that they are using commercial machines. You can perfectly adjust the grind/dose, the coffee it brews is delightful.

The only complaint I have is the water catch tray is a bit annoying in its design but I'm not sure how it could really be designed better and after several years the cleaning light burned out on mine. It doesn't effect the coffee, just means I don't get automatic reminders on my phone."
780,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I will update my review as time goes by. My initial impressions. The pulls are fairly consistent, the temp is always perfect, and the reccomended blend is perfectly fine. After some tweaks I was able to get perfectly pressured pulls with minimal pockets. Overall I am very impressed. For an in home espresso machine this machine goes above and beyond. My only complaint is that the stainless steel is hard to keep clean but thats about it."
781,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have only had this unit for 3 weeks but I'm impressed with it so far. We had 2 DeLonghi units before and although they were not in the same class as this unit the Breville has several features that make it a much better experience than what our old one had to offer.

The built in grinder works very well and can grind from coarse french press to extremely fine for high crema espresso. The steamer arm swings very nicely and does not leak like many other models. The pressure gauge is very helpful in learning to adjust your tamping pressure for different types of beans and grinds. I like the built-in magnetic tamper so that you never loose it!

The knob that adjusts the grind amount does not seem to have a wide range and the grind can spill out easily. I just don't use the feature that grinds the correct amount and instead just press the basket forward under the grinder to start and stop the grinder and pack the grind once just over 1/2 way full then again when it is full to cut down on cleaning."
782,4.0,2021-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We liked the fact that when we called Breville for help we were connected instantly to a live person who talked us through the problem we were having.
We have been using this for about a month and love it. I think if I had a suggestion - it would be a reminder light about low water. The tank is in the back and it is hard to see and therefore hard to remember to check. Otherwise - it just takes time to get familiar with the grind and realize when we change to different coffee beans, we may need to also adjust the grind."
783,3.0,2022-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine and taste but steam knob is EXTREMELY HARD to turn!!!
784,5.0,2021-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We had the previous generation model for nearly 10yrs. The new model has several design improvements over the last that I really like.
1. The coffee bean hopper has a conical chute so I don't have to bang on it like the old model to get the coffee to feed through.
2. The brew cycle sounds different that the last model. I think they have changed how they meter the correct amount of water and pre-heat. I think this is an improvement b/c the old one failed to meter the correct amount (which is why we replaced it).
3. The drip tray and the liquid float is a better design and more accurate. If you don't know this, residual pressure/water/steam drains into the drip tray after every brew. There is a float mechanism that tell you to empty it. This new design is better!

Overall, this is a better product than the last model. This is a high quality machine. If you are in the market, I highly recommend this product!"
785,5.0,2019-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, no more Starbucks!"
786,5.0,2015-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm a month into this machine and I love everything about it; however I wish the espresso would brew a little hotter (no way to adjust temp), so I usually just add a bit of hot steamed water to it. It took me a little bit to figure it out properly with the pressure, but I am definitely getting my money's worth from it! Great timing with being home-bound due to COVID-19. It doesn't take that long to brew either, so whether I'm rushed or have time, I find myself using it a daily. Now I just need to figure out the latte art...if only it were that easy. Lol"
787,5.0,2021-12-30, Black Sesame,"I was familiar with the model after visiting a friend a few years back. I also have owned a DeLonghi in the past.
But doing the math for my ongoing capsule ordering for my Nespresso in the past 10 years and recycling issues with used pods, I decided it was time to switch. It is an investment for sure, but with the ease of use and the bean grinder built in, it's been great. I'll leave the discussion of the creme, etc to shots of espresso drinkers since I prefer a latte. The milk steamer is wonderful and simple to use and clean. I grind the coffee while the steaming wand is working on the milk (YouTube videos are helpful here) then draw the shot and top with milk and foam. (My latte art still needs work.)
PS. .. my plants love the used grinds."
788,5.0,2020-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve been a barista for 8 years and I can tell you this espresso machine goes hand in hand with the industrial ones from my job. I compared machines for weeks and settled on this one! If you want an even easier clean up you can just lay a few paper towels down to catch the grinds but you don’t need to. I have nothing negative to say about this product!
789,5.0,2021-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I LOVE my Breville. I am a career barista. I have had this machine for almost a year now and waited to write a review until now so I wasn't blinded by the initial excitement of purchasing a home espresso machine. I love to buy more expensive coffee from 3rd wave roasters and this machine is so easy to dial in I come away with professional shots almost every time. While this may be due to my experience in the shop, I will say that my husband is not a barista and picked up dialing in pretty fast using the breville guides included. My only complaint is that the steaming wand is not the best. It takes a couple tries starting it up to get it going full blast some mornings, but I have always been able to achieve latte art. That is a very small complaint considering this machine is half the price of its competitors but still can create some awesome coffee. I'd highly recommend it for baristas on a budget."
790,4.0,2021-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The instructions could have had a little more detail and I continue to have problems getting the pressure high enough. I have fresh coffee beans from a local roaster, the grind settings are on ""fine,"" think I have the knack of tapping the ground coffee. . .but my results are not consistent. However, when it does work the coffee is really good and I have no effects from the fully caffeinated beans. I was tempted to return it but decided to persevere."
791,5.0,2016-09-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this machine in Dec of 2017,and have used it every day since then, mostly for americano, and some lattes. We've ran well over 5000 shots through it, and it still works good, although at times now we have some problems with the steamer not wanting to steam, which is understandable for how much we've used it. I think our next machine will have dual boilers, which may solve that problem. Overall, I would recommend this machine!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ It's been well used and well loved!"
792,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This has become our most used kitchen appliance! Makes trips to the coffee shop obsolete. After using for the past few weeks I don’t know how we ever got through life without this little gem. From almost instant hot water (around 30ish seconds for the machine to rev up) for the perfect cup of tea to fresh ground coffee beans to the perfect latte, we have used the Barista express for several beverages a day and it has been a dream. If you’re on the fence about what espresso machine to buy, I couldn’t recommend the Breville more!"
793,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this this machine for five months. It started out working great. Now it doesn’t grind the beans and also does not express the coffee. I got the extended warranty (spoiler alert USELESS) the seller, Breville and the warranty company all refuse to help. The seller says it would have taken it back within three months of purchase, the extended warranty says it doesn’t kick in for a year. Breville won’t answer the phone and when they do they don’t believe what to tell them about the machine... very frustrating... you would think an $800 machine would last longer than five months..."
794,5.0,2014-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing machine worth it for the money. We use ours pretty much daily! We love it. Very easy to clean as well.
795,5.0,2022-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It is simple to use, the instructions were straightforward. I like that they have the ability to have holders for both ground and unground coffee, so I can make espresso from non caffeinated. Looking forward to using it more"
796,5.0,2021-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was so against getting an expresso machine. It seemed like so much effort, so much cleaning just for a small cup of Joe. But wow. This machine couldn’t be easier. From simple as pie controls to grinding just the right amount to excellent steaming, it does it all. It still requires more cleaning than a pod or simple drip maker, but it’s worth it. Also, it looks great on the counter. Highly recommend."
797,5.0,2022-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes really good expresso, is fun to use and feels well made and looks cool. We have had this machine for about a year and there have been no problems. I always worry about an all-in-one type unit because sometimes too many features are packed in. And there are more things to go wrong. However everything in this machines is still working well. So thats a good indicator of quality. But it is not 5 years either and I have not had to check out their service. Anyway it works really well."
798,5.0,2021-12-18, Black Sesame,"I love this thing.
I looked for 2 months at espresso machines and was just not sure on where to go. After watching tons of videos, reading reviews, and asking around and finally decided on this one. I was a little hesitant to spend the money (this is a bit much for me, I had to save up) BUT it is completely worth it. I was a little intimidated at first, but after reading over the manual it was very easy to get the hang of.
The grinder is amazing and its very easy to change your grind amount and settings.
After a few tries I was getting very consistent and delicious espresso. I have had no issues with the wand attachment either. Brevilles website has a lot of drink ideas if you are new to making different kinds of coffees like I am and have been very helpful.
The hot water dispenser is also very cool. I use it to heat up my mugs or to make an americano. I save a ton of money on coffee now."
799,5.0,2020-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Why did I waste the last 9 years on artless, cumbersome Jura-Capresso superautomatics when I could have had this machine? At a fraction the price of other high end machines, the barista express is exactly what I needed. For my tastes, a true superautomatic takes too much of the control out of your hands. This machine strikes the right balance of giving you control of your grind, dosing and froth without requiring too much manual labor. Perhaps most importantly, the brew quality is outstanding. The shots have a natural sweetness, and I haven't had crema this rich in years.My wife loves the artful design, as it replaces the ugly black plastic boxes (JC E8) on our kitchen counter. I believe the cleanup is actually much easier than my old superautomatics. My only small complaint is the water reservoir. Located on the back, it's difficult to access, especially when up against a wall or backsplash in your kitchen. And, there is no low water indicator, so there's a lot of moving this machine about to check water levels."
800,3.0,2022-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love the machine. Two months after warranty, pump goes out. They no longer sell that replacement part. However they still sell the same machine on Amazon. 600.00 is a lot of money to spend on something that can't be fixed."
801,5.0,2022-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The espresso machine is amazing, but I am here to talk about the amazing customer service. We had been using the machine for almost a year with no issues until one day my entire counter was coated in a pool of water. I had a hunch it was the water tank, so I took it out, flipped it over and boom, massive crack on the bottom. I figured it was probably from my daughter using the machine and forgetting to add water or adding cold water once it was already heated, I figured I'd call customer service to see what they could do. It was still under the warranty and after an 8 minute conversation I was able to get on with my day knowing a free re-placement was on it's way. I was elated with the fast and simple communication.

I've been on the fence with buying a new mixer and am definitely thinking about getting their mixer once I have the funds. Amazing company!!!!!"
802,5.0,2021-10-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this machine for several weeks and I'm sitting here drinking an iced latte thinking how much I love this thing! Seems pricey at first, but if you have a regular Starbucks routine, you're going to make that money back in 2-3 months and then it's gravy after that. The shots are excellent with a fantastic flavor and never dissappoint."
803,5.0,2022-01-09, Black Sesame,Home run for people who want a coffee/latte whenever it sounds good! Very User friendly!
804,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it!
805,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,I love this espresso machine. It's already starting to save me money by not going on coffee runs all the time!
806,5.0,2019-07-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far, it is a great machine.

If you hate reading manual (recommend) YouTube to the rescue. Watch it before operating it.
Many tricks to adjust and pre-program it."
807,5.0,2018-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Fácil de usar , excelente textura y sabor de café"
808,3.0,2016-09-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've only had this a bit over a month but so far we really like it. Good looking machine, great compact size, decent pressure for foaming milk, overall works very well and our cappuccinos are coming out better all the time. There are lot's of adjustments that can be made so it can take a few tries to work out grind, tamping pressure, water volume for shots etc, just what I was hoping for. If the rating was for the machine alone I would give it 4+ stars for sure.
The downside is that as soon as I opened the box, there's was big notice ""This product contains substances that are suspected of causing cancer"". That's a paraphrase but it's essentially what it said. I called Breville and they weren't ready, willing or able to tell me exactly what those substances were or where in the machine they were, but assured me that all the parts that come into contact with anything that's consumed is tested to be safe. Apparently this is a California code thing and I assume (since Breville was absolutely useless and not helpful at all) it's probably some grease or lubricant that's used deep in the machine and is toxic if you eat a pound of it. I think it's quite lame that Breville is not more forthcoming about it and consider it a major weakness for the brand. I can't figure out what they're hiding or why but 1 star for customer service in this area. Really a shame. Also, I've read from other posts on line that the grinder can break down pretty quickly so we sprang for the 3 year service plan. I know those are generally a rip off but figured I'd cover myself on this one."
809,5.0,2022-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have one at home after we installed one at work and used it without any issues for 18 months. 18 months of pulling no less than 100 shots per day, every single day, and I bet many more than that at times. Our home unit is perfect. It just barely fits under the cupboard, which is exactly 16 1/8"" from counter to bottom edge of the cupboard, so measure that first. Another 1/8"" taller and it would not fit with the lid (necessary) to the bean container installed.

We've had no issues so far, and the coffee is amazing. The grind is consistent and once setup, we just use the same beans and same settings. The milk froth is solid, not Starbucks powerful, but pretty quick. It's easy to clean, and simple top operate. I can't imagine a better wedding gift from a group wanting to avoid the typical gifts."
810,5.0,2021-09-24, Black Sesame,"I bought this for $250 less than the normal price on an Amazon warehouse deal.
It's brand new (never used), but they said ""used"" and it came with Amazon outer box (without original box).
It was perfectly working good and I love this Breville Barista Express.
The taste fantastic with Starbucks Pike Place and Lavazza Italian Espresso mixed bean.
I make coffee 3 times day with this machine. Now I can't live without this Breville."
811,5.0,2022-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For the money spent, the Breville makes a really good espresso. The frother takes a little longer but makes my Latte and Cappuccino taste like hot ice cream. I've only had a couple of months and am still learning to use it to get the right pressure. Takes a while to set that straight and so much goes into it depending on the beans you use. Youtube will become your friend. After using fresh beans, you will not use ground up beans."
812,5.0,2021-09-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After spending thousands of dollars at a local coffee shop we decided to make an investment that would ultimately pay for itself in the long run. We still buy the beans from our local shop, but now I prefer my latte over theirs! Not sure how I lived without this. The only thing I regret is not buying it sooner. You will absolutely love this machine and become and instant coffee snob that only likes their own homemade coffee!"
813,5.0,2021-12-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Loved this product. How ever it a little to big for my counter
814,5.0,2017-02-04, Black Sesame,I have had my Breville for about a month and a half and I Finally have perfected my morning cup of coffee. I will be honest and tell you that I threw away about 1lb of beans and plenty of cream. I couldn't get the taste exactly how I wanted so it is a lot of practicing. I love waking up in the morning and making the perfect Americano that gets me through my day! Worth every penny. Sorry Starbucks!
815,5.0,2017-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had several different types of espresso machines in the past. By far this is the best that I have owned.

It literally took me 2 attempts to get the precise grind and right application of pressure on the coffee grounds to make an amazing cup of espresso.

It will take less than 6 months for this machine to pay for itself saving us from trips to places like Starbucks to pick up our espresso drinks.

There are tons of videos on the internet of people using this particular machine which anyone buying this should take a few moments to go and watch so that way you can make an amazing cup of espresso every time.

Buying any other type of machine is a waste of money. It might cost a little more than some but the quality it's worth the price."
816,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After waiting more than two weeks my machine arrived(delay caused by Covid-19) and few minutes later I was making espresso and frothing milk , easy to use if you have read about it.
few adjustment needed here and there specially for the grinder. once you get the hang of it you will enjoy it,
this model has only one boiler so you are ether extracting or frothing milk can't do both at the same time.
good for beginners, but totally need some work for better results."
817,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a great cup of coffee and cappuccino
818,5.0,2020-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had this machine for a year now, time to review it. This machine works and performs perfect! Never had any issues but once, tip don't overfill the coffee grinder or else it will jam. That was the only issue on my part! No rust or broken pieces after a year of heavy usage. I made about 12 cups a day and have used the steamer for 12 times a day also. No clogging or issues with the quality of the product. You do need to clean this machine about 1-2 monthly based on 12 cups a day so remember to order the cleaning tablets cause the ones you get free in this box will be gone in 6 weeks. The stuff this machine makes tastes so good and it's better than spending your money at Starbucks. I have used whole and ground beans and both styles come out perfect! Cleaning is easy, takes less than 10 minutes to cycle and break down the machine."
819,3.0,2019-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had two Gaggia Syncrony Logic RS before I bought this machine. The Gaggia made a wonderful espresso every time, and without much effort. Unfortunately, the compacting part stopped working on both machines after a few years, so I decided to switch to a different brand.

It takes more effort to make espresso with the Breville since it's semi-automatic. The instruction manual is very clear, and it took very little time to get familiar with the machine. The disappointment comes from the quality of the espresso. The Gaggia gave me a thick layer of crema, but there is hardly any crema with this machine, even though I use the same blend of coffee I have been using for years (I make my own blend), and I have set up this machine exactly the same way I set up my Gaggia."
820,5.0,2021-10-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Feb 28 2021 update
Still works beautifully 3 years later. I keep a dispenser of paper towels next to it for cleanup (dampened). Just remember to keep it simple at first, then work your way up to the fancy coffee drinks. I keep my batista at an angle on counter below a cupboard for extra counter space. It works for me.

Once you've mastered operation of barista you'll enjoy your special coffee drinks every day.

It's always best to read the manual carefully. If you still have trouble getting the results you want (like I did) call Breville for support. They walked me thru step-by-step with perfect results! Couldn't have done it without their support.

I follow these very basic steps every time after making espresso:

1. Top water reservoir back to the maximum fiill line

2. Keep steamer clean after each use

3. Wipe machine down with a damp cloth

Not much bother at all to get a great espresso every time!"
821,3.0,2018-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Nice machine, but the amount of coffee being wasted is substantial, and the usability is not very good.
A lot of coffee ground misses the portafilter and is wasted in the tray.

The lights are so bright you can’t read the labels. There are 1 and 2 cup button for water, but not for the grind.
Therefore at least 1 light for 1 cup and 2 lights for 2 cups would be a good start.

Would be nice to have a green light, once the water is hot enough, so you don’t get cold espresso.

Would be also nice to have a red light if there is not enough water in the tank.
Would be also nice if there is a red light if there not enough coffee in the hopper.

If you don’t check manually, the machine runs without (enough) water and/or without (enough) coffee and that requires a restart after filling up.
This is standard even on the now Phillips-Saeco machines. I really miss the old real Saeco ones.

Otherwise it’s working well."
822,5.0,2018-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife has wanted one of these for a couple years. After reading reviews of several brands we selected this model. It makes wonderful espresso and cappuccinos. It took some experimentation to set up, but we followed the directions and troubleshooting guides and within about 1.5 hours had excellent and consistent brews.

We used SB espresso beans, and had to set the grind much coarser (10) than the recommended starting point (5). Then slight increase in grind amount. And increased the brew time (increased brew amount) about 50% using a stopwatch. Water temp up a little. And finally perfected our tamping technique to avoid over-pressure, which is easy to monitor from the front panel. Our very first cup was paint-thinner quality, but with a little patience and re-programming it is approaching perfection with an excellent and thick creme. While all the adjusting sounds complex, it really wasn't, and I like the fact that we can tailor it to our beans and taste buds. I would not buy a unit without adjustability in the future, and pleased that we bought this one.

As a bonus it stores the tamper in a convenient spot in the front with a magnet, and the other odd's and end's in the tray drawer below."
823,1.0,2017-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Updated review a couple months after the warranty expired;

Original review:

I am really happy with this espresso machine. I love grinding the beans ""on demand"" right when going to pull the coffee. I guess that gives the freshest flavor.

I have used home machines before. Always it was really difficult getting the coarseness of the grind and the packing of the head just right so that the pressure was correct to properly extract the espresso flavor from the grounds. The pressure gauge on this unit has totally taken the guesswork out of the process. I love it. I have been able to dial the coarseness of the grind and the strength of my tamping to get the pressure gauge to sit right in the middle of the desired range. This is giving me very nice crema on the espresso and a very reasonable extraction speed. I really like it.

I also like having the integrated grinder so it's super easy to tweak the coarseness of the grind up or down just a tad.

For steaming milk, the machine is not quite a perfect. When the machine just heats up, first a bunch of liquid water comes out, then it takes a minute for the steam to start. It would be nice if this was faster. HOWEVER, this is just a home unit at a very reasonable price: not a $3,000 commercial unit. So I think a little delay getting steam is fully understandable.

Cleaning is reasonably easy. Though there probably could be a more graceful way of handling overpressure water rather than dripping it down below the tools tray. Why not drip it into the catch basin itself? Not a big deal. Easy.

The one feature I would ask for would be a 1/4"" water connection so that households with plumbed filtered water can skip the water reservoir and just plumb directly to a filtered water line. But again this is just a $600 home unit rather than a multi-thousand dollar commercial unit so it's understandable this feature is missing. (But it sure would be nice.)

We texture both regular lowfat milk for me and almond milk for my wife. Works well with both though strangely not all milks are created equal. Horizon organic milk textures particularly well.

Update:
I have now owned the machine 18 months. It's been out of warranty 6 months. And now it rolls over and die. No pressure. No coffee. No cleaning cycles. I am wondering if I have a $700 piece of garbage or if it'll be fixable, and how I'll get it to them to fix, and how much it'll freakin' cost me. Very very very unhappy."
824,5.0,2020-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After repairing our old Senseo several times, it finally broke in a way that wasn't repairable. The time had come to expand our coffee horizons! We enjoyed the coffee produced by the Senseo, but it was limited to using pods or a pod-replacement filter. The new machine would have to be flexible and the Barista Express delivers! You can make any type of coffee beverage you desire using whole beans or pre-ground coffee. The machine gives you control over nearly every variable in making coffee beverages. The recommended settings in the quick start guide worked well and the instructions for adjusting them based on results were helpful. I'm now making lattes with confidence although my latte art is not quite there, yet! I've used whole beans and pre-ground with good results. We prefer the whole beans for better flavor and crema. Our only regret now is that the Senseo lasted so long. We're making much better coffee with the Barista Express!"
825,5.0,2018-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am a surgical instrument engineer and appreciate well thought out, precision products. This machine is very well built with a lot of thought about the process of making an expresso. We use it for Americanos and Lattes with excellent, fun results. The grinder is superb and very sensitive to different grinding needs. The thoughtful Expresso tamper is cleverly attached by a magnet. The variations of adjustment combinations should provide a long, rewarding experience for finding the perfect cup, cannot wait to do further experiments.

The machine is made of quality components and very nice fitting attachments. The tool bin is hidden away in the bottom section yet easily retrieved. There has been obvious lengthy testing of the entire machine before it was released to the consumer.

The only item that I thought could have been added is a better funnel for the coffee to feed into the portafilter, although some spillage makes it feel more authentic to a coffee shop. Love our machine."
826,5.0,2021-10-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Based on negative reviews here, the biggest issue plaguing Breville isn’t with initial quality but rather with reliability issues and poor repair quality. Now about a year and a half since the purchase, with regular cleaning and upkeep, I have experienced only one minor issue that I was able to resolve by some trial and error.

I am very satisfied with the machine - especially considering the price point. I easily average one extraction a day so now having made 500 extractions is a conservative estimation. The steam wand is weaker than more expensive machines, but it can sufficiently froth milk (even 2%) for simple latte art.

The risk that you may receive a defective copy aside, this is as easy a recommendation as there is for a home espresso machine."
827,5.0,2020-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Had to work on both the grind size in the basket and the grind size on the side to get the right espresso range pressure. Has to be a fine grind
828,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Want to boost office morale? Have everyone pitch in and buy one of these. This espresso machine has made everyone in my office happy. While there is a bit of a learning curve to get the coffee grind set and packed just right to get the ideal pressure for espresso, once you get that dialed in, you are ready to go. Within a week of tinkering, we were making restaurant-quality cappuccino. It takes less than five minutes to finish a cup, and clean up is a breeze.

So far, I love everything about this espresso maker.

UPDATE: About 3 months in, the pump in this machine mysteriously stopped working. I sent it back to Breville for warranty service, and they repaired and returned it quickly to me. Unfortunately, the repair did not fix the problem. I got back on the phone with Breville, and they sent me a brand new replacement machine, no extra cost, no hassles, in two days. Wonderful customer service."
829,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just got my machine today and am very happy, makes coffee strong mind you I had an Italian brand that begins with a D and went through 4 machines before they decided to give me a refund
UPDATE: I have had this machine for almost 4 months now and it is still running like new and the good thing is that it tells you when and what to maintain. A little more costly but its well worth it. UPDATE 9 MONTHS LATER AND STILL RUNS LIKE NEW, trick is to clean promptly when cleaning light turns on, ADVICE, buy an extra steam ring gasket or 2 because after about a year they wear out BUT the machine is THE BEST
UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!! Its been 1 year and still runs like new!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
830,5.0,2022-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"No pressure, coffee taste awful, takes over 30 min to warm up. Horrible experience"
831,4.0,2021-12-09, Black Sesame,"Works great overall and is easy to use once you get it adjusted how you like it, and get used to it.

Only complaint is the grinder, the opening between the cup and the burrs is really narrow, so I have to manually shuffle the beans sometimes with my finger while grinding to ensure they go down to the grindy parts."
832,5.0,2020-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect
833,5.0,2016-07-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this machine about 4 years ago and its still running like a champ as long as I maintained the proper instructed cleaning and service care, I never missed my morning latte. I roast my own coffee almost every other day and i have tried many espresso machines but nothing comes close to this. Now 4 of my family and 2 friends also purchased it after they tried my latte and they're very happy with it. Thanks."
834,5.0,2021-10-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We’ve had ours for about 6 months now and could not be happier. Makes an excellent espresso in no time and with super simple clean up. Everything about it is robust and well designed. The built in grinder works flawlessly and is easy to disassemble and clean. There is a hidden compartment for all the little bits, so everything stays tidy. The included instructions are clear and well illustrated.

My favorite is to do an Americano by pulling a double through the single basket (essentially a Longo), then adding hot water to taste.

I don’t do many milk drinks, but when I have it produces plenty of steam and I have no problem getting a fine foam."
835,5.0,2017-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel, Bought this as a birthday present for my husband. Weve been eyeing on this espresso machine for a while and finally we bought it. We worked at dunkin donuts so we know how to make good espresso drinks and so far we are inlove!!! Super easy to use and somehow it kinda gives you a barista vibes everytime you make latte lol. I also like how sleek looking it is! Perfect when guest comes over!!!! ❤️
836,5.0,2020-11-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update 6/19 This does a great job for the price. I am very happy with it once got familiar dialed in my process. Trick is to use good non oily beans, keep it CLEAN, always use manual setting where you hold button and do your own pre infusion. I'm grinding on #6 and about 16 grams of coffee grounds in and about 30 grams out in 30-35 sec including pre infusion I'm very happy with it now

Old and initial review. “Great attempt at making an all in one. The weak link is definitely the grinder and CS. I am going on my third warranty claim in three months and and the worst part is it takes 10 days on every turn around they do not rush anything. Customer service at Breville is horrible. The machine for the most part is pretty impressive for a little toy but the grinder was under designed. The most frustrating part out of everything is the poor customer service an attitude I have received for every problem"
837,4.0,2020-12-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Still learning and exploring this machine, but auto grind does not work. I have to hold it in so it keeps grinding beans and then stop at the right moment. I ended up using scales and measuring scoop to feed exact amount of coffee for each shot. So no guessing. But at this price point all functions should have been tested and working"
838,5.0,2015-08-03, Black Sesame,"Best investment I've made this year and I've bought soon cool things this year. Doesn't miss a beat. As long as you clean it and maintain it. I honestly stopped going to coffee shops because they can't make a better cup than this machine. Even the place where I buy my beans I like how I make mine better using the exact same brand as they do. And believe me I know my coffee. I never in a million years thought it would replace my favorite coffee shops. The crazy thing is I am not doing anything clever. I have my grind set at 2, set the amount to grind so I don't waist coffee neat my milk to 140 then extract my double shot. Pour the shot into my cup first and then milk on top. Easy. I use Zoka coffee beans. Everyday I get a consistent cup. Very impressed. Because at coffee shops my coffee would always be different and it would frustrate me because I want my cup to be a certain way every time. not over extracted or burnt or milk over heated or something else."
839,5.0,2022-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I loved this machine from the moment I got it but I waited a bit to review it to see if the infatuation wore off. It didn’t. Still love it.
Listen, this is a great machine but it’s not for everyone. It is not ‘plug and play’. There is a learning curve.
We had to watch a bunch of YouTube videos and do a lot of tweaking to calibrate the machine. And we’re still tweaking occasionally. Once it’s all set up it’s amazing but if you like the simplicity of capsules this might frustrate you. BUT like I said it’s awesome once is set up and I absolutely love it.
I mostly drink Americanos and my wife mostly drinks lattes. It does both exceptionally well. I feel like I could get rid of my coffee maker and just use this.
Zero complaints. Very solid build."
840,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"This is the best espresso machine I've ever owned! It took a little bit to find the right portions of grinds and the size of the grinds. But now it makes perfect espresso!

I don't like how the filters need to be replaced so soon. I wish it would come with a more permanent filter or replacement filters. Everything else is perfect! I make lattes every day."
841,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very easy to use and clean
842,5.0,2021-09-27, Black Sesame,"I'm mostly a non-coffee drinker, but recently had a cappuccino at a quaint little coffee shop, and it was life-changing! Because of that experience, I bought this machine based on reviews (and partly on looks... it's badass) and set out to learn how to make great espresso and cappuccino. The instructions are clear and concise, with detailed trouble-shooting to aid in perfecting your pour. I'm now a complete novice, making amazing coffee! Probably my favorite self-gift EVER!"
843,1.0,2019-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We ordered this machine and there was an option to buy it used or new. We paid the extra money for it to come new. When it arrived it was obviously used. But not just used, it looked like it had never been cleaned. It was disgusting, there was coffee all over it and all over the inside of the box. It looked like someone had just shoved the machine back inside the box and then kicked the box down the stairs. Even if we had chosen the used option, I would be dissatisfied with that, it was so gross. I hate to leave a bad review because it might be a great working espresso machine, but we don’t know because we had to return it."
844,5.0,2021-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was a barista for years, so the learning curve wasn't so bad for me. I was able to teach my husband how to use the machine pretty quickly. We've both been impressed with how consistently good the lattes we make are every single time.

I had no idea that this machine would make drinks just as good as I could make in my barista job. I didn't have that expectation, but it totally makes coffee that consistently good. I'm really happy and impressed. Would definitely recommend buying this. I know it's expensive, but it's worth it IMO."
845,5.0,2019-10-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a complete espresso machine for the perfectionist. It has a burr grinder with a generous hopper and has adjustable grind size and amount controls, a removable tamper, a steel coil water heating system and a very effective adjustable steam foaming wand. The top warms your cup, and the portafilter has four filters, one or two shot for grinder discharge or pre-ground coffee. The portafilter has two spouts like big commercial machines. A pressure gauge monitors grind and tamping performance. It comes with a frothing pitcher, and has a generous drip tray. It has a hot water dispensing spout. It even has a tray for excess filters and cleaning supplies that hides behind the drip tray. It provides enough controls that allow minute tailoring of drinks to taste. This is the finest moderately priced (under $1000) espresso machine available. It is not automatic, but that would take the fun out of it. Nobody buying this machine will experience buyer's remorse - it's that good."
846,5.0,2020-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,It is the greatest espresso machine I have ever owned. Once dialed in for grind level and amount it makes amazing esspresso.
847,4.0,2021-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I bought this to replace an older Cuisinart espresso machine that I had for years. This Breville espresso machine isn't so bad, but you have to wait a least 15-20 minutes to make sure the coffee drips hot. Otherwise, your coffee will be slightly cold after making a cup. Another thing is that, I sometimes like to make a taller cup of an espresso coffee, and you can't have that feature for a single cup of coffee. You need to press the double cup button to make one taller single cup of coffee. Maybe I'm not to sure how to change this function, but I am still learning how to use this thing."
848,5.0,2018-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine and believe it was worth the money. I no longer stop at my work’s Starbucks store; I’ve already saved about a quarter of what the machine cost. It is a bit tricky to clean, so watch some videos."
849,5.0,2022-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My first one lasted 14 years.
I just bought a new one without considering other Expresso Machines. It is that good."
850,5.0,2016-08-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the best appliance I’ve ever gotten.
It is smaller than I thought it was. It fits perfectly where my old regular coffee maker was.
Easy to use and the coffe it makes, OMG it is freaking delicious. I even got some decaf coffee so I can drink more of it through the day or even in the evening.
I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in making coffee as a hobby.
We’ve made so many friends with this machine. The neighbors come by to chat very often. I’m sure the coffee has something to do with that."
851,5.0,2020-03-29, Black Sesame,"First off, make sure you read the directions. Even if you're familiar with making espresso on another machine, the directions help you to know how fine to grind, which pressure you should pull the shots, and how to let it warm up ahead of time. If you do everything according to the directions, you will get some great coffee-house type shots and can make some delicious drinks at home. The price is a bit steep, but if you are used to purchasing coffee elsewhere, it will pay for itself fairly quickly."
852,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Someone once wrote if they had theirs stolen, they'd buy another the same day. Our sentiments exactly."
853,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Barista Express is easy to use, easy to clean, makes excellent espresso (assuming you use good beans) and the steam wand works great. The grinder does an excellent job. My only question is, when grinding coffee, why don't the grounds drop directly into the center of the filter? They drop a bit to one edge, which means the filter becomes over-filled before the right amount of coffee has been delivered. I have to stop grinding, tamp down a bit then do another small grind to get the right amount. Otherwise, it's fantastic."
854,5.0,2022-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'll just add my opinion about this espresso maker to those who've had good luck with it. Right out of the box, I set it up, set the grind size and volume to the desired settings (after the initial water and purge set up) and pulled a great shot. I was stunned.

The machine couldn't be easier to use or easier to understand. It's the best of the machines that I've owned; which have been the EC155 by Delonghi and the Saeco Poemia.

I've heard things about the grinder like it will get clogged and be a hassle to clean out and things but I've been using Sweet Marias green beans and not charring them like Starbucks does and getting great results.

The beans really do make a great difference.

I ran out of Sweet Marias this morning so I used some Charbucks beans and the difference was almost undrinkable. The crema, and the taste were miles apart.

If you get this (or any) machine, do yourself a favor and buy some green beans and an air popcorn popper and roast some beans.

All in all it's a great unit."
855,5.0,2021-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Arrived this evening and made my first cup. Never used a machine like this before, but easy to set up and use. I was so happy to see crema. I used the same coffee beans earlier in the day with a nutribullet to grind and french press to serve. The beans were completely transformed by this machine. I was amazed by the difference in taste. I'm starting to look at life with a whole new perspective. What other potential can be reached with the right tools? Too much? Well, this is a great bit of machinery, well built, that I would highly recommend making an investment in."
856,5.0,2021-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have wanted a cappuccino maker for a long time. This machine is absolutely fabulous (along with the Lavazza coffee beans). It is worth every penny!
857,5.0,2015-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Going on 3 years creating delicious drinks almost every day. It looks and runs like brand new. It’s a joy to operate and very easy to clean. It has also paid for itself in money saved on retail drinks. You gotta love that!
858,5.0,2021-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine. Once you get familiar with it you will truly enjoy
859,5.0,2020-05-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been drinking drip coffee for most of my life, but wanted to try something new since I'm the only coffee drinker in my household. Four days and about 15 Americanos in, I'm very happy. Every cup and grind is consistent, and although the machine does take up a lot of counter space it takes less than my old Ninja Coffee Bar + bean storage + grinder set-up. Although reading the manual once through is helpful, the Barista Express is really very easy to use. I was also pleased to find that although it is more noisy than a drip coffee maker, the noise level is still tolerable for 5:00 AM use."
860,1.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"we only used it 3 times and every time we used it the water compartment leaks, we can't leave water in it so we have to use and empty the water tank, luckily I saw it right away or it would have damage my cabinet, and it makes very very little espresso (I know espresso its small but this barely fills up to 1/3 of the espresso cup) and not a lot of crema, very disappointed because by the time we used it for the first time I had lost my return window."
861,5.0,2021-10-12, Black Sesame,"I don't generally write reviews, but I was so impressed, I felt I had to write one about this machine. I ordered my Breville Expresso machine two days ago and it already arrived. It was easy to unpack and is very easy to use. I ordered the stainless steel and it looks great with my other appliances and I was Impressed with the quality of the machine.The froth is better than anything I have ever had at Starbucks or any other upscale espresso store. The The espresso comes out strong and tasty and perfect for a latte. I previously owned an espresso machine from DeLonghi that cost $400 more than this one and I would say that this is a much better value for your dollar and the lattes and come out far and above the one from my previous machine. The order came with a filter, four filter baskets, a milk cup for frothing, cleaning kit, razor to level the coffee and an instrument to compact the coffee. Definitely a good value for the money. I highly recommend this machine."
862,5.0,2021-05-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There are lots of little bells and whistles that make this worth every penny. The grinder is very adjustable as is amount. All very high quality pieces and easy to use.
The best thing is guaranteeing consistency.
Being able to refine your latte or breve is priceless.
Not to mention I WAS paying $7.35 every day and it was hit and miss at best.
TIP: only use bottled drinking water and do not use well water, tap water or any water high in minerals."
863,5.0,2020-08-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"All I can say is WOW!! Was unsure about spending the money on this, but super glad I did. My fiance and I we're spending $15 per day if not $30 at the coffee stand. Since we bought this we have not gone to the coffee stand. It actually tastes way better then the coffee stand. If you buy this it will not disappoint!!"
864,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband loves his Breville Espresso so much that this is his third one. This time he decided to look at other brands since it's been a while when he bought the last one. After looking at several different brands at various stores he decided on the Breville again. Both of his Breville Espresso last for over five years and he uses it on a daily basis. When he cleans the machine it's no problem and easy to operate. We originally bought it on sale at Macy's then later found it cheaper on Amazon. It was a good thing that my husband didn't unpack the machine because back it went to Macy’s. Amazon shipping took about a week an half but savings was worth the wait.
865,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville produces an excellent espresso with rich crema once you balance grind size, dose volume and compaction pressure. I did find that steaming milk is very slow if you are making multiple cups for family or friends. When making an americano, for example, I just use the microwave to heat the water while extracting espresso. The built-in grinder is also first class and convenient to use. I would recommend this product to all espresso enthusiasts who are willing to take the extra time, over a fully automatic machine, to satisfy their java needs."
866,5.0,2022-02-02, Black Sesame,"I used to buy a fancy latte in my hometown, graced with some of the best coffee shops in the nation. After months of using this machine during the quarantine I went back to a coffee shop and will never go back. I like my coffee so much better.

The machine works wonderfully, read all of the instructions in the booklet and call Breville if you have any issues, they helped us with a user issue when the Expresso was not pulling in the correct range.
Highly recommend this, one of the best purchases in all my Amazon shopping over the last decade!!!"
867,5.0,2021-09-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,I wanted one for a long time. Absolutely love it.
868,5.0,2022-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I did a lot of research on this product and other products in the similar class. I’m glad to say I’m very satisfied with my choice. I received the product today, and it was very easy to set up. I did have some knowledge prior to the purchase and set up, first use, and getting the most of the product, so I’m sure that helped. My first cafe con leche made was excellent. I used 5 as my blend setting and was able to achieve optimal pressure for the espresso shot the first time! Very pleased with this product and would highly recommend!"
869,5.0,2019-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great machine so far, I've made at least a couple of double flat whites every day for over 3 months now (approximately 400 shots, ~4 kilos of beans!) with no problems. It was pretty simple to dial in the grind size, dose, and tamp force after just a few shots. The included cheat sheet, along with a little internet research makes the process pretty straightforward. Avoid using dark, oily beans and use only medium roast, like a Koffee Kult Medium or a Lavazza Super Crema for the best results through the burr grinder. And don't grind the beans too fine, the grounds should feel like table salt or sugar, not like flour. I've come to the conclusion that the 'Italian' roast and other dark, oily, burnt, ground to a flour-like consistency coffees are an attempt to mimic the flavor of espresso with a drip machine...just get an espresso machine and grind medium beans fresh..."
870,1.0,2018-05-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve had the machine barely over a year. Used it about 10 times. Emptied the water and unplugged it to go on a vacation. Came back and the pressure gauge does not work. I’ve filled out a ticket with BreVille I’ve called I’ve had absolutely no response at all for an $800 machine. Horribly disappointed and would absolutely not recommend buying this product because it is sensitive and you are literally on your own when it stops working.
871,5.0,2021-02-09, Black Sesame,"I love my Breville!! After having this pretty baby, I barely go out to get coffee, not only because I can save money, most importantly, you can make your coffee taste 10x better then many coffee shops."
872,4.0,2016-03-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a great machines. Great for someone to learn about the in/outs of brewing espresso. Can however be very time consuming. If you get into the technique of weighing your beans and adding to hopper to then brew. Followed by a clean up. Not ideal for someone short on time.
873,5.0,2022-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Maybe it’s the caffeine talking but I can’t stress enough how much I love the Breville 870. Before Starbucks if I ruined the market are used to be a bit of a coffee connoisseur. Would visit all the coffee shops and have long conversations with the owners. I would find the best beans to use with a percolator or a French press. I would put a lot of time and thought into my coffee.
After Starbucks killed the market, I settled in to just using their service and occasionally making my own coffee on weekends.
Now that I have the Brevell 870 I’m enjoying coffee again the way I used to, without the inconvenience of spending too much time making a cup. It is surprisingly quick and easy to use. Cleanup is are so fast and easy.
Get this product it’s the best for the price. It will serve you well."
874,5.0,2021-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. I was a little on my toes after having read some of the reviews that report machines being faulty, but I have not regretted buying this one second. The coffee is delicious, the instructions are clear so it's easy to use (though I believe there's a mistake in the cleaning cycle description -- my machine beeps twice, not three times after completing the cycle). Made my (work from home) life so much better!!!"
875,5.0,2022-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been wanting an at home espresso machine for years. Finally was able to purchase this beauty and it has not disappoint. Pulls good espresso shots, good steam power. I have worked at craft coffee shops and also have taken classes so I was looking for an espresso machine that would fit my preferences but also not break the bank. I absolutely love this machine. I would recommend it. And it would not be too difficult for others who don't have much experience to use it!"
876,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I was really excited to get this as I wanted something small that I could use at home as well as my market events to also offer lattes in addition to just samples. I tried making a latte at home and this thing is sooooo slow. I could almost make that work but the steam wand NEVER got the milk hot. I steamed it for almost 30 seconds non-stop and my latte was warm at best. To be honest I wouldn't even be happy with this as my at home machine unfortunately. I do not recommend. I will be returning this and spending more for much better quality.
877,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you want to have a real coffee, this is the right one. Just make sure you turn it on and let it warm a few minutes before you use it. Good investment."
878,5.0,2022-04-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,This espresso machine has been a game changer for me. It’s extremely easy to use and I’ve already saved so much money not buying a coffee in the morning. The steamer works pretty well. I usually turn it on and let it wake up for about 8 seconds then get to steaming my milk. Takes longer that 20 seconds to hear the milk but it does a great job! You basically learn how hat works for you and how you like your coffee!
879,5.0,2020-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had the Breville BES870XL for about 4 months and wanted to wait at least this long before I wrote a review. With 4 months experience, I write the following:

The espresso quality comes out perfectly from this machine. For those who are complaining about ""bitter,"" I suggest that you buy freshly roasted beans from a local coffee house - not supermarket or packaged beans. Freshness counts. I also suggest a grind setting of 3 or 4 (generally speaking as some type of beans need adjustment). I am very happy with this product and the quality of the espresso it can make.

As far a maintenance, this machine is pretty easy to maintain. There is a warning light when it needs to be back-pressured cleaned with cleaning tablets. The bean hopper and grinder can be removed for cleaning but I have not had the need to do this yet.

So for me, it is now on to learning the art of ""latte art"" and distinguishing the subtleties in beans and their roasts.

In sum, the Breville BES870XL is well engineered and well made and has not let me down once.

Enjoy !!"
880,5.0,2021-01-19, Black Sesame,"Really makes great espresso. Nice thick, rich, golden colored espresso each and every time. At first it's going to be about trial and error once you get the correct grind setting and tamping pressure in order to get the machine to extract optimal espresso. But once you get it right, it's smooth sailing from then on. I also want to talk about its built in bur grinder. I notice there are a lot of reviews that talk negatively about the grinder and I was afraid it wouldn't grind coffee at an acceptable consistency. I'm happy that it's not the case. The grinder isn't a cheap $50-100 grinder, it's a lot better than that. It's not as good as an industrial grinder but it grinds beans as fine as you will need and at a fantastic consistency. It isn't a cheaply made grinder by any means so there is nothing to worry about. I recommend getting the 4 year extended warranty because it is an expensive piece of machine and you want to protect your investment."
881,5.0,2020-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to operate. Beautiful in black finish
882,5.0,2021-09-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine requires a little bit of effort in order to make the perfect cup! they have made it very easy to use and a lot of the guesswork was taken out with the range gauge. Technically I’ve only had the machine for 3 days but have personally made thousands of coffees during my bar tending years. It’s easy to use and with patience you’ll get it right!
883,5.0,2021-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Look no further. Makes cafe quality espresso. Yes, there is a short learning curve. But it works and looks great. For Starbucks French Roast, we are using #4 grind about 3/4 of the full grind amount. Works every bit as well as the more expensive machines. Just remember to keep her clean and follow maintenance instructions. You will use a lot of coffee and milk, so buy both in large amounts."
884,5.0,2015-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pros: Grinds beans well, makes great espresso, and froths/steams milk as desired.

Cons: Lots of cleaning. I feel I have to clean the whole machine every other day due to ground spillage and spatters of espresso. You also can't make espresso and steam milk at the same time, and the steaming wand has to 'charge' before you can use it. The espresso bean hopper on the top is not air tight so if you leave beans in there they can dry out pretty quick. I've taken to just putting in what I need for a double shot and keeping my beans separate."
885,5.0,2021-04-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am a coffee nut. I have made coffee with every device out there. I have a travel grinder, I pour over, aeropress, drip etc. I have always tried to get top quality coffee from home, and with fresh beans I get pretty damn good coffee. I just ordered this thing as a show-piece for my new kitchen. I literally unpacked it 15 minutes ago, and made my first Americano through it. It tasted better than anything I have tried to do myself and I'm talking YEARS of coffee through here. That was the first cup! I just made my first mocha, and it tasted like Starbucks. I am just praying the machine lasts the distance. It's only my first day and i'm in love."
886,5.0,2021-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was on the lookout for an espresso machine that could get me the same quality lattes at coffee shops and have not been disappointed. I would definitely recommend reading directions before using this machine for optimal use. It took me a while to get in the hang of it (in terms of finding the right grind size for my coffee, steaming milk, and tampering down my espresso properly), but once I did the results were beautiful!!

Also have to give a shout out to the frother - I've frother whole milk, almond milk, and oat milk and each time its fantastic!!"
887,1.0,2020-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For the price point, you’d think this would be a relatively hassle-free way to make coffee. You would be wrong. If you enjoy wasting hours and lbs. of coffee trying to get just a single decent cup, this is the machine for you. This machine does not work out of the box, and I had to contact customer support just to get it to turn on. I am going back to using my moka pot which I know can make consistent, delicious espresso.

Edit: as of one month of use, this machine no longer works."
888,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,We’ve had this machine for two and a half years and would buy it again a million times. It’s extremely sturdy and makes amazing espresso. I still do visit Starbucks every so often but the truth is I much prefer my own espresso or americano from my Breville. I can’t give this product enough stars!
889,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Takes 20 minutes to preheat. Takes multiple batches to figure out how to get the right pressure and crema. I ended up making a double shot with the single pressurized cup. You also have to change the grinding level of the grounds until you get that right. Takes some learning.
890,5.0,2021-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I previously had a Saeco super automatic. I had it for 5 years and it served me well. It died a month ago and I got this to replace it. I figured as rarely as I used the latte function it wasn’t worth complicating the machine with the auto latte function. All I drink is espresso and Americana’s.
This machine makes the best cup of coffee I have ever had! I lay awake at night with breathless anticipation for the morning.
Even though it is not a super automatic, I feel it is easier and tastier than my previous super automatic!"
891,5.0,2022-01-07, Black Sesame,"Love this machine. It's heavy duty, classy looking and works great. I make espresso or late for myself everyday. I strongly recommend this machine and have already done so with my friends and family. I noticed the price has gone up now since the pandemic has raged. I bought mine around April 2020, it was selling for about $600 so if it's selling for more, you gotta do your comparative analysis with other products and decide."
892,5.0,2016-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love having my own coffee shop at home and make my coffee as I like it!
Ps, Coffee Rum makes it super yummy!"
893,5.0,2022-08-03, Black Sesame,"I have had a good espresso machine for years and have spent a fortune on espresso drinks from coffee shots, but this machine was life-changing. I know, a lot to claim for an espresso machine, but it is easy to use, easy to customize, easy to clean, and most importantly turn out amazing espresso and cappuccino. My only regret is that I waited so long to buy it."
894,4.0,2019-10-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,The black is more glossy than matte. Looking at the photos here I was under the impression it would be a matte finish which is why I went for that one over the stainless version. If you get annoyed by finger prints and smudges get the stainless steel version.
895,5.0,2022-03-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I originally purchased one of these, maybe 6 years ago. It served me well but after daily use it just got tired. After researching a replacement, I ended up back where I started. This machine is easy to use and will brew consistently good espresso. My recommendation is that you take the time dial in the machine and learn how to create espresso. This isn't a machine for quick coffee. It is a machine for someone that enjoys ritual and has patience to wait for their morning brew. Make sure to clean it regularly and change the water filter and it will not disappoint."
896,5.0,2020-11-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great
897,3.0,2021-10-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wanted to love this so badly, but unfortunately I can’t spend so much to try to get the coffee correctly or that none had a problem. It was very hard and sometimes impossible to get a perfect expreso. I moved the grinder a lot of times, changed the quantity and bought even five different type of coffee. Almost always the coffee run too fast. Even when the extraction was perfect-which happened very few times- I didn’t get the creams that I saw in so many reviews and videos.
I called the support and they helped me trying to changed the temperature of the water, since it seems that was the only thing that I didn’t try. However, even though I tried quite a lot of times and spent a lot of coffee in the process, I never got the cream and sweetness of the expresso coffee.

It was very easy to use but this is made for experts, people that have easy access to fresh roast coffee. Although, I think my unit had to have a problem."
898,5.0,2022-09-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machinr for about a month. I really like it. It makes a good cup of espresso. If you are having trouble with pressure and use the double wall. I struggled with that and trying to get the right ground, amount etc etc and just couldn't get it nailed down so after reading maby reviews and watching videos many said to use the double wall.

Foams milk well.

Also, sometimes the beans get stuck in the grinder. I give it a tap on the top to get them to settle in. It's new so it shouldn't need cleaned yet."
899,5.0,2020-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is way more than I thought it would be. Full-bodied shots, with beautiful crema. I researched for weeks and finally came down to this machine or the Infuser. So glad I got this one. And in case anyone is wondering, it steams homemade almond milk PERFECTLY... and yes, I can make latte art with my non-dairy deliciousness! I've used both coconut milk and almond milk with no problems at all.

Also, in response to people who have had issues with getting the pressure up, I found the trick. In the Quick Start Guide it mentions letting some steam out of the steam wand for 10 seconds, but nowhere else in the instructions does it tell you to do this again. So I assumed it was a one-time-deal, to prep the new machine. However, I found this step is key to perfect pressure every time. I flow one shot of water through the group handle (to warm the portafilter and clear out any residual coffee grounds), THEN I run the steam wand for approximately 10 seconds. Voila! Perfect shot every time!

I have my grind set to 4 and my grind amount set to 5 o'clock."
900,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE (March 3, 2020):

I originally had delivery issues with refurbished projects that Amazon sent to me, two separate machines, in fact. First defective machine could not come up to pressure, and the second had a broken water tank.

I wanted one so bad that I dropped an additional $100 for a brand new Breville Espresso Express that I received a few days later. It's been two months since I've began using it. I haven't had any issues either my grinding, brewing or milk steaming. It does exactly what it says it's supposed to do, and does it well. I've enjoyed the experience of learning to dosing, tamping, brewing and milk steaming / frothing. I've used it so often that I made sure to descale it at least once already with White Vinegar, which is meant to be done monthly.

I would suggest that for the price, this is certainly a good machine. I would suggest to do as I did, purchase an extra warranty that will extend your machine's warranty by four years. Components in the machine will eventually breakdown, and the expense to fix it will be high. In case it doesn't make it, I can always get a replacement machine in the next 5-6 years which is a great investment.

------------------------------------
Original Review:

I received my first Breville Espresso Express two days ago only to waste half a bag of beans to find out that the pressure gauge was defective. This was determined after conducting a pressure test recommended by Breville. I took it to Kohl’s to be returned.

The replacement arrived this afternoon only to be broken. The water tank was broken in many different places. After speaking with customer service, I was told that it was simpler to just receive a refund rather than another replacement. These are photos of my replacement.

This was by far one of my worst experiences with any product or service. All I wanted was to make a shot of espresso."
901,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is a great value and makes an incredible espresso. I'm going from a superautomatic that wasn't pulling strong shots but was convenient. The pressure gage helps out making the perfect shot because it does take some practice getting the tamp and grind right. Once you get it right its very consistent. The espresso has a real crema and creates a full body espresso. I used the same beans in the super and this one and they tasted nothing like each other. In the picture the espresso from the Breville is on the left.

The ability to program the temperature and volume are nice and the ability manually override the volume is convenient. The hot water dispenser is convenient and makes an Americano simple. Most of my guests don't really like straight espresso. This is my first machine that didn't have a pannarello frother but like the espresso part once you get it right it's much better. The foam is a true microfoam that I wasn't getting with the pannarello."
902,4.0,2020-11-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Everything about this Espresso maker is great except for the serving output that's not consistent. ""Double"" sometimes is equal to ""Single"" output. It takes no time to get the temperature ready for a hot cup of coffee. Very user friendly, easy to clean. This is one of the best investments in my kitchen!"
903,1.0,2019-08-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Unfortunately the machine is defective and even worse, Breville support is unprofessional and unresponsive to the support ticket that was opened. It’s been over 10 days since I opened a support case and have yet to hear from anyone. Also avoid the seller Happy Haus as they are useless. Expect Amazon to ghost you unless you buy from them directly horrible all around and I’m stuck with a $750 useless machine. Thanks for nothing"
904,3.0,2021-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It was OK in the beginning, for a few months, and then stopped the pressuring, pressure-sucking thing.
No more cream.. Not worth it. I'd look for something else. I should've. The Co probably knows about, too, but they still peddling it."
905,5.0,2021-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We were very hesitant about this purchase since there are many lower priced options available. Additionally, we both like a plain, simple cup of coffee in the AM, not anything out of the ordinary. We've both had experience with Caffe Americanos and that is what we drink first thing in the morning now. No need for a ""regular"" coffee maker any longer and we could finally ditch the ""pod"" coffee maker.

The quality of the coffee this machine brews is exceptional, espresso and cappuccino just like we have experienced in our travels. The real selling point for us was the grinder which ensures fresh coffee with each cup.

This purchase was definitely worth every penny. An easy 5 star rating."
906,5.0,2018-05-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this espresso machine so much! I'm very happy with this purchase, and it has been working exquisitely for months. It's great fun to make lattés, espresso shots, and I even make steamed milk for the kids. I didn't know anything about espresso machines before this purchase, but it wasn't difficult to figure out. Watch the video that they have on the website, read the manual (it's written in a way that's easy to understand), and you'll be a pro in a couple days! Try different beans and brands too! I ended up finding my own mix of two brands/roasts for my perfect blend."
907,4.0,2021-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,It expels great flavor and is user friendly. The only issue I have is that I've noticed when I select the 2 cup size it gives me an amount of the one cup size and vice versa..I think during the manufacturing process they were switched around by accident ? I just seem to get more when I select the one cup. Maybe this is normal?? I dunno. I'm a newbie to the barista world.
908,5.0,2021-10-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife is delighted, this machine is perfect, it adorns my kitchen and prepares a quality of coffee that exceeds any expectation, very easy to use, the learning curve is short and it has everything"
909,5.0,2021-10-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"No regrets. This was an amazing purchase that has eliminated our need for Starbucks. It is extremely easy to use and the 1-page instruction sheet that comes with it is easy to read and is spot-on.

Cleaning the machine is a bit tedious but worth it. We have the stainless steel—looks amazing when clean, but we all know that stainless consistently needs to be cleaned of fingerprints.

I recommend buying a better tamper with your purchase. The one that comes with it is efficient but requires a lot of pressure to get the grounds compacted just right. I recommend getting a calibrated tamper. The Luxhaus is worth it."
910,5.0,2020-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,It looks amazing and makes a great latte
911,5.0,2022-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very easy to use, easy to clean and best of all my lattes are so much better than Starbucks. The best thing I truly ever purchased, wish I would have bought it much earlier."
912,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine about a month ago and feared that I would use it heavily at first, but after the novelty would fade I'd use it less and less until the machine finally would be relocated to the pantry with all of the other unloved small appliances my wife and I had acquired over the years... I'm happy to report that the opposite has been true - the machine is great and still sees daily use. I wish the bean hopper was a bit bigger, but aside from that, everything about the machine has been great and it hasn't left me with any feelings of regret post-purchase."
913,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great espresso maker! Very well made and has enough knobs and dials to satisfy my geekness, but easily makes great, consistent espresso drinks when in its ""auto-pilot"" mode. It fit under our kitchen cabinets with no problem which was a big concern. Having the adjustable grind timer is very convenient to reproduce a consistent fill every time. Don't get me wrong, you still have to tamp the grounds, fill the water hopper (its removable - I love it), press the buttons, knock out the grounds ""puck"", clean off the frother, empty the waste water tray, etc.. Lots of fun, if you ask me! BTW, it comes with a very nice stainless frothing pitcher so don't order one in addition (like I did). You will, however, want to order a nice clip-on short-stem thermometer for frothing milk to 140 degrees or you will end up with an under-temperature drink. If you read the directions that come with this espresso maker, you'll be a barista in no time!"
914,5.0,2022-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"In the past 20 years I have owned two other espresso coffee makers which cost considerably more than this Breville Espresso Machine. By far this machine makes the best espresso. It is easy to use but keep in mind it is not a totally automatic machine so you have to put a little effort into making a great cup of coffee. My only complaint is minor but it is that the machine is messy. I can't seem to make a cup of espresso without getting coffee grounds on my kitchen counter. Really not a big problem.
I would but this item again and recommend it to a friend."
915,5.0,2021-11-07, Black Sesame,I bought this 3 years ago and have zero regrets. My wife and I have used it daily for 3 years now and it has not had a single problem. It still works as good as new. This is a well built machine in my opinion and makes great espresso. I highly recommend this espresso maker. You get what you pay for with this machine.
916,1.0,2021-11-07, Black Sesame,"The machine worked fine yesterday. Today it crapped out. No pressure - no water flowing. Cleaning procedure didn't help. Call to Breville resulted in rep telling me my beans were too old and had me adjust the grind. I was suspect that this didn't have anything to do with the machine's pressure being non-existent. Call was dropped (or did the rep hang up on me?) Called back and talked with another rep. She walked me through pulling another shot (which I had already done many times before). Still no pressure - pressure gauge still not moving. No water flowing through group head. Rep said it has to be sent in for repair. Even though it's under warranty I'm not happy to be without my machine for several weeks. How can a $500 machine be manufactured to only work for 4 months? Such BS.

Update: I received another machine from Breville after 3 weeks of waiting with no communication. I have no idea if it was a refurbished machine or not, but it looked new. So from March 2020 to August 24, 2020 the machine worked fine. Today, August 25th, the machine doesn't work - again. This time, no water comes out of the group head. When the shot is being pulled it sounds fine at first, then there is a horrible rattling sound that continues for a bit. The pressure seems to be higher than normal on the gauge, but not out of range. No shot of espresso was produced. No water comes out of the group head at all. The steam wand works fine so the pump works. This machine was cleaned religiously on schedule, as was the first one. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD I WILL NEVER BUY BREVILLE PRODUCT - YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER. This machine is overpriced junk."
917,3.0,2017-08-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Nice attractive addition to the coffee bar. The espresso it makes is good. The grinder sucks so have your beans pre-gound, or use a external bean grinder. We have been using one for years and it works great. To steam your milk, you are far better off just putting it in a glass and microwaving it for 1-1.5 mins. The steamer takes for ever and it just doesn't get hot enough. The hot water is pretty much a joke. Its fine if you like luke warm espressor, lattes etc. It was a difficult debate to return or not return it. I chose to keep it the things that do not work adequately are easily remedied. I suspect many of the reviews are inflated as many buyers tails are wagging after making their first little espressos."
918,5.0,2018-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A bit of a learning curve but, so far, we appreciate the ease of use and consistency of the espresso. Excellent frothing of milk every time. We have had to stop a unclog the grinder a couple of times during use but we've gotten quicker and need to make the grind isn't set too fine. That turns out to be the problem each time. Around 4 on the grind setting produces a nice espresso for us. Have had to descale once and was surprised how quick it was. All in all, we are very satisfied and would recommend this machine for household use. We make three drinks a day."
919,5.0,2017-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing coffee maker. You can make anything with this machine. Coffee is super hot and very quick! Espresso blend Starbucks coffee tastes like you picked up your coffee at Starbucks! You my never go to Starbucks again since it can make you a speciality coffee like the store! Just pick up a few ingredients and your done! Enjoy this machine. The only thing I wish it has was a way to pipe water into it so you didn’t have to fill the tank. However, it easy to lift off and fill. If you place it near the sink you can use the sprayer to fill it. The tank comes with a nice filter so your water will taste even better."
920,5.0,2022-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is truly a great machine but it will certainly take practice and plenty of trial an error to brew the best espresso and froth the milk to perfection but once is dialed in the flavor is amazing.

Of of the things I disliked was the fact that the machines doesn't tell you when the water is low.

If you are always in a hurry then this machine is not for you, it will take some time to create a drink. I suggest you invest in a on automatic machine."
921,5.0,2020-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took me awhile to learn how to effectively set the grind size and grind amount so that I get the right pressure for that perfect espresso shot. I Utubed a lot, did some research, and then I read a review about getting the $20 weighted tapper off amazon. I ordered it and this seemed to make all the difference. I love my machine and the great coffee it makes every time. My advice...buy the tapper up front to avoid lots of frustration. The tapper it comes with didn’t work for me as I didn’t know the correct pressure that is needed."
922,4.0,2020-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Not too complicated to use, but is finicky to get a good cup of expresso. Would like my expresso hotter than this unit provides."
923,5.0,2017-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My roommate had this machine in storage from a handful of years ago. At one point there were 7 adults in our house using this machine on a daily basis, often times throughout the day. It never failed us. When the owner of the machine moved out and took it with her, I bought one in May of 2017 for the house. It continued to be a dependable and reliable source of espresso for us. Two years later, my husband and I are still using this amazing machine. It's easy to clean, maintain, and use. The money spent on this machine is well-worth it and the savings from not going to get coffee elsewhere are huge. If you are on the fence about ordering this machine, I say do it, 100%."
924,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Was a great Christmas gift for my girlfriend, she loves it, and she used to be a barista back in the day. Is a little time consuming to clean and maintain but it seems very well built and should last a long time if properly maintained. Great purchase and would highly recommend buying one - the price is a little steep but it is an awesome machine!"
925,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel," Ohhh lord this is heaven for my husband
I think we should get an extra gift from this company coz I recommended it with lots of my friends and they’re getting it too. They tried the coffee and SORRY NO MORE STARBUCKS FOR MY MAN
IT WILL EVENTUALLY GONNA PAID THIS OFF NO STARBUCKS 3x a day"
926,5.0,2018-10-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got the Breville a few months ago and I love it. It makes great coffee and is pretty easy to use. I only ever make double shots so have not really messed with single settings.

Here are the settings that worked for me and result in a good packed puck and great shot of espresso. Grind size = 2 and the Grind amount one notch below middle on the more side.

I highly recommend getting this machine. It makes wonderful espresso and lovely mocha. The foam is ok but not great enough for latte art.

The only downside is cleanup is kind of a pain. Expect to keep a kitchen rag handy."
927,2.0,2020-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have been using this model for a few years. We have 1 in 2 different residences and one in an office. The latest purchase was defective…the filter basket gets stuck up in machine and sometimes the suction is so strong you can’t even pry it out with your fingers. It’s an absolute mess and a burn hazard. Sent that machine back and ordered another one. SAME ISSUE. I’m going to try one more before I give up and purchase from another manufacturer. It’s frustrating, messy and a complete hassle."
928,5.0,2022-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent machine! I love my coffee to be really strong and this espresso machine certainly meets my expectations on each time I make my espresso. I've used espresso machines in the past. By far, it's THE BEST I've ever had. You get what you paid for. Right? This machine is certainly worth the price. Very user friendly. Very easily cleaned and maintained. Highly recommend!"
929,5.0,2022-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The best high quality espresso machine for home brewing. Great for novices who want quality espresso. The auto function makes pulling shots a no brainer. The semi-auto features also makes it a great machine for the more advanced (not the coffee snob, know it all) who want to control grind size, brew temp, profiling etc. It has Manual override system that lets you control preinfusion time, extraction time, allowing you to create brew profiles you want to experiment with. Not saying this is on par with the more expensive, pro-commercial machines that are at least double in price range, but as a prosumer home machine and price range, it is the best you can get. Been using the machine almost two years now, pulling at least 70 double shots a month with no problems, however, i do baby the macine (meaning take good care of it with regular decalcification, backwash group head and thorough grinder cleaning)"
930,5.0,2020-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning. Works as well as advertised. Purchased a less expensive one a year ago, so I was apprehensive about paying this much for one. But it was well worth it"
931,5.0,2020-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've waited years to buy an espresso machine. I wish I bought this 3-4 years ago when I started working from home. It takes a little effort to dial in but the machine is super intuitive. Don't expect perfect espresso right out the gate, you're going to have to put in some work to get it right. It's well worth the effort. I'm now making coffee that rivals some of our best coffeeshops.

Given the times we're living in (Covid-19), this machine has been incredibly useful and worth the price tag. Consider it if you have the ability to WFH."
932,5.0,2020-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had my unit over two years, it is used daily. After two year and an expired warranty, I called Breville because it was not dispensing the correct amount of water. The support rep listened to it and ask where she could send me a box to ship to them. The customer service is the best I have experienced in a long time. Unit was picked up, repaired, and returned in a little over a week. Hats off to Breville if you have any trouble, they will take care of you!"
933,5.0,2021-11-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"-I have the Barista Express for a year now and can say that I am very pleased with it. Works flawlessly. It takes little adjustment to get a great brew (pressure between 10 and 12 o'clock).
-Amount set at 12, fineness at 6 - this works for Pienaroma beans from Lavazza.
-Much better flavor than from the fully automated Jura Impressa C5, same beans.
-As many pieces of equipment, the Espresso machine REQUIRES MAINTENANCE !!
--> I am very tired of and disappointed at other consumers, who write bad reviews - even though the root cause of malfunction is skipped or incorrect maintenance in most cases.
-Coffee powder: do not fill the porta filter with ground coffee from Illy: it is ground too fine, resulting in pressure greater than the 12 o'clock position: coffee only dripping, not flowing; you can hear the espresso machine working hard to press the steam through the coffee powder. Besides the Illy coffee is way overpriced (double than Lavazza)."
934,5.0,2021-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My hubby loves his new expresso machine. He says it’s the best thing since sliced bread. Lol. We have 2 other expresso machines sitting on our kitchen counter but this one seems to make the best expresso, lattes, macchiatos, etc. The taste is just strong enough to make the perfect wanna-be Starbucks drink. The machine is a bit pricey but so far, it has lived up to its expectations. We use it every single day (multiple cups a day), so the machine will pay for itself in no time."
935,1.0,2020-09-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased BES870XL/A machine in 2017. Approximately one year later one of the stainless steel panels started rusting. It was a cosmetic issue. The rust came in tiny little specs like water droplets on the side of the machine. My guess is the acidity of coffee being sprinkled occasionally, in combination with the humidity in my city, led to the rusting issue. Breville customer support was excellent, responsive and fast. They said the rusting issue was highly unusual and I should just clean my machine better. I tried cleaning the machine for a couple of months, the rust came back, and before warranty was up, I asked for replacement.

The replacement machine worked well for about one year. Then it started leaking water from the bottom. I did not want to deal with replacing it again, so I watched YouTube videos and did online research about the leaking. Apparently the machine is full of gaskets, valves, tubes, a small pump and other water-control elements, each of which can cause a leak. And apparently these things leak a lot. I should also add that I have maintained my machine up to the highest standard. I followed all maintenance instructions in the user manual. I cleaned it regularly, decalcified it, and what not. We only have 2 regular users on the machine on a daily basis. So the water leak was not caused by poor maintenance or by excessive use. For all these reasons, I think the leak is caused by poor design and quality issues. If a small appliance gives you only one year of care-free usage, then it is not a good quality. I like my machine, but I need something that would give me 6-8 years of uninterrupted use. I don't want to deal with replacement parts, gaskets, opening and cleaning the guts, replacing tubes and researching valve mechanics. I need to find a better espresso machine. Do yourself a favor and shop around for something of higher quality."
936,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Just started using this. Easy to use.
937,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this based on reviews. I think the machine does what it says but the buyers have to keep several things into consideration. The milk steamer does take about 10-20 seconds to come one. I still cant get the perfect milt to do latte art. I've tried everything. The drip mesh needs to be cleaned after each batch of espresso as it gets dirty each time its used. the cleaning of the machine is time consuming. Even if you do a single batch of espresso, it requires cleaning the complete machine, or else risk wear and tear and not ideal working condition for your next batch. I spend more time cleaning this machine than actually make coffee. I was expecting something easier to operate.

However, the equipment comes very complete.

Overall, good equipment, good quality, just a lot of cleaning and maintenance for a cup of espresso."
938,5.0,2021-04-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This one Was lovely but for some reason wouldn’t reach the right pressure level for espresso, but I had no trouble at all returning and the seller was lovely. I ended up getting another one locally so that I would have it in time for the holidays and we absolutely LOVE it. So, bottom line is I recommend both the seller because they were so great about the return and the item because it s a fabulous machine. No idea why the one we got wouldn’t reach pressure, but I don’t think it was a typical problem to have with these."
939,4.0,2016-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Once you get the coffee dose tuned in its super easy to use. You’ll waste a little coffee at first but that’s with every espresso machine
940,2.0,2020-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pressure gauge just stopped working on month 8 of use and contacting Breville for support has been impossible so far.
Troubleshooting/Support:
Followed Support features to trace through and try to troubleshoot myself... Solution doesn't solve my problem.

First Try - Chat: Fill everything out then it closes the box and says no support available.

Second Try - Filing a claim: Rejects the order number associated with Amazon. Does not let me submit form. Missing lot number which is required as well.

Third Try - Calling Support: Currently on hold for over 25 minutes and they claim an average wait time of > 1 hour right now.

This is unacceptable and insufficient support. Also, a $700 espresso maker should not break within the first year of ownership. (Yes I regularly clean and descale. Yes I run to clear after use.)

Separate Issue - Did everyone else initially receive a generic box with parts loose in it? I almost think I was sent a refurbished unit for a full price. My allen wrench was missing, I had an extra 2 cup single wall filter basket, and the machine had a few minor scratches on it."
941,5.0,2022-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Still learning to use the machine. It has many nuances, so some of the quirks may be my lack of expertise with this machine. It makes great espresso and I like the consistent flavor. I also like the ease of use and how quickly I can enjoy an Americano. I also purchased a calibrated tamper, and that adds one level of consistency to my shots.
The machine was delivered a day early and that was a real pleasant surprise."
942,5.0,2017-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, great espresso, love the grinder. Love this machine 💋"
943,5.0,2022-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really debated getting this espresso machine because I thought it was a bit pricey. If you’re thinking the same, get it. It is the best machine ever. Not only is it easy to use but all the functions work perfect. Water tank lasts for a few drinks depending what you make. The streamer works awesome and I can make creamy lattes. If I want an americano, the hot water is hot. Automatically grinds and once you get the settings right, you get consistent and perfect espresso shots. I love it and would recommend it 100%."
944,5.0,2020-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely loving my new Breville Espresso machine! I feel like I have my own cafe in my home! So easy to use and it’s beautiful 😍I make my daily coffee using it even to create lattes and regular coffee by doing multiple double shots with one serving of coffee grinds. It has just become a favourite for all of us at home...my 2 teen girls think they are baristas. ❤️❤️❤️
945,5.0,2019-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee! so good we bought another one for the daughter.
946,5.0,2021-06-03, Black Sesame,"Can I rate it 10 stars 🌟 ✨ I love this one product so much. It can get messy but it’s no biggie. The silver metal frothing cup was kind of a deal breaker because it was so tiny but it’s ok, it makes delicious espresso shot and perfect lattes. It feels so heavy duty compared to delonghi. I purchased the 3 year warranty because of some reviews saying it only last a year or two. I haven’t been to starbucks in a month! I keep it clean no matter how busy I am. The grinder grinds the beans perfectly. Brat Christmas present for my self ever!"
947,5.0,2018-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,I'm not sure how to begin describing this quite amazing product. Being almost 60 I have learned over the many seasons in life that you get what you pay for. Sometimes your expectations are far exceeded and thus my dilemma! In short I have been doing it all wrong since 1969 when I brewed my first cup of Joe. What I both learned and experienced with this product is a value that far exceeds the cost of the unit. They say knowledge is power and backed by a proper pull or shot of expresso I believe our species has a chance haha. You will not be disappointed if you are willing to learn and take the time to perfect your skill. It took us about an hour to dial it in to that perfect cup so be patient and experiment. Everybody is different and does not like coffee the same way. This will give you a full range of possibilities you never dreamed were possible at home. Pictures will come later
948,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this as an anniversary gift for my son & daughter in law. She works at Starbucks & immediately went to assembling it & making coffees! My husband started using it too & It worked perfectly & she loves it so it was a perfect gift! - love Breville products!
949,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Like the title says delicious yummy ass coffee
950,5.0,2020-07-18, Black Sesame,"It is a beautiful machine. Sure, it's expensive ( gave it to ourselves for our 18th anniversary). To save time, we watched YouTube video's to learn all the little tricks, uses and most of all.... how to get that foam just right! (it's not hard to do, but there is a little learning curve) no matter, it's a keeper for us! Nice strong Americana's (reg. cup of coffee), cappuccinos, espresso's ....all pretty quickly too. I love the hot water tap. My hubby has now got the foam just right consistency so there is still some foam throughout drinking the coffee, but you don't have to have foam if you don't want. I haven't done it enough to get the foam right yet, but it is been sorta fun and the result is worth it."
951,5.0,2021-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have wanted one for years, finally took the plunge. Does not disappoint! We love it! When dialing it in just make sure to also adjust the Bar grinder inside the machine along with the grind setting on the side. That had me stumped for a while when I first got it."
952,4.0,2020-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine, makes a creamy espresso. Get a bean you like and stick with it because you don't want to fiddle with the settings every time you add beans. Espresso roast makes the best crema, but I've had luck with dark roast too. Oily beans get stuck in hopper, so I would not recommend those. ""Clean me"" light just went on after a month, so I'll repost that process soon. A little awkward with the tamper on the left, you find your arms crossing to replace it. Not a big deal, though. I only grind one shot, then tamp it a little and add more so the little mountain of grounds does not make a big mess. I enjoy the slightly automated, slightly ""you have to have some skill"" aspect of this espresso machine."
953,5.0,2020-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Yes this is a bit pricey but well worth it. You will make the best espressos at home with this machine. It takes a bit to master but with patience you will get it. Use good beans and you will make better espressos than at most espresso coffee shops.

The one thing that I was surprised about is how much water is ""wasted"" I understand this is a single boiler espresso machine and as such it has to ""bleed"" out excess water when making steam vs hot water. The water is all caught in a desiccated tray, so it's not like there is water going everywhere, but I find myself having to empty the tray more often than I expected. This is all a very small inconvenience for an amazing machine."
954,5.0,2021-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We were 3x a day Starbucks people. Bought 4 months ago. Best decision we ever made. Besides each other 😉
You won’t be disappointed, it took some research to figure out how to use. And get the 12 o’clock pressure. We are not savvy baristas but did figure it out. Join the club it’s the best thing ever. Also the hours don’t vary.!"
955,5.0,2021-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been using this machine roughly once a day for over a month and it's probably one of the smartest investments I've ever made. While it does assume a degree of familiarity with the process, it's easy to learn to use if you thoroughly read and follow the instructions. I don't recommend for beginners, but for those that are accustomed to using a machine like this, it's a breeze. Very happy with the purchase."
956,5.0,2021-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is no way I can describe this better than the other reviews on here, as some people have done a great job summarizing and reviewing the machine. After going through all the reviews, I decided to pull the trigger, and there are no surprises. The other reviews were spot on on what you are going to expect.

I've been using the machine for over 6 months now, every single day, about 3 cups a day. The maintenance is easier than a fully automatic Philips Saeco HD8833 (EU) before this."
957,2.0,2020-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine was leaking water right from the start. Slowly but surely the tool tray was filling with water, while the machine sat idle on the counter top. After a few days, this leak led to a short circuit somewhere so the machine started triggering the circuit breaker and became unusable by day three.

Called Amazon support, they forwarded me to Breville support, and they promised to ship a new machine (in exchange, I should ship this one back). The phone call was on Friday morning, the shipment has not gone out nearly a week later. This is despite an email from Breville that the shipment will happen 1-3 business days from Friday. Another hour on hold with Breville support, and they clarified that I was ""misinformed"" about the shipping timeline and the machine will ship soon. That happened after they tried to explain to me how to count business days properly, and that 1 to 3 is sometimes 4 or 5. No apologies and no regrets from them.
Will see how this turns out...

While the machine worked I started to get better at making espresso, and the coffee is good (I guess as good as one's skills). There is ample functionality to make great drinks. It is a shame that reliability seems to be an issue."
958,5.0,2017-08-03, Black Sesame,"I wasn't a coffee fanatic by any stretch but I found a great a Great coffee roaster in Eagle River Wisconsin I really enjoyed. Their coffee DOGS any Seattle coffee but I never could make what they make...UNTIL NOW!
I use only Eagle River Roaters fresh beans in this Espresso machine and its MAGIC!
I believe even culinary school doesn't make you a barista but a Great maker can. I read many reviews and took into account that many disatiffied consumers negated the warranties Amazon offers and has on occasion taken EXCELLENT care of us on.
I chose this maker after extensive research so I could choose the heat of the milk by touch, dialing in taste by preference and the ""Hands On"" that true cooks love.
BEST ESPRESSO, CAPPUCCINO, TEA, BLACK COFFEE, I've ever had. Worth 5X the price."
959,2.0,2018-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I so wanted to love this machine with it's builtin grinder, sexy stylish looks, compact design and fancy technology. But it failed me, with the first cups of espresso which were under pressure, which didn't produce any crema.....etc. Finally after all the fine tuning for a few hours and watching instructional youtube video, we got some lousy tiny shots of espresso which were nothing spectacular. After 5 days the machine stopped pumping the water through the coffee instead it was dumping it all into the water reservoir. I called the tech support, nice guys, who offered to open a warranty claim. I said I was just going to return it. The machine with a $600 price tag was making lattes worse than our good ol' Delonghi.
My complaints are:
1. The grinder in the Breville machine makes sooooo much mess.
2. The fine tuning for a perfect shot is a very delicate process. (I have to be honest, I am not a total newbie, but this was hard to figure out. We wasted quite a lot of coffee beans on just figuring out the right amount and the right grind). So after all the tuning you may still get a very small shot of espresso. This might be my unique experience if my machine was defective from the very beginning. I never got to fully appreciate the benefits of this machine that everyone talks about.
3. The milk frothing was great. It's fast, hot, efficient. Hands down.
4. Why does half the water tank end up in the bottom tray? Does it really take half the water tank for the machine to release pressure? Just as much water to actually make coffee?
5. One of the selling features - hot water dispenser was a disappointment. It's not very efficient if you want to use it for a cup of tea. It's only for adding water to your americana or whatever you need during espresso making process."
960,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,It takes a while to get used to and to get the hang of using it. After trial ans error we finally made a perfect espresso drink. I cant even enjoy outside coffee anymore. Highly recommend 👌
961,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased this machine in 2021. We use it every single day, multiple times a day. We clean it monthly and maintain the machine well because this machine is worth it’s weight in gold.
I am giving it three stars because it’s been so good to us over the years.
But here we are a couple years later and it’s busted. So now we’re buying the pro. Hoping that gives us a little more life!"
962,5.0,2021-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This product is wonderfully designed. Everything about it. Even the fold up handle on the water tank is well thought out and implemented ! It makes a great Latte . Yes, it has a earning curve. It took me a while to get the grind amount perfect. I never frothed milk so I had to learn how best to do that. After a week, it is one of my most prized possessions !"
963,5.0,2018-11-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ever since I started volunteering at our church coffee house I've been wanting an espresso machine. I reviewed a ton and decided on this one. i am very pleased with it. It is louder than I would have likes. Vibrated when heating up and while pulling the shot. You can't steam milk and pull the shot at the same time, and it takes a fair amount of time to steam the milk. That being said, it does make a really good shot and steams the milk better than the several thousand dollar machine at church. It's much easier to control the amount of air. I keep caffeinated beans in the hopper for my family, but I drink decaf. I like the flavor of coffee, but can't tolerate the caffeine. So I grind my coffee in a separate grinder, and find there to be no difference in the shot. Excellent machine for the money."
964,5.0,2021-06-22, Black Sesame,What an amazing machine! I have now been using this for a year and a half and I absolutely cherish it. It continues to turn out the perfect shot of espresso day in and day out. I suggest following the recommendations of a previous reviewer to buy a pack of Amazon basics washcloths and the Breville dump bucket for grounds. This machine has paid for itself many times over by saving me trips to Starbucks. I don’t know what I would do without this machine.
965,5.0,2021-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the second Breville I bought. My old one broke due to an electrical surge, and it was time to replace it. I looked at a lot of machines under $1000 - and after extensive research, I concluded that the Breville is the best in that price category. Exceptional coffee, great crema, easy to maintain, and looks absolutely stunning in the kitchen (see the pictures). Don't think twice - this is the one to get. You will not be disappointed!"
966,3.0,2022-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We generally really love our Breville machines, but this most recent one has proven to be challenging. Initially the cleaning function stopped working and then the grinder spontaneously stopped. When we reported this to Breville, they asked us to send the machine back to them and they fixed without charge, with no explanation as to what had gone wrong. We were not charged and were happily awaiting the return of our machine. Unfortunately they returned it without the water reservoir, the drip tray and the bean hopper. They promised to send new drip and hopper but that they had to back order the reservoir. We continue to be without a machine and still have no idea what happened. I'm happy with the quick service from Breville but I would like better communication."
967,5.0,2021-11-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I read tons of reviews before purchasing. I haven’t been to Starbucks ever since. I make sure I use it for some time before putting up a review. Overall a good machine, no complaint and a easy to manage if you read instruction. Make sure you order the filter and descale tablet because you will eventually need it."
968,5.0,2021-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this unit just over a year ago and to date I have been thrilled. I make between 2-4 double shots every day. I use the steam wand at least twice a day to steam milk. I do the routine maintenance as recommended in the manual and have a water softener. I feel like it is very important to have softened water as mineral deposits in hard water will shorten the life of any appliance especially a unit like this. There is a bit of a learning curve but I thought it was fun. The first few I made were pretty bad but as time (few days) went on I was making great cappuccino's and latte's. My artwork still needs work but the flavor is there.

Would I recommend this unit.....YES."
969,4.0,2022-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes good coffee. But be prepared to spend a lot of time cleaning. It also dumps about 2x the amount of water into the drip tray as it does making actual espresso, so you’ll be emptying it about every other day."
970,5.0,2015-10-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Our family is enjoying the Breville espresso maker. It is easy to use and makes delicious drinks. I was concerned that it would be hard to use, but it is not and even our teenage boys use it. I highly recommend this machine. It is also a beautiful appliance on my counter and I find it easy to clean."
971,5.0,2019-03-22, Black Sesame,Previously owned a Quick Mill Silvano machine. After messing with that machine for a year I sold it very frustrated. About 1 out of every 10 shots tasted great. The other 9 were terrible. The experience turned me off of espresso machines for almost two years. I finally decided to get back into it and bought this Breville after a lot of research. It took about 1 1/2 bags of coffee to learn how to make a perfect shot. Now after having this machine for 2 weeks I can pull perfect shots with my eyes closed all day long. It's unreal how well Breville thought this machine through. Very happy!
972,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Love this expresso maker - had to do some research to figure out how to make expresso properly, and then when this arrived it took some experimentation to pull the perfect shot. I love this machine - it is beautiful, shiny and looks great on my counter. It feels like a quality piece, it is solid and well made and did I say beautiful! I am no expert, but it has been easy and fun to work on getting my expresso shots, and I enjoyed playing with the different features, trying different beans and making coffee for the entire family. I still need to work on the milk steamer, it is not as easy as I thought it might be - but I think my technique needs practice. This is definitely not a ""press a button for instant coffee"" machine - it takes a little practice, but it is so worth it! You won't get a better expresso - it's so nice to skip the coffee shop and stay home."
973,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Good machine so far, bit of learning to make decent cups but it's cut my morning routine from 30mins to less than 10 for 2 cups. Steam wand is ok, 30$ Mr.Coffee machine steamed easy and like a champ in comparison but eh. Good machine overall. Will update if/when I run into issues."
974,5.0,2021-04-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,This thing is so easy to use and makes great coffee but you really should watch some videos so you know how to dial in the grind size and amount to get the pressure right and how to keep the steam wand clean. I have been using it almost daily and the wife and I are delighted by the end product. We got a bunch of syrups and flavorings which I highly recommend doing.
975,5.0,2020-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"this machine is great. It does take some training and learning to get The drinks perfect. Just follow the instructions. With everyone home for COVID, we are giving it a workout and it is flawless. You do need to spend a little more money to get all the accessories and syrups. See other reviews for recommendations. There are only two shot sizes that are programmed, single and double. If you want a ristretto you either have to reprogram a button or do it manually, there is not a third program button."
976,2.0,2021-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This thing got great reviews on multiple outlets which is why I picked it for an at home espresso machine. But it’s so complicated it’s just not worth the price tag. It’s loud, the grinder gets jammed frequently throwing off the portion sizes, and it makes a mess on the counter. Whenever I’m using it the first thing I do is lay down a paper towel to catch the grinds that go everywhere. And cleaning the machine is no easy task either. Along with filters to track lifecyles it’s just overall way too complicated for a cup of coffee. You have to adjust all the settings yourself to get the right grind size and pressure. The only way to do that is through lots of trial and error. For this price I wish I had just bought a machine that gets it right with the touch of a button instead of me having to become a full time barista."
977,5.0,2021-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have a family member who is so hard to buy for within my price range. I splurged and had it shipped direct. He and his wife said it was the best Christmas gift they have received in years. Surprisingly, the male has become the barista after watching many videos on YouTube."
978,5.0,2021-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine. It was recommended to me by a man who was at the forefront of espresso tech- and it is perfect for us on our budget. Pair it with the SwitchBot technology to start the heat-up process while you are in bed!!!
979,5.0,2019-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I own a small town coffee shop and roastery - this is perfect for us. The built in grinder is why I finally decided to go with this one. It's integrated really, really well. The steamer is a little slow sometimes to get going, but given everything this does, that's a small thing. The separate tank for water was actually good for us because it lets us use local spring water instead of treated town water.

One wish is that there was a little more height under it, so I didn't have to tip taller glasses to get them under it. Small thing, really as with shorter glasses it's probably too high (splashes). If I didn't have this for work, I'd have it for home...the knock box add-on is a must, btw. The milk kettle that comes with it is perfect for the size, but I do occasionally with I could steam more."
980,5.0,2020-05-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,You will love this purchase. It makes the best coffee in minutes. So easy to use and to clean.
981,5.0,2022-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use as a first time espresso machine owner! I purchased several different syrup flavors too and will never go back to a coffee shop unless in a pinch. I bought this as a way to avoid covid interactions and I am so glad I did. The quality is outstanding, very sturdy heavy pieces. As others have mentioned don’t forget to buy espresso glasses to catch your liquid gold!"
982,5.0,2017-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have at least five different craft ways to make coffee in my house. I have Pour over... i have a peculator... i have a drip machine... i have an aero press AND i have at least three french presses of varying sizes....
NOTHING makes a cup of coffee like this. The process is easy after set up, and makes bistro quality coffee. Useful for specialty drinks, and makes a mean everyday latte.
For an all in one system... this can not be beat for the price.
Considering most cups of coffee go for about 5 bucks these days.... I would say our family definitely had this unit pay for itself in the first three months"
983,4.0,2021-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"for me it is difficult to get a great cup of coffee. I finally went to the dual strainer and it works well
Would have loved to get it to function 100%. But that is a me problem This is not out of the box product. Well it is useable out of the box, but to get the full extent of it capabilities you really need to know what you are doing. I tried and fell back to a good cup of coffee, rather then a great cup of coffee i was hoping for. But USE REALLY FRESH BEANS."
984,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Should’ve bought this sooner!!! The cost of the machine on sale is the best value/ bang for your buck!! I am a cappuccino man and can’t count how much I spent at Starbucks but ever since I added this beautiful piece of heaven to my home, haven’t been back to Starbucks and I have my cappuccino daily vs. a payday splurge or treat. If you’re in the market— take the plunge... you won’t regret it!!"
985,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love coffee and love this machine. Its so powerful! And the quality of the coffee is superb. You don't need to be a barista to prepare a cup of strong coffee with little effort. The machine almost do everything for you. Naturally, one of the important points is to look for an excellent coffee ground, like the italians, the french, etc.; you leave the rest to the powerful Breville Barista machine. I bought the machine about 3 weeks ago and up to know, the results had been excellent. Still I need more practice with texturing the milk; that requires a little bit of practice. I am enjoying a lot my machine and the coffee produced by it. I only hope it last a long time with me."
986,5.0,2018-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We purchased this Espresso machine approx 6 months ago and have used the heck out of it; daily use, sometimes multiple times a day.

Pros:
1.) Great price
2.) Effortless to use
3.) Burr grinder works wonderfully
4.) Makes fabulous espresso; great crema
5.) It has worked like a champ with great pressures and consistent shots
6.) Easy to clean
7.) Steaming milk is a breeze

Cons:
1.) We haven't encountered any serious ones

I'm not one to give a glowing accolade on a $600.00 machine unless it lives up to the hype, but this Breville Espresso maker has been money well spent for us. We've saved on those multi-weekly trips to Starbucks (which is a $10.00 average for two drinks). I estimated we spent in a year, on average $1700 in Starbucks runs. So this has already (milk, syrup and coffee beans included) has saved me close to $900!"
987,4.0,2020-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The espresso maker works well. However, the volume of water delivered is insufficient. Single and double expressos are too small! I am left with an insufficient volume of water for my coffee. I can adjust the grind fineness, grind amount, one or two servings, but, not the amount of water! This is what is missing! I like my expresso, but being able to adjust the volume of water would be great! I drink Italian and Cuban expressos and this does not meet the requirements."
988,5.0,2013-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had been eyeing the Breville BES870XL for over a year now and I finally decided to pull the trigger during the last Black Friday sale and bought one, along with a few other recommended accessories that were recommended by one of the reviewers. The machine arrived promptly and has been in use almost every day since. Our morning coffees have never tasted this good and I'm really glad we bought it. I'm still learning my ways with frothing milk and I've got some ways to go before I can come up with the beautiful flower designs you see in nice coffee shops, but everything else is as great as great as I hoped it would be. It took me a little while to operate the machine without too much of a mess, but I'm doing pretty good now."
989,5.0,2019-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this as a gift to my friend. She absolutely loves it! Easy to use and the design is sleek. Price is a bit higher but definitely worth it.
990,5.0,2017-12-07, Black Sesame,"I've now had this thing for about 8 months so time for a review.
It has performed flawlessly! No errors, no frustration, nothing but GREAT latte's!
It is easy to descale and clean.

It has paid for itself, I would have bought 5 latte's a week at Starbucks at $5 each, $25 x 32weeks =$800
I use this, between me and my teenage daughter, 4 times a day and the wife uses it for hot water for her tea.

The only appliance I have that has lasted longer is a toaster."
991,1.0,2018-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I searched for ""automatic espresso machine"" and, per the picture, that is what it LOOKS like. So I bought it.

But it is a fraud in that regard -- it looks like it must be automatic in some regard, but it is not. And I have to wonder how many people buy it thinking it will somehow make the process of making coffee easier? It doesn't make anything easier; it doesn't automate anything.

The grinder may be good. And the coffee may be good. But there is absolutely NO advantage of buying the two appliances together since they don't inter-operate to make things easier in any way whatsoever. Indeed, when you grind on the left you then have to MANUALLY move your ground beans to the right so you can expect to regularly spill dry grounds all over the place.

Consider: you would be better off if you bought a grinder SEPARATE from an espresso machine. It would be easier to keep clean. And that way one one appliance or the other could need to be replaced/repaired when one function broke.

And then there are these ding-bat lights on the machine, sort of what you might expect to see on a casino slot machine. Just another thing to break, with absolutely NO real function.

Or maybe their function is to distract you from the fact that Breville has just pulled a fast one or is apparently INCOMPETENT to make a real automatic espresso machine?

Which is it Breville? Are you incompetent to make a real automatic espresso machine?

I have no idea why the ratings on this machine are so high. Maybe some people are captivated watching the lights blink as their coffee grounds spill all over during the manual transfer step?

Anyway, I am disgusted -- and stuck with a $600 paperweight since I was travelling and couldn't return this joke of a machine within the 30 day return window. Hopefully I will save at least a few people from making a similar mistake.

And Amazon - shame on you intermixing this thing in with automatic espresso machines when it is nothing of the sort."
992,4.0,2019-08-20, Black Sesame,"My first espresso machine. We use it in the office. I feel like I am causing an earthquake each time I use it but it produces a good brew. You need to play around with it a bit each time you change coffee bean varieties. The grind affects the amount of water retained in the filter.

The one bad thing I will say about this is...why is so much water wasted in steam and drip. There is so much excess water in the water catcher even though no water is loss during the making of my cup of Americano.

Despite a negative tone, I truly like this machine. I just wished it saved valuable water. Lord knows California needs to keep every drop we have."
993,5.0,2021-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is seriously one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. Not only have I not been to Starbucks once since it arrived (thus saving thousands of dollars) the coffee I make is way better! It took me about a week to get the hang of it but now I can make cappuccinos in my sleep. My go to drinks are lattes and iced lattes but my guests love the americanos and mochas I also make. I cannot say enough good things. This machine may have changed my life. (I did get the warranty as I’ve read it can break, lots of moving pieces)."
994,4.0,2017-10-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was hoping to be able to make some delicious espresso drinks with fresh ground beans, so loved that this machine had a grinder. Too bad, I've had this machine for a couple of days and cannot get the grinder to grind. I always read and follow directions to a tee and unfortunately this machine has been a disappointment. I followed the troubleshooting guide and did the advanced clean out of the burr grinder and still, no luck. I'm only hoping that when I call their helpline, that I get good service. So, far I'm not a fan of this machine and may end up returning it. GRRRRR!

Update - Once my husband found a you-tube video on how to clean the burr grinder, (with a vacuum -who knew?!) it has worked great. The extraction is perfect for my taste and the quality has been consistently good. I would buy this again and would recommend it as well."
995,5.0,2019-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you love a good espresso drink, this is an incredible machine. My office bought one a couple of years ago, and this one replaces my decade old Breville Cafe Roma, which served me well.

The burr grinder does an excellent job, and grinds right into the filter holder. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and comes with everything you need to start making coffee shop quality espresso drinks. It also looks great in the kitchen. If you take a few minutes in the morning to make your beverage, it will pay for itself in a year by letting you skip the $4 Starbucks on your way to work."
996,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had one the same product 5 years ago, and it's so reliable. Thus, I decided to buy the same one to put in my new house~"
997,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Making some good shots of espresso now. Breville needs some better instructions or videos. YouTube has some good ones that helped a lot. The steam wand is a little weaker than I’d hoped which is why it gets 4/5 stars.
998,5.0,2021-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this espresso machine. I believe this is the best price point for a built in burr grinder. I watched a number of YouTube videos on how to dial in the espresso and learned so much about coffee along the way! Pull the trigger and get this espresso machine, you’ll save money eventually because you’ll never go to Starbucks again ;)"
999,4.0,2021-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I actually love this machine, it does take some getting used to and time and effort to dial in the coffee... but once is done, it really works great for taste...
Feels well made and does not feel like it wastes water as other machine I had (Saeco XSmall).
My only complaint is the grinder:
- Coffee grinds spill out of the grinder/filter and there is no way to avoid that - while grinding.
- Coffee grinds spill when retrieving the Filter off the grinder
- Coffee grinds stay on the Filter holder after grinding
- Coffee grinds are everywhere in the vicinity of the grinder

The above is the only reason for the 4 stars...

Be prepared for really good Coffee Shop Espressos... but be also prepared to be cleaning coffee grinds all the time..."
1000,5.0,2022-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really good for your daily cup of coffee. You can’t pull shots and use the steam wand at the same time. But it’s understandable why. Steam wand is a little weaker than expected, but I just applied more air than normal to create latte foam. It takes a few tries to adjust to your liking, but overall I really like this new addition to the house"
1001,5.0,2021-02-25, Black Sesame,"Ok it is not as user friendly as the old a Keurig BUT for the coffee lovers in my life, they love it. My daughter was reluctant to come visit because we did not have one BUT when she found out I purchased one -- she was ecstatic. My husband (his birthday gift) has learned to use it and loves it. Now what to do with all the unopened boxes of pods..."
1002,5.0,2020-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,This product exceeded my expectations! I was able to read the quick set up and have a cup of coffee within 1/2 hour of opening the package and setting it up. And what a great espresso shot! Just an awesome americano. The machine is beautiful too. I am so happy with this purchase🌺
1003,5.0,2020-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,We waffled on buying a machine for over a year. We LOVE Coffee/Espresso. I decided to finally bite the bullet with 0 other ideas of what to get my wife for her birthday. She loves it and we use it every day. The grinder is much better than our standalone mrcoffee one. The grinder is nice. The water tank is somewhat small but lasts us about a week before a refill. The portafilter is easy to clean. Watch the youtube videos for in depth info. My recommendation is positive.
1004,4.0,2017-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,There is a promotion and price mark down right after I bought it. Lame
1005,5.0,2021-01-04, Black Sesame,"Great machine. There is a tiny learning curve to get it to make the perfect espresso but once you get it, so worth it. The steam wand is great too. Cleaning is fairly easy and it looks good. Does take up about as much space as the fancy coffee pot it replaced so that worked out well."
1006,5.0,2015-12-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I did some research on espresso makers and this one hit the nail right on the head for all the things I wanted. This item grinds your beans, provides essential espresso accessories, a steam wand, and MUCH MORE that I didn’t even know I needed. It’s easy to put together, learn, and use overall. You won’t be disappointed in this product. I’m sure of it!"
1007,5.0,2019-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been longing to have this product for quite a few years. Finally grasping the great price (BlackFriday2019, $360 after a further targeted 20% off -- I guess it was the ""historical lowest""） though I chose the ""USED"" item, it was still arrived in almost mint/new condition with all parts and original package (only the box was replaced by Amazon).
Best bought item on Amazon so far, no complaint. I woke up with happy mode each morning. So pleased to kick off my every day with this Barista Express Espresso Machine!"
1008,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I had been eyeing this espresso machine for over a year before pulling the trigger on it. I love the fineness of the grind you can achieve with this machine. The extraction is beautiful with plenty of flavor and crema. This machine is highly recommended for people that want to start brewing coffee shop style coffee at home.
1009,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I got this for my husband and he can no longer live without it. We use it daily and it is amazing. Definitely took a while to figure out which grind size works with which beans to get the espresso pressure to hit the sweet spot. But after a little fiddling we now enjoy amazing coffee every day!
1010,4.0,2021-05-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a decent machine, however for the price it has its disappointments. The grinder frequently fails to allow the beans into the blades, requiring constant attention to that. Also, it is very difficult to figure out how to get the grind just right, so that the water filters through completely. It’s a lot of work to keep everything clean, and we don’t even use it all that much. For this much money, I had higher expectations than it’s delivering."
1011,5.0,2022-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I know...it’s know a real espresso machine to some pinky in the air coffeee drinkers. However it does a pretty good job once you dial it in. It takes time and practice. If you do not have the patience to research how to make espresso then pony up for an automatic machine. As it will make your life less better. However if you are in to tweaking, learning and experimenting then this is for you. You need fresh roasted beans, if you are buying at Starbucks or grocery store the do more research as they are not fresh. Grinder may not grind fine enough. Good for a built in but it should of purchased a separate high end grinder and bought the model without the grinder."
1012,5.0,2021-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,We upgraded to this machine from a smaller Delonghi. Beautiful function and finish on the Breville Express. It is easy to use and makes me look like a real barista to my family. I love the analog pressure gauge as it helps me tweak the grind and my tamp pressure for the perfect crema. This machine looks great on our counter and I really enjoy making cappuccino and Americanos each morning. The steamer heats fast and makes great foam too. I highly recommend this product.
1013,5.0,2022-08-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this for my wife, a former barista, since we live in a town without a good coffee shop these days. She has particular tastes. Like when we go into a new coffee shop, she listens to how the barista uses the steam wand before ordering a latte. She's picky like that. So with that somewhat unnecessary back story and understanding this is not a professional grade machine, she likes this a lot. She is dialing in the grind, the amounts, the pressure, the wand, etc... but we are already loving what we get from this. The water reservoir is maybe a bit small, but it solidly built and consistently good. It won't take too long for it to pay for itself in savings on crappy coffee from our town. And now friends have started referring to our house as a cafe, which may not be awesome in the long run."
1014,5.0,2020-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We haves used other espresso makers over the years, but for the price, this outdoes them all. One trick we learned is that firmly packing the grind into the portafilter is critical. To make a full filter load, grind a half load into the filter, tamp it firmly down by using a wooden kitchen mallet on the tamper. Grind a second a load and tamp that down as well. This tight packing will increase the water pressure extracting the coffee (the needle will go to the top of the gauge) for an ideal brew."
1015,5.0,2017-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Once I got the machine dialed in, the espresso was just as good as anything you can get in a high-end cafe. A few days in, I am very pleased with this machine!

If you're thinking about investing in an espresso machine, just know that it takes some skill to pull high quality espresso. If you're willing to watch a few YouTube videos and practice a bit, it'll become familiar quickly, and you'll love being able to pull shots exactly how you like them!"
1016,3.0,2021-11-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really would have wished for this product to be better. I'm a huge fan of espresso and the Breville Barista did it for me. However, after two weeks I noticed a quick turnaround in the machine. After two weeks, the steamer setting was making a loud, and I mean A LOUD, screeching sound while steaming. During this time, I also noticed a large amount of fog inside the espresso gauge. Even after descaling, the fog was still present and the sound was incredibly louder than when I first purchased the machine. I'm more than sure that this isn't normal in such an expensive machine.

My second complaint is that this machine isn't built for creating multiple espresso shots. This machine is meant more for a ""solo"" drinker, so forget having friends over for espresso! I quickly noticed that this machine was only able to make two shots within a 30 minute period, which was extremely inconvenient. When I tried making the third shot within 30 minutes, I noticed the flavor and quality of the espresso shot decreased.

Overall, it does make great espresso shots for a solo drinker, but for the price, I would have expected a more durable machine. I honestly do not feel that this machine will last longer than several months, and with the machine being so expensive with such a small lifespan, I wouldn't recommend the Breville Barista to anyone."
1017,2.0,2019-06-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's been 3 years and 1 month since we got our barista express. We clean the machine regularly and take good care of it. On average this machine sees a drink a day ~ 900 during it's life. The espresso it makes is delicious and the conical burr grinders work quite well. The steam wand leaves a lot to be desired but it's workable.

Unfortunately the machine has broken recently. The shot time is completely wrong. Manually resetting it to factory or setting to custom don't work. Machine turns on for a second then turns off. If we keep the button held down it works. Also the temperature has started to drift substantially. Sometimes up to 20 degrees cooler than the set point.

We got a lot of use out of this machine, at the time it was 500 dollars so for it to break even for us we only needed to replace 200 store bought espressos . It has done that.

But like all breville machines - it isn't built to last and it isn't built to be repaired. We'll be buying a semi pro machine for more this time. Appliances should last at least 15 years.

When we bought the machine wa"
1018,4.0,2021-08-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I like it, but my wife absolutely loves it. No more need for expensive coffee shop coffee. Running it 2-3 times a day for the past 4 months and no issues. It doesn't come with an extra filter, so that's a bummer that right away we need to order more parts. Needs to last for 2 years to be a real savings. I think it will."
1019,5.0,2021-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really love my machine right now but only after a short time of disappointing & non-stop researching. As a newbie, I couldn't get a good enough shot at first & almost gave up but finally found out the grinder was needed to be taken out for better adjustments. From then, every shot I got was around 37-38g in 25 secs with perfect pressure."
1020,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this!! It was a gift that will keep giving for years!! My family is loving all of the great drinks I am whipping up for them!
1021,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This thing is amazing. Everything we hoped for. Perfect for espresso and Americano drinkers. It makes it so easy to have espresso within seconds. A little too easy....
1022,5.0,2020-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been waiting for years to get this machine and I’m not disappointed. The burr grinder is such an improvement over my spin grinder. But the real plus is how the espresso is made just perfectly. I thought it would be difficult to get a perfect cup, but it’s not. Worth every penny."
1023,5.0,2020-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After over a year of daily use I finally feel comfortable reviewing this.

After some serious Buyer's Remorse, I quickly became spoiled by having my morning coffee from this thing. I find it grinds beans consistently well and produces quality shots every time. I like that I can adjust not only the quantity of ground coffee, but shot temperature and quantity as well.

There was a bit of a learning curve in producing quality shots. Amount of ground coffee and grind settings are particularly important, and vary from brand to brand. Some work better with a coarse setting, others work better with a finer setting. Requires tinkering to get right.

I only use filtered water in the machine, and run it though cleaning and descaling cycles once every couple of months, regardless if the cleaning light is on or not.

Quality machine, would highly recommend."
1024,5.0,2021-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If a beverage could sing, my lattes would be singing ""Hallelujah!"" Where has this machine been all my life?! It's a little messy, as far as grounds go, and uses a lot of water, but c'mon! What would YOU give for a mistake-free foaming experience for even a newbie, coupled with the ease of a machine that grinds it's own beans? I adore this machine. I'm simply hoping it lasts longer than the 1-2 years I read about in other reviews... Once you get the grind size and amount worked out (it took me a week or so, since I had to drink each one and not tear anyone's head off), it's effortless. I even use its hot water function to warm my lemon water each morning. Awesome! [No, I don't own stock in the company, but I'm considering it.] I researched this for dozens of hours before purchasing and think I made the right choice!"
1025,5.0,2020-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"WOW! I never leave reviews, but we have been so pleased with this, I had to take the time. We previously used a Jura Micro Edna 9, more than double the price. When the thermoregulator went out, they wanted to charge half the price of this Breville to fix it, so we decided to invest in a new machine instead. Our old Jura never heated them milk enough, so if you didn't drink your cappuccino in 20 minutes it was room temperature.

My husband feels like he is back in Italy and amazed at the quality of the cappuccinos I make him. A perfect cup may take a minute to make and it takes a little practice to get the milk frother down, if you have never used one. But each cup is consistently amazing and served hot and delicious. Makes even the best coffee house quality!"
1026,4.0,2014-11-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you have done your research on how to pull espresso shots, then this machine will make some great drinks for you. Don't go into this blindly just because you like coffee. Research on how/why to adjust the grind setting, time it should take to pull a shot of espresso, how to steam milk, how to maintain the machine, etc.

Again, if you've done your research, then this is a great grinder/espresso machine combo!"
1027,5.0,2020-04-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville Barista Express is honestly the best coffee making machine for the money. $600 may seem steep but I had saved my household a lot of money on artisan coffee annually. The Barista is made of a nice quality machined stainless steel which I prefer over brushed stainless because it doesn't hold finger prints. The biggest advantage it has for the money over it's competitors is the grinder built in which gives you 18 granular sizes as opposed to 5-10 on most grinders. It's an investment item for sure but it holds up well and makes great coffee. Also a plus, it makes all of those cool coffee shop sounds."
1028,5.0,2021-10-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A little expensive but makes a fantastic cup of Espresso or Flavored Coffee each and every single time.
No guess work, and so easy to use. An excellent product that I highly recommend. You will NOT be disappointed and will thank me for this review in helping you make a decision.
A very satisfied buyer.
Respectfully,
Wayne Hernandez."
1029,5.0,2021-08-06, Black Sesame,It's built like a tank. Grinder seem to work very well. It also contains the mess to the removable tray. Of course your going to have dial it in and practice. I've had a few different machines but this one I got perfect very quickly. Coffee is very hot. It also comes with many accessories that are usually optional.
1030,2.0,2021-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Updated 9/29/16 Downgraded to 2 stars because the grinder keeps clogging. It's not that hard to clean, but then when I start looking at standalone grinders it looks like there's a bunch that work well and aren't expensive. Why bother with a grinder in the same unit as the espresso maker, especially if it is going to clog frequently? It's gotten to the point where I almost hope the machine breaks so I can go ahead and get my next machine(s), which will either be superautomatic or separate grinder and automatic espresso maker. This unit is too messy and the grinder too problematic.

Original Review

Makes great espresso. Beautiful, and fairly easy to use. Once you figure out the grind size and volume for the beans you are using, pretty straightforward.

But...it's pretty messy, though cleanup is reasonably easy. Not being an espresso aficianado, next time around I will probably go to a more automatic machine that isn't as messy, and as described below, I am expecting the next time around will be within a year or two, maybe sooner, because I just don't see this machine working for years and years.

Grinder has clogged twice in 2 months - once was while using fairly oily beans, but the second time not. Cleaning the grinder is much harder than it should be, if clogging is going to happen this often. It's not impossible, but having to pull and tug on plastic and metal pieces that could easily break, having to fish out small washers, dig out both grinders, and Breville's use of a ridiculous felt ""washer"" that falls apart makes the process a pain.

I also opened the back of the machine, and when you see all the wires and other parts that crisscross in various ways it is easy to understand why these units have a dubious reliability record. I won't be surprised when something stops working as it should. I have an extended warranty, but we'll just have to see if I have to use it and how much hassle that is."
1031,5.0,2020-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee taste.
1032,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I used to work at a coffee shop for 10+ years through high school and college so I’m a bit of a coffee snob! Breville makes high quality espresso shots that defiantly taste like they came from your favorite coffee joint! I highly recommend!
1033,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it ❤
1034,5.0,2022-08-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just love this espresso machine, this is a fully functional, high performing home espresso machine. I love the stainless steel design, it looks good in my kitchen. The espresso comes out is really good! I don’t need to go Starbucks anymore. I still practice making Latte. It is not easy to make foam, you need to practice several times.

8/2/2020 update:
I just made latte art! I’m so glad that I bought this machine."
1035,5.0,2016-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Thoroughly impressed by this little machine! We had the hang of it within a day and can now make a mean espresso or cappuccino in no time. Well made, solid and easy to use."
1036,5.0,2020-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I thought my Keurig coffee was good until I tried real coffee made with this breville machine. We loved ours at home so much we bought a second one to have at my husband's business!
1037,5.0,2021-05-08, Black Sesame,This is a great machine and easy to learn how to use! The only thing I had a hard time with Waze I was burning my coffee at first or my espresso because I was packing it too hard. Just lightly pack and it’ll come out perfect dark caramely!
1038,5.0,2019-09-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For the price, it serves great espresso and has performed 100% of my expectations of a all-in-one home espresso machine. I've made as many as 30 back to back espressos shots and 38 lattes for a small party we had with no issues. Its paid for itself already."
1039,5.0,2020-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was my first endeavor into the home barrista world, and I'm very pleased. It took some time and effort to fully grasp the main variables (grind size, proper amounts, best frothing, etc.) but after some trial and error, this machine is wonderful! Works better than advertised, easy to use and clean, perfect espressos and lattes everytime. Sorry Starbucks, I'm my own maker now. 😊☕"
1040,5.0,2020-05-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It is a beautiful machine and looks great on my counter; however, I had no idea it was so complicated to use. I have yet to make a perfect cup of expresso. I have watched numerous YouTube videos and still trying to “dial in” the exact setting for the coffee beans I’m using so it doesn’t taste bitter. It is not user friendly for home use."
1041,3.0,2021-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We had an excellent Cuisinart espresso machine for 24 years (twenty-four years!) that never failed us and made great coffee. Then the incorporated grinder stopped working. We were using an external grinder for awhile, but then decided to invest in a new machine.
The Breville takes getting used to, it's extremely complicated to use. We watched a few YouTube videos to get the hang of it. It usually makes an amazing, perfect espresso with a gorgeous crema. HOWEVER we have had continuous problems with this machine over the two years we've owned it. It needs frequent cleanings and filter changes (our previous Cuisinart never needed any kind of maintenance for more than two decades!) and often makes dreadful noises and fails to produce a cup of coffee...either not letting water pass, or spitting out an endless stream of water.
The worst part is trying to contact Breville using their online form. It takes a lot of doing to fill out the form, then it doesn't go through. I found the required ""batch code"" exactly where they said it would be, it is 870, but it doesn't meet their criteria for a batch code! ""The Batch Code field must be 4 numbers and the last 2 digits cannot exceed 52. If the first 2 numbers are lower than 10, please enter the leading zero."" In short, no way to contact them online. That's why I'm updating my review and removing 2 stars."
1042,4.0,2020-05-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am writing after one day. Hard to get it adjusted to the right grind. I have tried making several cups, the pressure does not seem to be enough to empty all the water out of the chamber consistently. I have almost packed it up three times to ship it back, but will give it another couple days. Not nearly as ""automated"" as I had thought it was. Two steps to grind coffee, take the chamber out of the first side and then insert it into the brewer side. Then you push the button. Guess you have to spend $1000 to get the ""just push a button"" models! Will update review in a few days. Lots of money for a coffee maker . . ."
1043,5.0,2018-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have never spent this much $ on a coffee machine. After a few days of learning how all the dials, knobs and buttons work, I feel like it is worth the money. The trick is to find the right balance between fineness of the grind, amount of coffee, and how tightly you pack the filter cup. After some trial and error, I have now achieved consistent readings on the infusion meter, which yields a credible cup of espresso. The unit seems to be sturdy and well-designed for home use. We'll see how it holds up over time."
1044,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine, it produces excellent expresso and love the frother. You can use the pressurized baskets if you don't want to work to hard on the grind or you can really dial it in to get a perfect God shot with the single wall non pressurized baskets. I do wish that it came with an optional parnerello to make the frothing a little easier for those that don't know how to use a frother. That bieng said it just takes a little practice to learn the technique. Produces a nice dry Puck once you get the grind right. All in all I like the machine and look forward to years of service as it seems well built. Grinder produces a good fine expresso grind as well"
1045,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We invested in this machine a few months back, and honestly it is our most used appliance in our household. The pulls are so smooth, quality machine, fits our aesthetic, easy to use and clean. Overall could not recommend this machine more. XO"
1046,2.0,2022-09-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my second Breville Barista Express espresso machine. I bought this machine on January 1, 2020 and the grinder stopped working on January 27, 2021 (less than 30 days past the warranty expiration) It’s the exact same problem I had with my first unit that lasted less than 2 years. I did give this machine 2 stars because the espresso part of machine makes great espresso. Nevertheless, at $500 – $700 for an espresso machine I would expect the grinder to work for at least a couple years. Do your research online and you will find that this is a common problem with this machine and Breville knows about it. I have had various brands of machines (Saeco and Breville) over the years, always hoping both the grinder and espresso maker would last a reasonable period of time. But they don’t. My next step is to get a separate grinder and use that until the espresso maker on the Breville fails (history suggests within 2 years of purchase). After 2 of these machines, I strongly recommend you at something else."
1047,5.0,2021-08-26, Black Sesame,"I wasn’t originally going to buy this, since it is so pricey. However, I had kept my eye on it for months, and finally ordered it. Best decision. It has been great! It really does make the best shot, and the milk is like liquid silk. I have the grind size on setting 7, and it has worked for over three months.

One little tip. Before pulling a shot, press the single shot button to purge anything away. When I was putting the portafilter in, it took a little bit of might go to screw it in. The pressure was fine, but the shot was pulled in under ten seconds. When I started purging, it went in easy and the shot takes about 20 seconds. Again, it was great."
1048,5.0,2021-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,I like that this product includes the grinder and I like the quality of this device. It’s great at making espresso and capuchinos; however I wish it was easier to make coffee by the cup.
1049,5.0,2018-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I already have this in stainless but bought the black one this time. OH MY GOSH it looks like Darth Vader! I'm pretty sure it came from star killer base. Love this machine. Bought another one because mine is going into the shop and I can't live without it. Breville is paying for all the repairs on my other one. I've used it for fund raisers and church parties and take it with me on vacation. I will throw out a suitcase or a kid if I don't have room for my espresso machine.
1050,5.0,2021-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she (we) love it! Since owning it, we’ve gone from coffee shops every other day to once or twice a month. Once you get it calibrated (which is easy to do with the guide in the manual), you’ll have better espresso pulls than anything you’ll find at most local coffee shops. The milk frother takes a little work to get the hang of, but it works great too.

If you’re looking for a good entry/mid-range machine, this is definitely the way to go!"
1051,5.0,2020-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville Barista Express Espresso machine is a beautiful product to behold. It's heavy, appears well made and is a substantial appliance that should stand up to the test of time. You should have enough counter space to accommodate this appliance, perhaps show it off. For those with limited counter space, perhaps a high end built in espresso machine would be a better choice. The set up was easy and I started making cappuccinos right away. I am admittedly a novice at making cappuccinos and lattes. But I have enjoyed plenty of them. I can say that what my novice hands have managed to make so far using this machine tastes just as good as what I've purchased at the cafés. Making them consistently does take some practice. Making them look as nice with foam art will take more practice still. But it's fun trying."
1052,5.0,2022-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Since October '19, use it approximately six to seven times a day or about 1,500 times. You may need to adjust grind (both amount and fineness). Makes excellent americanos. Keep it clean, follow directions. Add Barista Coffee Knock Box, makes for quicker serving, and you can toss grounds on plants later. Will still be going to Odd Fellows Coffee House and Montana Coffee Traders with friends but for those morning jolts, this is the machine."
1053,4.0,2021-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Looks clean, easy quick set up. The double shot grinder seems to grind just a bit too much, with extra always falling out. It’s been one month, and I worried for 1 week each when the extraction gauge and steamer seemed to stop working for no apparent reason. Both work now but I’m waiting to see if it’ll happen again. Excellent frother and I love how there is a natural reminder to empty the waste bin!"
1054,5.0,2020-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,The key to success is finding the right bean and grind. Does make a difference on temperature and quality. We found Starbucks espresso bean to be the optimal choice for this machine. Be patient and learn how to use the machine
1055,2.0,2014-02-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just does not produce espresso well. I called the company and they said I was using bad beans... no problem with their machine. Not helpful at all. You grind the beans, fill the portafilter and turn it on... nothing. Maybe one tablespoon of espresso comes out. Tried all these adjustments, then it started again for no reason. Finally had to return it. The look of the machine is great... loved so much about it, except I would have enjoyed being able to make espresso as well.. right? C'mon Breville"
1056,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After we learned how to control the variables associated with making good espresso, and practiced watching customer YouTube vids this machine is super consistent and fun to use. Its well built and looks great. But i wish there was an upgrade for a bigger water tank, but small issue. Overall so glad we bought this all-in-one unit."
1057,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Hard to get adjustment right but worth every bit of the effort..‼️
1058,5.0,2016-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"High quality construction and has great look. Pulls excellent espresso shots consistently and I'm now spoiled because I make better espresso at home than most coffee shops. Customer service is one of the best that I have experienced. I've called a few times to get advice and they have been exceptionally knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. There was an odd noise start up noise that required me to send it in for service. Again, Breville customer service was super helpful. No charge to repair and returned it to me good as new. I also own a Breville Grind Control drip coffee. It makes the absolute best drip coffee. The Breville toaster that I own is also another super quality product that we enjoy at our home. I would recommend any one of the these products without hesitation.

1059,4.0,2021-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine for home use, my wife is an “ex” barista and she loves this thing! It’s a win win for me as I have my own live in Barista!
The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the grind is temperamental and when you go to pull a shot it is a weak one. Other than that it’s a thumbs up."
1060,5.0,2021-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have owned this product for about two months now and I would say this is one of the best espresso machines for home use and for this price it's an absolute steal.

Not only does it have an integrated bean hopper so you get fresh bean grind every time it also has the ""burr grinder"" which I am told are the most two important things in espresso making.

The machine is simple to use, great instruction manual is provided. For newbies like myself I would recommend check out some videos on espresso tips.

I have experienced the issue with the grinder getting stuck as well like some of the folks have mentioned but all you have to do is remove the bean hopper (beans can stay in it, don't have to dump them out) and clean up the jammed beans on the grinder, remount the bean hopper and it works again like a charm.

PS. You will need a ""Beverage & Frothing Thermometer"" if you plan on making Cappuccino and Latte's. Available on Amazon for $10"
1061,5.0,2020-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wonderful machine. Pretty simple to use. Fairly quiet, however that’s fairly objective. I was worried about the grinds getting everywhere while grinding a serving. It’s cleaner than I expected. Also, I’ve found gentle shifting the handle back and forth while the grinds are being served, really helps contain the grinds in the filter. This thing steams milk amazingly well. I’ve become spoiled with the machine and it’s quickly paying for itself. Considering a drive thru latte or cappuccino is five dollars. I was worried about having buyers remorse and surely do not."
1062,4.0,2020-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine needs attention to detail when brewing an espresso. I’ve had a tough time getting it to brew consistently. I’ve read the manual (very good by the way) and watched numerous videos but am still struggling with the pressure needle getting into the gray area. A 4 star machine otherwise but I’m thinking it’s more me than the machine. I may just have a defective machine.
1063,3.0,2019-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Primero dejo de moler, la mandamos garantía, la repararon"" , la monto y al otro día igual. La mande otra vez, llegó una nueva completamente y no levanta precion y bota el agua. Ahora a esperar otra vez. 🙄"
1064,5.0,2020-04-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I watched a video posted by e very well informed gentleman who walked through the proper use of this Breville machine. Time well spent. Read another review that was long, thorough, and very well done. Saved myself a lot of time and trouble by so doing. Takes a little practice and tamping the grind makes a big difference! Wasn't sure about how we would like the machine, but we are now hooked. Can't say enough good things about Breville. I have their bean grinder as well, and suffice it to say that Breville makes high quality equipment. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. Worth every penny."
1065,5.0,2022-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes great shots for milk based drinks (lattes, flat whites). I am not a pure espresso drinker so cannot comment there. Able to dial in various beans with the grinder. All in all, highly recommend if you want to save money buying 'proper' lattes/ flat whites/ Americanos, etc from coffee shops."
1066,5.0,2021-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"F’n AMAZING! Sorry coffee shops, but I’ll never visit again. Starbucks beans are, in my opinion, the best - so they’ve still got some of my business. There’s a bit of a learning curve, so make sure to read the manual. Only took me 4-5 adjustments and now have perfect espresso extraction. Wish I would’ve bought this years ago."
1067,1.0,2021-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this from amazon in october of 2014. First used it in Nov on 2014. We had used it several times per week, but done all recommended maintenance and cleaning. The pump has died, 2.5 years after purchasing. We can get it fixed for around $150, or purchase a new one. Found this out on the internet, since Breville customer service won't return phone calls. This is a pretty big purchase - if you proceed, get the insurance package or you'll be disappointed. Moving onto a different brand. If I spend $600 on an espresso maker, I expect it to last a few years. My $50 delonghi didn't grind the beans for me but it was still working 5 years in . . .

Edited to add:
Finally got in touch with customer service after multiple calls. They do not allow any self repair. My husband is an engineer and very good at fixing things, has confirmed the pump is broken. The only option is for me to pay to mail the espresso maker (which is quite heavy) back to them and to pay an additional $230 to repair it. Their national repair center is right down the street from me, yet they insist I am not able to take it to them - I must pay to mail it there instead. Or they say I can purchase a new one (yeah right). After some google research, I can order the part online (not from Breville) for $40 but it is backordered and not currently available.

Needless to say, we will be purchasing a new espresso maker from a different manufacturer. I would rather spend more money with a company that stands behind their product."
1068,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Update10-1-2021 Still helping me get my daily dose of caffeine !

Update 12-14-2020 Don't want to tempt fate but as with my previous update this machine is still making amazing coffee !

Update 07-21-2019
Well it has now been almost 5 years of using this Espresso machine every day and it is still working as good as the day i purchased it. With regular cleaning my Mochas are tasing wonderful and all i have replaced are the cleaning tablets and small water filters. An amazing long lasting machine which i unconditionally recommend 100% .....

I love this espresso machine its head and shoulders above the Krups machine that i use to have. Made about 200 Mochas and a little less than 100 cappuccino's and the taste just keeps getting better the more i refine my use of the machine. I would 100% recommend this to anyone who loves coffee and wants a reasonably price easy to use machine."
1069,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this last May and it has been a superstar in my house. A friend bought one and after I tried an espresso from this machine I bought my own (I’m very picky about my espresso). I use it at least once a day, on the weekends more often. I do the recommended cleaning and care, and it has surpassed my expectations. Easy to use, easy to do daily maintenance, and the espresso is amazing. We have stopped going out for coffee because the espresso we make at home with the Breville is much better than what we get in the coffee shop! Does take a little experimentation to get the settings right for the beans you will use, but the directions are very clear."
1070,5.0,2020-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We were very impressed by this machine. We purchased it for our 2nd home and didn’t want to spend a whole lot of money, but we wanted a decent machine. At our main home we have a Rancillio Sylvia, which we love. We didn’t want to go through the expense of buying a separate burr grinder in addition to the espresso maker. The machine had good reviews, had a built-in grinder and was not that expensive, so we decided to try it. We like it a lot and even kind of miss it when we’re at home."
1071,5.0,2020-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are interested in purchasing this machine to make Cuban coffee, I'm here to tell you won't be able to find anything closer to the real thing. It brews the coffee, even adding delighting foam. It is a work of art and a thing of beauty. We bought it back in December and we brew at least seven times a day. No complaints at all. If there's a draw back to it, is the cleaning procedure, but the fact that we have to clean it so ofter has to do with the tremendous usage we put it thru."
1072,5.0,2021-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my Espresso machine! It makes a great cup of Americano, and I use it daily. There is a bit of a learning curve, but I found that the most important thing to do is to get good fresh coffee beans. A great purchase, and I am completely satisfied with it."
1073,5.0,2021-03-19, Black Sesame,"After my Siemens full automatic served me for lots of years I wanted to go back to a more manual system that would give me more control over the process and give me the possibillity to make latte art. This machine does it all and I love it. Every step in the process of making cappuccino is programable/adjustable and with the pressure meter you can see instantly when you're on the spot. The steamer is powerfull enough to froth your milk in no time. I only had one incident in the first week of using it. The grinder gave a loud clunk at the end of grinding and after that I had to re-adjust the settings to a coarser setting. Than it worked fine again. I cleaned the grinder but couldn't see anything wrong.
The quality of the cappuccino is great, much better compared to that of the famous coffe chains. All in all, I love this machine although I'm a little concerned about the longevity."
1074,2.0,2021-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had this machine working every day for two years. Maybe that's how long they're supposed to last. First, it was the steam wand that stopped working well. Then the hot water. Eventually, it would stop pulling shots. I sent it for repairs, and that's when I learned Breville has a lot to do in terms of customer service.

You wait online during work hours only, and you can wait forever. They do have a system that will call you back, eventually, just need to be ready to pick up the phone in the middle of work and excuse yourself from a meeting, because no other times are available. I had to explain my address to them three times (I moved) before they finally updated my address.

They use FedEx Ground, which itself is a nightmare (arrange for a pickup, that's 8 AM to 8 PM time window unless you want to carry this thing to a store), but that's not Breville's fault.

Eventually got the machine back, ""fixed."" Tried to descale it, and it broke during the descaling. Loud noise, no water come out. I paid over $200 for this repair. Now I have to excuse myself from a meeting again to argue about a refund.

I took care of this machine - I descaled it, I used recommended cleaning materials. I always let steam out through the wand after foaming. I used to work at Starbucks for three years, I know how to make a basic latte. But this is not a fancy machine. You pay for what you get. At least I got two years out of this thing -- but I won't buy this again."
1075,5.0,2020-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Good product, nice price"
1076,5.0,2022-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had it for about a month. This is my third brand machine I've tried and so far, the best. I hope it last longer then the other brands. I paid the extra price for this simi auto because of the quality, we'll see. Time will tell. Between me and my family, it's getting used a lot; about 10 times a day. Comes with everthing you need. I've used it with dry and very oily beans, no problems. The default programs work well for me so I have no comment on programing. I've tried the different filters. They all work a little different but well. I use it 99% of the time for Cafe Americana and espresso and they come out excellent! I've tried the steamer and it works really well but again, not really my gig. The online videos are abundant and well produced."
1077,4.0,2020-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"To make good espressos, first and foremost, you need to have good grinder and excellent grind control. Without that you will not be able to achieve the right pressure and proper maceration process. The grinder on this machine is terrible. The grinder never performed out of the box. Changed beans from dark roast (oily) to medium (less oily) - results grinds slightly better. I had to use an an older external grinder. The the rest of the machine performs fine. The steamer is easy to use and clean and does a good job. Controls are intutive.

However, I will return this product due to grinder issues (may be a faulty piece but I have seen other reviews with 860XL model with same issue).

Update: Jan 2014 -
Decided not to return this product and found out that the problem was the oily beans as others have noticed. By changing the brand and cleaning the grinder, now it works fine. No issues."
1078,5.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"must have for coffee lovers!! my coffee has never tasted so good. there is a bit of a learning curve but once you get it down, it’s super easy!"
1079,5.0,2014-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Now with COVID-19, espressos from coffee shops are out of the picture. I’ve had Breville’s Barista Express for about a month now and it has exceeded all my expectations. Set up was easy, all parts came in tact, and it brews amazing quality espresso. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! This is an expensive purchase but well worth it if you’re a coffee drinker! Quarantine life has now been made a lot better with morning espressos and lattes every day. Thanks Breville and Amazon!"
1080,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Says its a basic but high quality espresso machine. Does exactly that. You do not get advanced features from the more expensive models like dual boiler, temperature control, or a touchscreen. What you do get is good espresso. You can control water amount, read the manual.

Base is relatively easy to clean, filter baskets seem quite good for OEM. Will break even one day by keeping me out of SBUX."
1081,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Divorce situation means I lost my Coffee maker! (Life can be cruel like that)
After using it EVERY DAY for three years, I took a look to see what else was out there... but wasn't impressed.
I bought it again and don't regret it!
The new unit is exactly the same except that both the Burr Grinder AND the Pressure Pump are about half the noise volume of the older unit.
It ""could"" be that the older unit was getting worn and becoming louder, OR they simply make better parts now.
Either way, I love my Breville and if I had to do it a third time... I'd buy it again.

-Happy Customer"
1082,5.0,2020-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it, good price awesome machine"
1083,5.0,2015-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Welcome to the first world. In under five minutes you will have a mug of velvety silk. All other coffee is completely awful after this. It took 11 days to perfect the ""espresso range"" pressure needed for this machine. This is what I have learned

Use the finest setting (a tick greater than one)

Grind
Even out by eye
Tamp
Grind more
Even out
Tamp
If needed repeat.
Tamp at different levels after you add more.

You will not be disappointed with this purchase."
1084,3.0,2021-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s fine. It does what it’s supposed to do. But the profit margin on this thing must be insane. Granted, this is the only espresso machine I’ve ever owned, and I bought it simply because my wife wanted it, but I just don’t get the big deal.
I guess having a milk steamer/frother is nice, but I still can’t justify the price for the value."
1085,4.0,2022-09-06, Black Sesame,"Bought this as there are fewer and fewer coffee shops around that aren't the burnt ash flavor of that mermaid logo. And I am happy to say that I am quite happy that I did. You will have to set the grind, amount and temp to your liking but once dialed in, you should be happy as well. Now my biggest issue is keeping enough coffee bean and milk in the house..."
1086,5.0,2021-10-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this machine while picking up coffee making as a quarantine hobby.
With grinder, programmable shots, and steamer, you can be a barista in your own home. The machine does everything it's advertised to do, and well! It is a pleasure to use.
Well worth the investment to make your own shots of delicious espresso, lattes, cappucinos, and more :)"
1087,5.0,2019-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my first espresso machine and I've owned it now for 2 months. I use it every single morning to make myself an iced espresso drink for my drive to work. I LOVE THIS MACHINE. It is easy to use and easy to clean (at least to wipe down after use). The grinder works great and holds enough beans for I'd say 24-30 singles. The hardest part has been learning how hard I need to tamp, but basically figured it out after the first week. All parts and components are quality, especially the portafilter...has a nice solid, heavy weight to it. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality machine to replace their morning trip to Starbucks (which was me). I'm very happy I made this purchase!"
1088,5.0,2020-02-20, Black Sesame,"Seriously, I super love this machine!!!
Yes, it does take a minute for the steam wand to wind up and it spits water but it works and I can make cappuccinos and lattes with it...
I am a serious coffee snob and my taste buds have found me a good coffee bean to go with it. I’m not paying $5-6 for a good latte at Peets as often anymore and when I have, i now even prefer my own lattes cappuccinos and americanos .
I highly recommend this machine. Love love love!"
1089,5.0,2020-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wow! I love this product. Starbucks is missing me as I haven't been back once since getting this. It did take some trial and error to figure out the settings and how to use it but once you pass that stage it's so easy and makes such great quality product. Very happy with it.
1090,5.0,2021-08-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to make cafe quality espresso and cappuccino’s. Smooth and not bitter. I had to adjust the machine just a little to add more grinds from the mfg’s settings and continue to tweak it. The Black truffle color is beautiful in my kitchen
1091,5.0,2020-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My family got this for me because I was spending a lot of money at coffee shops. I LOVE this espresso machine! It is so easy to use, easy to clean, and I am already saving money!"
1092,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Product is great when it works like most Breville products. We have had two over the years. First one broke in less than two years. The second lasted longer but it wasn’t used as often. Breville customer is some of the worst I have experienced. It makes me question continuing to buy their products.
1093,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine worked for a solid 2 weeks (perfect espresso extractions), but then every attempt to make espresso afterwards came out under extracted and sour tasting. I've used the same settings and beans, but all of a sudden, the machine's pressure gauge remained in the pre-infusion levels. For the last week, I've tried adjusting the grind size (inside and outside the machine) and the grind amount, but the espresso still comes out watery and nasty. Super frustrated with this product after having spent a good amount of money for what I thought would've been a wonderful machine. Breville customer support is also non-existent."
1094,5.0,2021-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was somewhat skeptical and leaned towards a nespresso maker but ultimately purchased Breville Barista express. Water heats up quickly and steaming wand works well. My only challenge was adjusting the grind amount and coarseness of coffee grinds. I used about a lbs of grinds, changed my technique, and made several adjustments before getting correct shot. Finally getting a solid 28 sec, 60 ml well balance shot. Don’t expect to get a great shot the first time around. Expect a steep learning curve but well worth it."
1095,5.0,2021-08-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine for two years, it is solid. Yes, it was a little complicated getting started, adjusting settings numerous times, until I got what I was looking for, then it was all good. One tip - take time with the instructions. Cleaning, read the instructions, no problem. I had one fluke moment that the grinder stopped working. I cleaned out the grinder from on top, it was fine after that."
1096,4.0,2020-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My daughter recommended this machine since I spent a lot of money on Starbucks lattes. I’ve probably saved enough at this point to make butting this machine worth it. I’m sure there are better machines on the market, for a price. I wish the espresso was hotter and pressing the coffee is a little hard if I want to get a good quality espresso."
1097,4.0,2016-03-14, Black Sesame,"the machine gives you a decent shots of expresso, and the milk frother it is nice but it is a little bit slow if you are on the go and you want your milk to get ready quickly this is not your kind of machine, this machine is nice if you want to get a decent lattes and cappuccinos at a lower price than going to the coffee shop or your local Starbucks, and paying double the price. Overall great investment if you are a coffee lover. One thing I forgot to mention a negative thing about the machine is that the stainless steel on the machine is easy to scratch and after a while of using the machine it will not be as good looking as the new one."
1098,4.0,2020-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Sometimes inconsistent with espresso.
1099,5.0,2021-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I picked this up for my boyfriend as a birthday gift (yes I know I’m the best). He loves it, uses it every morning. There was a bit of a learning curve when it came to picking beans and grinding them properly as well as picking the best time period to run the water to make the espresso but once he got the hang of it he became a home barista. Now I’m just waiting for him to learn latte art so I can at have something cute to put on Instagram."
1100,5.0,2020-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best purchase of 2020 hands down. Easy to use, space-efficient (similar to most two sided coffee makers), and a great cup of espresso. Used every morning (often multiple times) for roughly 40 days. Compared to coffee shop prices, it's already half way to paying itself off, without the waste or travel."
1101,5.0,2020-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine saved me from a $500/Starbucks habit! There IS a learning curve and once you get making great coffee, there is a new learning curve to clean it (the instructions on this are questionable - check youtube). That said, the machine makes a FANTASTIC cup of coffee, heats up quick, auto sleep mode if you forget to shut it off. It tells you when to clean what. If and when I kill this one (it gets a LOT of use) I will gladly get another one."
1102,5.0,2020-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My husband and I ordered this after graduating from a Tassimo machine, which uses pods. We were fairly inexperienced with making real espresso. I like Americanos and he likes Cappuccinos. I was hoping to find a machine which would make delicious espressos, not too difficult to use, and ideally with a built in grinder. This barista express is all those things and more. We were intimidated but overcame that quickly. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and so convenient. The espresso that comes out is rich, thick, and so flavorful. We didn't have any issues pretty much out of the box. We've been using it for a few months and it's going strong. It looks beautiful on our counter. We love this machine and would absolutely recommend it."
1103,5.0,2019-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I mean, I already had one before I bought this. I'd go to coffee bars and ask for a six-shot macchiato (a real macchiato, not that thing Starbucks makes that's not at all a macchiato) and the barista would stare at me in shock. ""Again?"" I'd be like, yeah. And he'd be all, ""That's your fourth."" And I'd just look at him with sadness and say, ""Oh Smitty, where has my life gone to?"" and he'd be, ""I'm Smitty now? Okay, you're cut off.""

Now I don't have to go through all that. I just make it at home. Yay! But still, I probably need a caffeine 12-step program. Just saying."
1104,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Its a great item
1105,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you're serious or even semi serious about making espresso, this is the machine to get. You can grind, pump shots of espresso, and texture your milk all from one device. I've been running this machine everyday for the last 15 months and still look forward to making lattes every morning. If I had one tip, it is definitely to use freshly roasted beans."
1106,5.0,2020-06-24, Black Sesame,"Update 11/22/20: over a year later and it is still going strong! Minimal maintenance, delicious espresso every time.

I had looked at this machine for months, and finally decided to pull the trigger. I really don’t want to jinx my purchase, but I love this machine so much! It makes the perfect espresso shot every time.

I do not use the milk frother, because I have a separate frother that I prefer.

I’m glad I don’t have to run out to the coffee shop first thing in the morning anymore :-)"
1107,4.0,2020-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Machine got great reviews and my brother-in-law has one that he loves. This just didn't work for our space.
1108,4.0,2021-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Smaller than expected not a lot of room to move underneath. But heavier than expected and pretty simple and user friendly.
1109,5.0,2019-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine! In Jan. 2011 I bought the earlier version of this machine. I used it to heavily (20 – 50 shots a day) for 6 years. I never had issues with it until it finally wore out last month and that was likely due to it being hit hard during a move last summer. This is a very sturdy espresso machine. The grinder is excellent and the controls let you quickly find the right amount/grind for your taste. The Bean reservoir is an improvement over the older model. In that model the beans, especially fresh oily ones, sometimes would fail to slide down the slope; this is no longer an issue with the new design.
Not only is the machine easy to use and clean, it has many advanced functions that Makes it extremely flexible."
1110,5.0,2021-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Awesome. works well so far. a big toy to play with different beens, grind settings, temperature, bean amount..etc. I have been making good Americano and Vietenease flavor coffees with it (with condensed milk).
My son likes to use it too. I tell him you can get a job at the starbucks now :)"
1111,2.0,2021-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE-APR 2015-3-4 month old replacement machine. Same problem emerges

I returned machine # 1 in Dec 2014 because it started having pressure problems and descaling did not work to alleviate the bone chilling and tooth grinding grade buzzing noise that accompanied said descaling issue.

So Jan 2015 I get replacement machine. Clean it each time it prompts as usual. Use filtered water. Was getting ready to do my quarterly descaling and the buzzing noise started again. It's loud and obnoxious and the pressure and volume of water is affected when it occurs. Went through descaling process. Nothing changed.

Tried again. Nothing changed.

3 hrs of descaling attempts. Worse now than when I started...

Will be calling Breville again tomorrow. Love this machine. Makes great coffee, but this is unacceptable and renders this great machine useless

-------------------------------

2014
The first thing I can tell you is this. When using the GRINDER for the first time. MAKE SURE YOU SET THE GRINDER TO ITS COARSEST SETTING!!! It will save you a headache. Once the grinder starts ejecting the grounds, THEN, and ONLY THEN dial it down to the 6 or five setting. Mine was making peanut butter and clogging up until I did it this way and I called Breville as their instructions said to start with a 5 setting and they told me to do it that way and it worked... Other than that, it will take minimal learning and about a 1/4 bag of coffee to get it just right. After that, you are off to the races. Espresso is fantastic and the Americano's and mocha's equally so... Hot water tap is awesome for the Americanos and for tea [I do wish the hot water adjustment had about two more degrees of adjustment]. To sum it up, I am delighted with the machine"
1112,4.0,2019-10-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a lovely machine. This is our first home machine. My husband has some barista background and I have none. Both of us find it easy to use and clean. It pulls beautiful shots and steams efficiency. This machine is pretty compact and fits on our counter with room to spare. So this is a great starter machine for home espresso enthusiasts.
1113,5.0,2022-02-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Breville the Barista Express Espresso Machine is a solidly built espresso maker you will love. No more pods, just beautiful espresso to make any kind of drink you like. Auto grinder works well. The only part in the process to master is the tamping of the grounds in order to reach the brew pressure level. Just keeping playing with it until you nail it. I even had a problem of losing the filter piece (cats knocked it into the garbage) that holds the grounds. Breville let me purchase a new one and provided free shipping. Most importantly is the quickness of the espresso, make a cup in under 90 seconds."
1114,5.0,2021-02-26, Black Sesame,"Let's be clear, this is not a professional coffee shop machine. However, with a built in grinder, steam wand and its compact size, this is a great home espresso machine. It takes a little fine tuning when you get it. Once you have the grinding adjustments made, you will not be disappointed."
1115,3.0,2017-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s clear the machine functions well. I’ve had it for over a month and it makes wonderful coffee, but I’m VERY disappointed that Breville has opted to use cheap stainless steel for this product, as it has ALREADY STARTED TO RUST. I clean it and dry it after each use so this should jot be an issue. I went to look for options to replace it, hoping this might be a fluke issue, and the return/exchange window has already closed. Very disappointed in the quality of a product that is priced this high. Three stars because it still functions well."
1116,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is my second unit. First one was great. This has major leak after a month. Not impressed for $700
1117,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Its a great product for those that love coffee, super simple to use. Things to note, programming the grind amount will help you keep the area clean otherwise you get coffee grounds everywhere. Its a bit loud when grinding and brewing something to keep in mind for early morning brewing."
1118,5.0,2021-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have owned for only a month now but so far, love it.
There is a little bit of a learning curve to get things dialed in, as other reviewers note, but I don't think I am as obsessive about getting 'the perfect espresso' as others may be.
What I like is that it packs it all into a smaller chassis and so far, works as advertised."
1119,5.0,2020-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you’re thinking about getting this machine, you can stop. I’ll do the thinking for you, “You must get this espresso machine.” Sounds better if you hear it in a zombie-like voice, but I digress.

To say that this is easy to use would be an understatement. From the time you open the box to the moment you plug it in, setup is a complete breeze. Everything you need to make an outstanding cup of espresso (minus the beans, water, and the cups of course) is inside! You have so many options to be able to customize your brew the options are nearly endless.

In all seriousness, if you’re thinking of getting this.. just go for it!"
1120,5.0,2020-05-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have had the 870XL for 7 weeks and use it everyday. All the functions work, but the quality of the drink is up to the operator, so practice makes perfect. It took me about a week to really produce a first rate cappuccino. The machine itself works well with good materials, fit and finish. Is it versatile, well its an expresso machine with a bean grinder and milk steamer; it does its stated functions well, but I wouldn't say it is versatile. It does exactly what it is advertised to do and that's good enough. Since I only had it for 6 weeks I can't really comment on its durability. Silly question to ask for a new machine."
1121,4.0,2017-04-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had my device for almost a week now. I’ve used his machine before and purchased it because I loved how it operated. The setup, however, was probably the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do with an electronic. The manual and quick step guide did not explain everything thoroughly and I almost thought I was going to have to call customer support because the item was broken. After searching through numerous YouTube videos to answer my unanswered questions, I began using my espresso machine. After some practice, I am finally in love with my coffee! This machine is wonderful so far but better instruction should have been provided or people may think that what they receive is defective."
1122,2.0,2020-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I loved this machine! It made delicious espresso shots every morning. Sadly, it stopped working after one month. One day the grinder made a loud noise and would not produce any ground coffee. I meticulously followed all cleaning and maintenance. It just simply stopped working. Unfortunately I had to return it."
1123,5.0,2019-11-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is awesome. I’ve never had a problem with it. It can grind the coffee beans at any fineness that I want. I like to use the double dose non pressurized filter. I would recommend that you try watching some YouTube videos for pointers on how to dial it in.
1124,5.0,2021-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased December 18th 2016 so I've had it now for 1 year and a month. I love my Breville as it has really saved me alot of money! I make my lattes every day...so much better than Starbucks lol. Just this past week I began to have problems with the machine everything has gone wonky and is no longer working quite right I was pretty upset as I have owned it just over a year and the warranty is only for one year so I called Breville customer support number on the back of the instruction manual and they were so helpful no questions asked they're sending me a prepaid box to send it to be repaired and Upon returning it to me I'm promised an additional 6 month warranty on the work!!! Great buy Breville 100% backs their products!
1125,5.0,2017-06-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"YoHo...... I finally found a winner! After reading a lot of reviews of espresso makers, I first tried the De'longhi EC155, tried 2 and both didn't work, then I spent $500 to get a Breville BES840XL infuser, tried everything can possible help to make a perfect shot, even contacted Breville tech support and spent another $200 to buy a Breville smart grinder, buy new coffee beans change baskets, still no luck. then I return both machine and grinder and bought this combo machine. It makes the perfect shot at its first run. Just follow the instruction set the grind setting, you will get a honey brown crema espresso. Normally I am not the kind of person will write reviews on the first day receiving a product, but I am so happy finally find the perfect espresso machine, can't wait to share. I spent less money and get a perfect match grinder and espresso maker. This is a great deal!"
1126,5.0,2020-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine, got it as a gift. It lasted a long time but broke down because we didn't clean it as diligently as needed. Was able to fix it for awhile, but we ended up buying a replacement. The current version of this model seems to have a few improvements on the internals. Always remove the coffee from the pod when your done drawing the shot. Lets the machine air out and limits any bacteria growth."
1127,4.0,2021-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very hard to dial in and if/ when you change beans...back to square 1. I think it works great if you have the time to play with it. Good luck
1128,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Once you get the hang of this you'll really appreciate it. Love the Hoper & grinder on it. Also there are plenty of Youtube videos out there to help you along the way.
1129,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Expensive, but I tried the less expensive brands and there is no comparison. This will make an espresso with a beautiful topping of crema"
1130,5.0,2020-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really like this machine, I have used it every day for two years and it is still working like new. The espresso is delicious, foaming (soy) milk is a snap, and crema is easy to achieve. The cleaning is easy; about every 3 months you run some vinegar/water through and use one of those cafeza tablets (there are bulk ones for cheap). I use filtered water (grocery store, .49/gallon) to avoid calcification on the internal parts since I have well water otherwise. Highly recommended!"
1131,5.0,2020-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product if you are willing to shell out this much cash for expresso. It grinds accurately enough that rarely have to trim the dose. Easy to clean and delivers consistent pressure. There are tons of videos on this machine for operational tips. Only downside is now visitors come and stare at it until I ask “would you like an expresso?” .. be ready.
1132,5.0,2021-11-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,The machine is easy to use and easy to clean. We still are perfecting the perfect settings for a single and double shot however we are really enjoying it. My husband is making lots of latte's and they are tasting fabulous. The type of milk you use is key so we are learning something new every time we use the machine. I can't say enough good things about it. If you are looking for an espresso machine I think you found it. My husband did a ton of research and this machine was at the top of everyone's list. Enjoy!
1133,5.0,2020-04-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very happy with the item. Have to use the double walled to get to pressure regardless of grind settings but it works and hasn't given us any guff.
1134,5.0,2021-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Loving this AMAZING espresso machine! I’ve waited so long and did a lot of research for a machine in this price range and I am beyond happy with this one!! Had an easy time getting the calibration pressure correct. Like super easy!! Cleaning it is a breeze And it looks beautiful on my coffee bar!
1135,5.0,2021-11-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine. We looked at other machines for a while and decided on this one due to the reviews on here, and the features. This does require some fine tuning so be prepared to go though a few cups to get things just right. After a couple mornings we had ours dialed in and have been very pleased. Cleanup is straight forward. The only slight negative we’ve experienced is the filter getting stuck in the machine when removing the portafilter. This has only recently started as the filter and portafilter have “broken in” a bit and don’t fit as snug."
1136,5.0,2019-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I picked this machine based on Americas Test Kitchen review as best espresso machine under $1000. Definitely worth it. Ive been spending money on Nespresso pods and have never been fully satisfied (although they do make a quick decent espresso without any effort). Howver, this is the real deal at a reasonable price. Simple to set up, simple quick start guide and not much else to know. Best part is I can choose what beans I want to make a shot of espresso with. Very happy with this purchase."
1137,5.0,2017-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine; it takes a little more time to figure out just what settings you want for what espresso but when you do this you get hipster coffee house quality espresso, lattes and cappuccino. All of the components of the machine look and feel high quality, they have packaged it will all of the accessories you will need. The espresso bean hopper is a good size, the removable water tank is also a good capacity, and easy to remove once you get the hang of it. You can grind your own beans or use already ground espresso. They've really thought of everything. When you have a machine like this, you realize you don't need to pay a fortune at Starbuck's, and that maybe it never tasted that good anyway!"
1138,5.0,2021-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Took a few iterations to adjust to our coffee beans and desires but had operating within an hour or two. Making great latte's and making Americano style too. Hot water feature good for HOT chocolate and even tea. Steam wand works great to with its shape and temperature allowing smooth frothy cream.
1139,5.0,2021-11-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,I recommend it. Good quality and easy to use it
1140,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine is beautiful! With fineness , dose settings and the pressure gauge it makes it easy to find the sweet spot for your espresso and be able to repeat it. I would regularly visit coffee shops but now find I can make them just how I like it at home for a fraction of the cost. I know I have already made up the cost of this machine between my wifes coffees and my own and to have your favorite coffee first thin gin the morning without leaving the house is priceless."
1141,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is an incredible little machine I should have bought this years ago!! Being able to make any coffee drink easily without leaving the house is the best. Easy to use, easy to clean it is well designed they thought of everything with this one and it looks great in my kitchen."
1142,5.0,2019-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Such a great machine. Very sturdy and love all the hidden self storage for all the tools etc.
1143,5.0,2021-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had our Barista Express over a year and are really pleased. Not a fully automatic machine but easy enough to use and it makes great coffee. I played with the settings and tried different coffee beans. It took awhile to get it right but it is certainly worth the effort.
I think I'll go make another cup."
1144,5.0,2018-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After 3 full months of use making at least 2 drinks per day, I can honestly give this machine a full 5 stars with confidence. The machine itself is beautiful and well constructed. Plenty of real stainless steel, this thing is durable. Setup is easy and not intimidating with easy to follow instructions with photos. Once you have the machine tuned in, you'll be making coffee shop quality beverages in no time. Steep price tag is definitely worth the higher quality compared to similar products. Cleaning cycle is also very easy to do and doesn't take a lot of time. If you're serious about your commitment to staying out of the coffee house and saving money by making your own drinks at home, this machine will not disappoint and you will find that making your own becomes your new daily habit."
1145,4.0,2019-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great for the home barista who knows what they're doing, but can be challenging for newbies to espresso-based drinks. Finding the right settings can take time and waste a lot of beans.

Grinder can be tough to find the right grind size, I have mine on the lowest setting (without manual adjustment to the burrs). Steaming milk can be a little slow."
1146,4.0,2021-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very good machine but it was starting leaking after first couple of cups when used a steamer. Thanks Amazon to help me exchange it!
1147,1.0,2020-10-14, Brushed Stainless Steel," The high water pressure system on our Breville system failed within six months, essentially making it a glorified coffee grinder. My wife has pulled out the old Mr. coffee machine machine to make a cup of Joe. At a10th of the price we should have just stuck with that.

My wife is registered a support ticket with Brevelle but as of the time of this review we have not received any feedback from them on what can be done to remediate the issue. Not holding confidence that we’re gonna get anywhere."
1148,2.0,2020-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this product based on a recommendation. I wish I had read all the negatives first. It is an impressive looking piece of kitchen equipment but it does not function well. 1st off the steam temperature gauge NEVER left the warming up mode resulting in poor quality crema and tepid espresso. I tried various grinds for the beans but to no avail. Adjusted the machine as per suggestions in the Trouble Shooting Section of the manual - that didn't work either. I called the manufacturer for help, they told me I was ""probably using oily beans"" and to switch beans. Hello.... ""espresso beans"" are oily beans!!! I tried cleaning the grinder and using other beans which did not resolve the problem either. 2nd - the machine NEVER produced a ""puck"" when finished, it always produced soupy wet grounds making the machine difficult and messy to clean. I called the manufacturer again - they said it ""sounded like a faulty machine"" and that I ""should return it"". Which I did. I purchased a new (Italian made) machine and it works like a gem.
Incidentally, the family member who recommended the Breville machine to me has since begun having problems with theirs. Thankfully, they purchased an extended warranty. DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE!"
1149,5.0,2020-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I think it's convenient, in the fact that I can make gourmet espresso and cappuccino at my house. It has forever changed my mornings."
1150,5.0,2019-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So glad I splurged and bought this. I'm still learning all the features of the machine, but it also provides the grace to make a good cup of espresso or a latte while you're learning more about the manual features."
1151,5.0,2016-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this one based on the reviews I've read and it was worth it. If you are not familiar with these machines you definitely need to read all the instructions. I've had cheaper machines which I thought made good espresso, not so much compared to this machine. You will need to adjust the grinding levels a couple times to get it set perfectly, however, it's pretty easy to do. The steamer steams the milk perfectly. It's easy to clean and looks great on your counter. For beginners, just be sure to follow the instructions and you will end up with a great latte or cappuccino. Would definitely recommend. Worth every dollar."
1152,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,my major complaint is you have to fill the water tank way more than i would have thought and draining the catch at the bottom. Just didnt know this was how it worked.
1153,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a very sophisticated and dependable machine. I’ve had a number of other brands of Espresso makers in the past, and will keep coming back to Breville. This one replaced a Breville espresso maker that I had for 12 years and 3 moves. The pump finally gave out. I got my money’s worth."
1154,5.0,2021-07-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fantastic espresso machine. Highly recommend!
1155,5.0,2021-07-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this espresso machine! I did my research before buying it and the reviews for this brand was like the best ones! Is easy to use, i will recommend if you don’t know a lot about making espresso shots ask a barista or youtube! But its pretty easy tbh. Honestly I haven’t regret spending my money on this machine! Since my first latte it honestly paid off!😊❤️"
1156,5.0,2020-10-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am a huge fan of Breville products. They may cost a little more than others on the market, but I have never been disappointed. This machine is no exception to that. I would classify it as fantastic, and well worth the money. The instructions are easy to follow, and the learning curve was very short. While it does take an extra couple of minutes to steam the milk for a latte, I have not had a cup of regular coffee in the morning since it arrived. After just a couple of cups, I felt as though I had owned it for years. Clean up is super easy, and it is attractive on the counter. The output is of Barista quality. I love the automatic grind for one or two cups. The steamer is super fast to heat up, and the brewing gauge let's me know if I need to make adjustments. I couldn't be happier with this purchase."
1157,5.0,2017-09-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As advertised and good quality. Making the cup of coffee you want takes some time to learn but the adjustments on the machine allow for a lot of tweaking. After several months, and a lot of learning, I use this machine everyday for my wife and I and occasional guests and it was a good balance of quality and price for our house. You will need a few accessories to go with it but I am very satisfied with this purchase."
1158,5.0,2020-07-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Loving this machine. Had been using Saeco machines made for and sold at Starbuck's and this Breville is a game changer. I found it very, very easy to quickly dial in the perfect espresso. Ease in setting grind adjustment and the pressure gauge makes this a quick process. The water chamber does deplete quickly...but it is very easy to fill. I measured cabinet height prior to purchase and unfortunately came up just short...but this wasn't enough of a hindrance to not buy. But you want to check that. Also, I use an oily french roast bean and the grinder has worked perfectly...no jams or issues of any sort. The unit is built very well...solid and heavy. The portafilter seems commercial grade."
1159,3.0,2020-07-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I already have the smaller breville machine.. it is just like this one, minus the grinder. I was expecting this machine to produce an even better espresso shot. Not really..it is just the same but the grinder is included. There is a major design flaw..is the tamper is in the wrong place, it should definitely be on the other side of the machine. It is always awkward filling the protafilter at the grinder and having to cross over to get the tamper tamp and put it back. It is assbackwards. This only cost an additional 75 dollars .. so I guess that is the price of the grinder. Anyway..was just expecting a wow factor..and now I'm just irritated overtime I grind my beans that the tamper is misplaced. Buyers remorse... I sort of wished I used my $500 to purchase a different machine with a better design."
1160,4.0,2020-11-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have some issue making the pressure gauge go high... It's very complicated to work with, there's no good videos online to specify the best way to use it and everyone has a different way of using it, so it's very hard to decide what is the best way to use it. If anything the machine is beautiful and maybe when I get the best way to use it, I would be more satisfy."
1161,5.0,2021-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this coffee machine. I bought one 12 years ago and I loved it. It is still working, though I use it several times a day, every day. I love my new machine equally. It makes great coffee, it is easy to use. The ordering part was equally easy; the machine came faster than promised, even during the pandemic. I strongly recommend it."
1162,5.0,2019-03-28, Black Sesame,"11 years experience as a barista and coffee connoisseur. This home espresso machine is great! Easy to use, and clean. Be sure to test it with grind level and tamp weight to ensure the machine pulls good shots. Be sure to purge the steam wand after EVERY use and clean the portafilter head thoroughly. Treat your equipment well and it’ll do the same for you! :)"
1163,5.0,2021-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best thing ever! Coffee shop espresso drinks at home! Easy to use and clean and powerful blending/grinding.
1164,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine! Once we got it adjusted - it is hands down the best latte my husband and I have ever had. It was pricey but well worth it since we were going through one of those cheap espresso machines every 12 months. It is so nice to have a machine at home that grinds the coffee right before you make the latte. Before we had to grind once a week and by the end of the week the coffee was dry and less flavorful. However, you will use more coffee beans with this machine as there is a lot of waste when grinding. Also, try to place it near the sink since you will be frequently filling the water tank in the back with your sink spray nozzle. If you want a smooth delicious latte (or espresso or Americano) and are tired of spending $12 a day buying them then this is the machine for you."
1165,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was my best purchase of 2020, it's been fantastic. The only thing I wish it had was a dosing ring so that ground coffee didn't get everywhere and a notification when it's out of water. But both of those are minimal issues in my mind."
1166,5.0,2021-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"ok soooo this machine is not user friendly. you really have to love coffee and have the paitents on brewing good espresso. If you were a former barista this is perfect for you. I love love this machine ive made better espresso then Starbucks, dutchbros, and any other coffee place. I've gotten a lot of praise over my lattes and it has a lot to do with this machine. Mind you I use to work as a barista for 4 years. This is the best machine for home use. Its an investment, so think of it that way."
1167,5.0,2019-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is amazing! Espresso is SO MUCH BETTER than drip coffee ☕️
I didn’t know a thing about espresso machines (besides how amazing macchiatos are at Starbucks!) and I got the hang of it in one day. Took 10 minutes to set up and read the manual. Started pouring shots and by the 9th or 10th shot it was perfect 👌🏻 Great tasting!! Easy to use!!! LOVE that the grinder is built in!!! That’s a huge plus!
I gave it to my Husband for his birthday and he said “this is the BEST adult present 🎁 !”
Huge hit at the party and everyone (20 plus) was impressed!!!
Worth every dollar!!!!!!"
1168,5.0,2016-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"WOW! This marvelous machine has taken my enjoyment of coffee (Americano) and espresso to the next level. I never thought I could make espresso that tasted like that I got in restaurants, but with this machine it's easy."
1169,5.0,2021-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The person that suggested buying the syrups, towels, and cleaning products are correct. it is important to clean this machine throughly every-time so that it will last a long time. I have had zero problems with mine so far. I absolutely love that I can enjoy a coffee house style latte every morning now a a fraction of the price. My favorite coffee to use is Starbucks blonde roast with some vanilla syrup and cinnamon."
1170,5.0,2020-09-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve been wanting this for a long time - I’ve been using a Nespresso machine but I felt bad about using all those individual capsules (even if they can be recycled, it feels wasteful. Using whole beans not only provides for better coffee but also comes out cheaper on the long run (plus environmentally friendlier). It takes a little effort to figure out the grinding fine-ness and quantity, but once you find your optimal setup and coffee beans, you’ll have consistent high quality drinks."
1171,5.0,2020-04-22, Black Sesame,"I'd tried the small Italian espresso maker; no creme! So I sprang for the Barista Express. A little more than I'd hoped to pay for a descent espresso machine, but after reading many reviews I thought I'd give it a go. So far, so good. Nice creme (which is important) and fairly simple to use. I haven't tried the frothing feature yet, just not a big latte guy. I like my coffee and espresso BLACK!"
1172,4.0,2021-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine is awesome for beginners. It comes with everything you need, just buy coffee beans. I can make better coffee than Starbucks with this. Don't buy a fully automatic one touch espresso maker, they can't make high quality coffee and break down often. I tried Jura, Krups and Nespresso super automatic and they all fall short. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's grinder is not awesome, it's good enough but not mind blowing. But for $699, it's a very good combo machine.

It does have a slight learning curve but if you want good coffee you need to make it manually and not rely fully on machines (maybe some day)"
1173,1.0,2021-04-08, Black Sesame,"I got this as a mother's day gift and for the first couple of weeks it wad going great. I followed the cleaning instructions and brewing, all was great, but then these last few weeks it's not a doing good.
I have read the book over and over but the pressure won't move.
I add more ground coffee, not pressure movement. So then I added less, still no movement.
Changed the grind size, still the pressure won't move and it's no longer tasting good.
It's a bummer for how much my husband spent for it to give out in just a few weeks."
1174,5.0,2021-06-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,We are delighted with our purchase of the Breville. It took us a few times to figure out the right setting to fill a single or double shot. I can make a latte that tastes just as good from a Starbucks.
1175,5.0,2017-07-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Received it yesterday and unpacked. Wished there was less styrofoam in the packaging. The product instructions were terrible copies of some original. Printed a better copy from the internet. The setup was easy but clearly 24 hours into using this, clearly there is some subtle programming I have to learn about setting water temperature and amount of grinds. But coffee is the best cappuccino I’ve made and I’ve been making cappuccino for 30 years usually with a Delonghi. Made about 8 cups already for guests with rave reviews. Will pay for itself in a couple of months instead of going to coffee shops."
1176,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I pray at this altar to espresso at least two times daily.

The coffee gods have been kind."
1177,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Works great have used mine everyday since beginning of December. Easy to clean great for making Lattes before work instead of stopping at the coffee shop. So far it has held up to the abuse of daily use and making coffee anywhere from 2-3 times a day.
1178,5.0,2021-09-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this for my employees. They love the ease and quality of the espresso that this machine provides. I received many thanks for purchasing this machine.
1179,5.0,2020-11-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine. It makes great espresso but there is definitely a learning curve. Make sure you get fresh roasted beans or it won’t taste as good. Also I bought a coffee tamp and distributer because it helps save you a headache. Overall it’s a great machine and I highly recommend.
1180,1.0,2019-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Phenomenal machine until it died 6 months after purchase. The hot water and steam function stopped working. I contacted Breville and setup a time for them to call me back to trouble shoot the issue. They never called. They sent an e-mail to say sorry, they got tied up and rescheduled the call for the next day. They never called again. I sent two more e-mails with no response. I tried multiple times to submit my service request at the Breville customer service website, but the website is failing to submit my request. I have attempted to contact Breville via phone multiple times over the last two days, but there is a recording that states their service reps are unavailable due to training and will be available again within the hour. They're never available. Bottom line...works perfect until it fails. One year warranty, but Breville customer service is terrible. --- UPDATE --- Still working with customer service to get my machine fixed. Numerous phone calls, hours on hold and no replies to e-mails. I was able to make contact a week and a half ago and the representative was helpful and asked me to descale the machine. It didn't work...I knew it wouldn't. Although his e-mail said, ""let me know how it goes""...he never replied to me again after I provided the feedback and asked for shipping instructions to get the machine repaired. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED. GOOD LUCK!"
1181,4.0,2019-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine is great. We love it, but they dropped the price $150 since I bought it on 4/1/20, while everyone was in quarantine, and coffee shops were closed. Therefore, they price gouged the f@ck out of people. Which is illegal. Real nice."
1182,5.0,2020-09-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! Watch all the YouTube videos and do your due diligence but I would recommend it. I love coffee and this machine makes coffee that takes like a coffee shop .... My friend has one and I loved the cup she made me:)
1183,5.0,2019-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Tastes great and fairly easy to use after reading directions really well.
1184,5.0,2017-05-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Like you i sat there and thought this was a lot to spend on yet another gadget for kitchen, but truth is that this is great money spent, the quality is really second to none, I have bought 3 things in last 5 years I love, a Shun knife for $600, a simply human garbabe can for $300, and a dyson vaccum for a ton of cash, the point is not ONCE did I ever regret spending the money, quality pays for itself time and time again. I just had a crappy day, made myself a latte with this baby and was sitting here thinking what a great buy, so I thought i would write a review to hopefully convince you to do yourself the same favour, I promise you too will have a moment like this.

Cheers"
1185,4.0,2019-10-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Coming from a former barista- I LOVE this machine and it saves me money because I buy one to two coffees a day easily. However, it’s not always consistent. Normally the first double shot I pull is good, but if I pull any after they are normally not good shots. (I normally do 3 to 4 shots of espresso. I normally drink iced 20 to 26 size drinks). It just unfortunate, but still a good machine overall. It produces high quality shots as if I’m going to a regular coffee shop."
1186,5.0,2019-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine! I actually bought it for my husband for Christmas and thought he'd kill me because of the price. It is worth every penny. Just like getting your favorite cup at your favorite café. Easy to use and clean. Fun to try different beans and designs. Would definitely buy it again. Will definitely save us money in the long run because we now make our own at home.
1187,4.0,2021-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"(edit)
- contacted the support and they gave me link to buy the ring for 2.99
thanks

Gasket is probably the most annoying this here,

its suppose to be 2.99$ for the 54mm silicone ring but since breville don't sell it anymore you have to buy it way overpriced......grinder is mostly only for this machine.. i would invest on a good grinder and buy other espresso machine.

if you are a beginner, i guess this machine will do

but if you are experienced barista and a coffee head i would definitely look for other options, this machine wont give you an optimal extraction."
1188,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this as a birthday gift for my father who couldn’t quite pull the trigger on ordering it for himself. He received it about a month ago and still calls multiple times a week to tell me that it’s everything his coffee was missing. Very pleased with the purchase and his coffee happiness :)
1189,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use , great machine!!!"
1190,5.0,2020-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing!
Bye Starbucks. All you need is to find you perfect coffee match and you are done. Great machine. I love everything about it. Easy to use, clean and doesn’t take up too much space."
1191,5.0,2016-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've only used this machine twice so far, but on the default settings it provided an exceptional latte experience out of the box. Amazing crema, easy to froth, easy to use, perfect coffee dosing, and the machine is positively beautiful. I've owned 3 other espresso machines over the past 20 years, and this machine blows all of them out of the water. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely."
1192,5.0,2018-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine after becoming very frustrated with my local coffee shop's drink quality. What once felt like a treat was no longer! Although I have had other machines before (Starbuck's Barista and Krups), this machine was surprisingly sophisticated. It did require some practice to get the shot quality just right, but the gauge on the front and a very helpful user guide made this pretty self explanatory. The machine is beautiful and the size ideal for my countertop.

After four months, I am a very satisfied customer. I've had no issues that couldn't be solved by reading the handy trouble-shooting guide. I highly recommend this machine for the novice barista is you are willing to invest in practice and a little sleuthing to make a perfect cappuccino! I looked at many machines and read many reviews before buying, and in the end, this was definitely the right choice for me."
1193,5.0,2019-11-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The size is perfect for most counter tops. It looks impressive on your counter top. Whatever you do, read the instruction manual completely and I advise watching some videos online which explain the machine very well before attempting to use it. I had another espresso machine prior to this one, but this one is so much better and more complex than any other that I wouldn't advise just attempting to use it if you haven't used this type before. The coffee is super and the foaming is the best. Hope you like it as much as I do."
1194,5.0,2014-03-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine for over a year now, and it is still going strong. This was one of my best purchases of 2019, and it has become a lifesaver during this pandemic. It offers the balance between a professional espresso machine, and a reasonable cost.

Purchased: Aug 2019
Update: Still recommend April 2021"
1195,5.0,2019-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"You have to follow the instructions, or you will not be able to enjoy the machine.
I ended up using the double wall filters in order to get the correct pressure, as using the single-wall filters and pressing as much as I could using the finest grind setting, I could not get the pressure needed.
Once we figured that out, we have been enjoying a nice espresso every day. We use it a minimum of 4 times per day."
1196,5.0,2021-08-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,So easy to use! We love it. It’s easy and espresso is always great.
1197,4.0,2021-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes great espresso, my only complaint is the knob to turn on the steam is difficult to turn, especially for arthritic hands."
1198,5.0,2021-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is SO easy to use, delicious coffee and makes Starbucks quality.
I bought this for my husband for Christmas as a surprise and he uses it daily as do I!!
Mochas, Lattes, Macchiatos, Americanos you name it they are delicious with this machine.
Special thanks for the reviewer that did a VERY detailed review of what accessors to get, expect etc! He was on point!
SO thankful I found this machine and very happy with my purchase!"
1199,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is our 3rd try at finding a coffee machine that works for us. Tried a saeco and gaggia both significantly more expensive. The gaggia only lasted a year and the cost of sending it back under warrantee that might not have been a warrantee issue made it impractical. So we went with the cheaper Breville machine, while not as convenient, the taste and ability to tweak the machine to perfection makes this a winner for us."
1200,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 I love this. I splurged and for this for myself. Shipped to ALASKA, no issues. Took me a minute to figure out but the top reviews on this are awesome and there are great YouTube videos too. I love it. Makes me happy."
1201,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this for work. It took a little bit to put it together and to understand all of the controls. But I will tell you it makes a wonderful cup of expresso. I have a hard time drinking espresso anyplace else now.
1202,5.0,2020-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine. Any error has been user error. Still fine tuning the grind but it still makes a great shot of espresso. Would recommend. Also would recommend watching YouTube videos on it to help dial it in.
1203,5.0,2020-09-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s very expensive but so worth it, makes the smoothest espresso just get good beans like lavazza or petes. My aunt has had hers for the past 10 years and it looks and make espresso like it’s brand new!"
1204,5.0,2021-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this machine in 2014, used many times per day. Worked amazingly for over 5 years. It finally cried for help about three weeks ago. I called Breville. They sent all the necessary packaging, including freight charges. It was simple. Their repair shop would give it the once over, make the repairs, and send it back for a flat fixed rate of $238.00. If it was deemed non-repairable, they’d send a new machine. Guess what? R.I.P. to the old machine. True to their word, a new machine arrived last week. Now that’s how you run a great business."
1205,5.0,2020-04-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had the pleasure of using this machine at a prior job, and I’ve wanted one since, but they never go on sale. When I found it on Amazon on sale, I didn’t hesitate.

I followed the instructions to set up and flush the machine, and made my first espresso. This will pay for itself, by eliminating my trips for coffee. I got rid of my regular coffee pot, because I won’t need it. I believe the key will be to find the right coffee beans, then the possibilities are endless. I’m having a love affair that will last for years, and I’m so excited to finally have this machine. It’s worth every penny!"
1206,4.0,2021-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is an awesome espresso maker but not great on longevity. Got a little less than 2 years out of the last one. Bought the exact same one since I love it so much. Let's see if this one does any better in life expectancy. Seems like 2 yrs is average for this machine from a lot of reviews I've read.
1207,5.0,2021-02-09, Black Sesame,I love this machine! So much power at such an affordable price!
1208,5.0,2020-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is no free lunch if you want reliably great espresso. Fresh grind, controlled brewing temperature and time, and a pressure gauge to determine if your grind size, volume and compression are correct. This Barista does it all and does it well... for a price that seems very reasonable given the quality of the machinery, and bottom line, the product it produces."
1209,5.0,2020-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,
1210,5.0,2021-02-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes awesome espresso and love the product. Very happy customer!
1211,5.0,2021-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I upgraded from a Gaggia Classic. My friends have a Breville and I loved the creamy, smooth espresso it made. It tastes so much better than even my local coffee shops. I feel like I am in Italy again. The instructions were easy, and the trouble shooting card was super helpful. I have the bean grind dialed in, and everything else. No mess after use, grinder built in so doesn't take up too much counter space. I am saving a ton in cappuccinos at the coffee shop and they taste better!"
1212,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Thermocoil - heating element - failed after three years of daily use and always keeping up on maintenance/cleaning. Called Breville customer service and they said I could pay $300 to have it serviced (I originally paid $450) or I could buy another one new.... No thanks.

Bought the new thermocoil assembly for $50 and replaced it myself, which was a massive pain in the ass and not intuitive at all. Still didn't work. Waste of time and money.

If you're looking for a solid, daily use home espresso machine that you can service yourself, LOOK ESLEWHERE."
1213,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Finally a great cup of expresso at home.Easy to use, just let it warm up for about 10-15 minuyes and then just follow directions."
1214,5.0,2019-11-22, Black Sesame,"I am very happy with this machine. I can order my favorite bean from Seattle (Vivace) and make my own lattes each morning with oat milk. This machine has been terrific - highly recommend. Granted, I haven’t used any other similar machines so can’t compare."
1215,5.0,2019-03-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best espresso machine I have owned no more trips to Starbucks i think this actually saved us so much money 🥰
1216,5.0,2020-05-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best purchase of my life.

You have to wait a little bit before you make your next espresso to give the machine a little time to breathe. Like less than 5 min or else it might not be at espresso range"
1217,1.0,2017-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Now, I should first acknowledge that my husband and I may have been too incompetent to figure the machine out, OR that we got a lemon. These are both possible. But after a month of daily experiments, we gave up and sent it back.

The water quantity for our espresso ""shots"" varied in size from 1.5 oz to 4 oz. Same grind (finest), same tamp. We tried 3 sets of beans. That was with the ""dual wall"" filter basket which is supposed to be for rookies. (Which I admit we were.)

It consistently underexpressed (I think)--crappy crema, too quickly poured shot, bitter--except that it took the right amount of time to start pouring but poured for too little time. Again, this was with the grind set to finest, (although we knocked it up to coursest too, just for giggles) and with me tamping with as much weight as I could drop on the thing.

The result was varying quantities of bitter tasting espresso (anywhere from 1.5 to 4 oz.)

Now, if this had been Costco, where I can take things back after a year of fiddling, we might have exchanged it, tried again and kept at it. But I didn't want to risk that I was just too dumb to figure out the dosing (maybe it's too fine, or too undertamped, or too little! Take a guess!) and get stuck with a $500 machine that pours undrinkable swill.

Oh, and good luck trying to reach Breville customer service. The link to the help page on their website turns up ""page not found.""

Fortunately, Amazon will take the product back in 30 days. So it went back at 29 days.

On the up side, it's super easy to clean and the milk frother worked great."
1218,5.0,2020-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a great product. I'm picky about my coffee and was spending way too much to get coffee every morning so I got this and after I learned how to use it (about 8-10 cups later) I got it down. I have a wonder espresso drink every morning at home!
1219,5.0,2020-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this Breville Espresso maker for my husbands birthday a month ago. His Gaggia Baby was failing and it was the perfect time to look for a better option. My husband is 100% Italian and is an avid espresso drinker. He makes his a triple every single day. This machine is great. So easy to use and it makes a great shot of espresso. You can change the amount of shot you draw. The grind is perfect straight out of the box. I must add that the best creama comes from really good beans. My brother in law roasts his own beans so you will have to find a good bean in your area. This is a top notch machine for the money. So happy with the purchase.
1220,5.0,2017-04-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Well made, attractive, does the job, easy to use, good value. If you're like me, once you lock in how you want use a product, you stay with it. Why pay more for digital features that will cost more to fix when they break?"
1221,5.0,2020-08-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. Makes a great cup of espresso. This machine may come ready to go for you, I had to do some adjusting to get the grind right ,so I could get the pressure I needed for the extraction cycle. All that said, machine adjusted the Barista Express gets wonderful crema extraction and makes a really nice micro foam. And brings together a real nice latte or straight espresso."
1222,5.0,2020-05-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My husband and I love using this machine - it is so easy to use. I really like the gauge on the front that tells me if something is wrong (blocked) so I don't break the machine or put too much pressure on it. It also makes it easier to dial in the pressure needed for each type of espresso since each one is different.

The grinder is surprisingly great. I only bought the one with the hopper because at the time it was cheaper than the one without. I am sooo glad we have it. It grinds just enough (you can adjust it for different espressos) for single or double shot."
1223,5.0,2020-12-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So this is my first espresso machine and I love it! It’s easy to use, easy to clean, and makes amazing shots and froths milk very well! I buy locally roasted FRESH beans and have to recalibrate the grind settings often but I don’t mind because there’s not much to it. When I extract a shot and make a latte it is hands down the best latte I have had! We’ve been using this machine everyday for 4 months. I’ll let you know if something goes wrong.

UPDATE: I have had this machine for a year now and still love it!"
1224,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought an open box, and it was in great condition. Some minor scratches, but unnoticeable. The product itself is great, easy to use, just press a single button and go. And cleaning is easy too, there is a mechanical hatch at the bottom that once it comes up, you manually remove the tray. And depending on your beans and pressure, it becomes an amazing quality"
1225,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really wanted to give this more stars. Makes great espresso coffee, but I’ve already had issues with the bean grinder not working properly. At least 4 times, and counting, I’ve had to take apart the grinder to try and find out why it’s not producing any coffee grinds. I’ve only had this machine for a month and I feel the grinder is useless at this point. Very upsetting given the price of this machine. I do not have time every other morning to try and disassemble parts to make the machine work properly."
1226,5.0,2021-08-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It probably took me almost a month to master this machine but once I did, I wouldn't trade it for anything else! The coffee I was using in my old machine tasted horrible from the Breville so I switched coffee and played around with the grind size and amount used and now it's just perfect! Same with frothing milk. It didn't take as long to get the hang of it and now it's spot on every time. Definitely worth the money - just give yourself some time to get used to it."
1227,5.0,2021-08-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This thing is amazing. It basically gives me coffee-shop quality lattes in the comfort of my own home.

The grinder works well, the steam wand produces perfect microfoam, and the shots are consistent and delicious. The only part I don't like is emptying and cleaning the tray (a necessary evil), as well as the grounds that stay on the head (maybe I'm doing something wrong, there).

But, this is a splendid machine that will pay for itself in about two months. (Assuming two lattes a day, at an average value of $5, with the price of beans at $14 a bag for about 20 lattes worth. Not very scientific, but the point is that it completely replaces coffeeshops, for me.)

I'm off to learn how to create latte art! Until next time..."
1228,5.0,2021-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’m very happy with this espresso machine. It takes a little practice but it is easy to make great tasting lattes once you have it down. My only complaint is that the coffee grounds do not fall into the center of the portafilter causing quite a mess and loss of grounds each time.
1229,5.0,2017-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,The price is the only thing that held us back on getting this. $500+ for something to make coffee? What the heck. We splurged and treated ourselves and couldn't be happier. This espresso machine is very nice. It looks great and makes very good espresso/cappuccinos. Now it's basically just trying to perfect the best combination of coffee and milk. I'd definitely buy this unit again and highly recommend it.
1230,5.0,2016-09-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolutely love this system. I've been Nespresso user for several years, but finally decided to get back to a ""real"" espresso machine. And this is a perfect all-in-one system. Easy to set up and use daily, and it looks great in the kitchen."
1231,2.0,2017-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It is really too bad that I have to give this item a negative review. This machine makes a great cup of espresso. Here is what I like about this machine:

1. It makes great espresso
2. The pressure gauge gives you a way to quantitatively tune how fine to grind the beans, and for how long.
3. You can make a new espresso very soon after completing the previous one.
4. The hot water spout is great for making an americano
5. The tamper is decent quality and attaches magnetically to the machine. I just left it there and tamped the grounds by pressing the portafilter up on it
6. The integral grinder is convenient. It is of decent quality, but for me it was a mixed blessing. More on this later.

What I did not like so much:

1. Though the steam wand works OK, it takes a long time to texturize milk: > 1 minute in my experience.

2. Out of the box the grinder did not work. I could hear the gears spinning, but no coffee from in the portafilter. After doing an `advanced cleaning, which involves removing the grinding elements, the grinder worked for about a week. After another advanced cleaning it would grind rice, but not coffee. Because of this issue, I returned the machine.

My recommendation: If you are considering buying this machine, you might consider buying the version without the grinder, and buy a good separate burr grinder."
1232,3.0,2020-01-30, Black Sesame,"Why 2 stars? Performance, support, and complexity.
In order to operate the machine you need to learn by yourself from good Samaritans that place youtube movies. One part came defective - there is practically no service: they do not respond to their online form, you wait endless time when calling them, they promise to send you the part but never came.
The coffee taste OK - similar to the automated Saeco machine we had - but, here, with so much more work.

Added a start once the filter arrived ."
1233,5.0,2019-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love coffeee! This machine is easy to use and is a great espresso maker. The steam helps to make great lattes and cappuccinos. It’s easy to clean. I actually have never used the grinder on top but I plan on so that I can get the most potent coffee.

Btw, This is my second one. I still The have the first one which I gifted to my brother bc he really needed one. So I got myself another ; ). It’s been over a year where I had my first one and made at least 2 lattes daily. Still going strong!"
1234,5.0,2021-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Once you know how to use them, it works fine. But it takes some time to know the different filters and when to use them. It's not as user friendly as La Marzocco, but given the price range, it's acceptable"
1235,5.0,2021-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We had been enjoying great coffee several times a day for almost 6 months. But after experiencing the horrific earthquake on November 30th 2018, this machine was not producing the superb coffee we had been used to. We tried reprograming what we could, but the automatic water supply shut-off would not correct itself and the coffee was bitter. We pulled the plug and let the machine sit overnight. That trick was enough to reset the machine. Everything works perfectly again and our coffee is wonderfully smooth. It is easy to operate, has very clear directions and produces wonderful coffee. We highly recommend this machine!"
1236,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is fantastic. Easy to use - great coffee - and really pretty sitting on the kitchen counter. Would recommend to anyone who is wanting to get into the Cappuccino game and not wanting to spend a small fortune on a machine that would be difficult to operate. I use Almond Mike and my family uses whole Milk - either way, great foam and taste.
This is the one..."
1237,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a top of the line, very advanced little machine with all the powers of a professional Barista machinery. Don't be confused by the size, this little masterpiece packs a great punch, with simplicity and elegance. No need to ever go to starbucks or any other coffee shop ever, at you fingertips in the convenience of your home. We've had other units but this is by far superior and more technological than other peer machines... buy in a heartbeat, three of my friends have acquired the same unit... you wont go wrong !"
1238,5.0,2016-09-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this for our office and all of the coworkers LOVE it! It's exactly what we needed and it's so easy to use. The aroma of fresh ground coffee not only fills the kitchen but also lingers making it smell delightful. We joke around that we're Starbucks next competition and who knows, we might just be! There are multiple settings on how fine you'd like the coffee to be grind, and the options of making it a single or double shot. After grinding and having the espresso drip, to the right there is a station for adding hot water to your beverage and a steamer if you'd like to add steam milk. The whole machine is fairly easy to clean. There is a light signaling of when it needs to be cleaned, however, the drip tray needs to be emptied periodically. It's so simple, that even some of our coworkers are thinking about purchasing one for their families!"
1239,5.0,2021-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,It took a little time to get everything perfect - got the grind fine enough and I found out that 18-19 grams of beans was the right amount - I brew in that espresso range every time!! SO GOOD and so much fun. Saving lots of money here.
1240,5.0,2021-05-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is by far the best thing I have ever bought for myself.. and if it broke today I would 100% buy it again. Once you get the hang of the settings (grind size and amount) it’s super easy!
1241,5.0,2021-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this in Oct 16. Worked really well, we made two lattes every day, sometimes more. We use daily it A LOT. Feb of '17 I started have
I got some issue with it. Breville was fantastic. The service was very good, they took my machine back, worked on it and sent it back. When I got it back, it worked, but not as good as it had before. When I called and told them that they sentence me a new machine. Make sure you clean your machine!! Or you'll have the issues I had. I cleaned it, but not enough. I love the sooty espresso it makes and the steamer is great! Not just a glorified coffee machine. Thank you Breville!!"

1243,2.0,2021-07-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Read the booklet, unboxed and minimal assembly/prep. Started grinding fresh beans in factory setting ‘5’. First espresso like the next 10 or so never saw the pressure needle move once. Flow start times varied. Extraction time always short. Attempted 1cup and 2cup single wall initially then 1cup dual wall. Best combination to move the needle on the pressure gauge a little…set grinder on finest setting, tamp the 2cup dual wall, use the razor, then add a little more and retamp likely above 40lbs, then finally…the needle moved a little. Flow started after 10secs, extraction time less than 20secs. I haven’t even attempted steam wand yet…what a mess already, 8.8oz can of illy beans wasted…ugh, I need a coffee! 90% sure this will be returned for a different company/model. $700 should do better…"
1244,5.0,2021-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I adore this machine, perfect lattes every time - no need to run out to a coffee shop when you can make them at home"
1245,5.0,2021-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I truly believe in ""you get what you pay for."" and for the price you pay it holds up in quality. I've had it for a little under a year and there has been zero problems, and it creates excellent crema. I'm very interested in coffee so for me, buying this espresso machine was kind of nerve wracking being the fact I had standards I wanted it to live up to. and it didn't disappoint"
1246,5.0,2021-05-11, Black Sesame,"This machine is awesome. I was looking for anew machine that grinds coffee beans and I have 2 choices in mind. Delonghi Magnifica XS and this one the Breville Barista Express BES870XL. It's was worth the research I did for this machine. The great price and the bonus items that come with it worth every penny! Thanks to the people who take the time to make those reviews, they are very helpful. I read some reviews about the Delonghi Magnifica XS that grinder some times gets stuck and is very difficult to clean. With the Barista Express you can easily clean the grinder and is removable.
If you are looking for a good machine and easy to use, this is the right choice."
1247,5.0,2020-11-09, Brushed Stainless Steel, I am so thrilled my son talked me into spoiling myself. Helped so much to add the sliding tray. Now I need bigger mugs!
1248,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excelente product. Love it.

AMASON DRIVERS DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND LEAVE PACKAGES IN DIFFERENT HOUSES. Then, CUSTOMER SUPPORT DOESNT FO AMYTHING AGAINST IT AND YOU JUST EASTE YOIR MONEY. BE CAREFULL"
1249,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My 16 year old daughter set it up and was using it right away. It is not hard to use at all. I was nervous about it after reading some of the reviews, that is would be too complicated. It is not at all complicated. This machine rivals a professional grade machine. This machine will save us money in the long run, so long as we don’t wear it out!"
1250,5.0,2020-10-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very easy to use comes with a great manual on how to pull the perfect shot! Watching the needle hit the espresso range brought so much joy on my first cup! So upset that I didn’t buy this sooner!
1251,3.0,2016-03-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Honestly, the steamer on this is really weak. May want to have a capresso foamer."
1252,5.0,2017-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is so much fun having this machine. Once I figured out why the beans didn't flow through the grinder, it has worked great. Also, the online and telephone support was very good

December 2015: Three years later. This machine is still working perfectly. It is part of our family. From an engineering standpoint, really well made; I can't believe something hasn't broken, but not the case

June 2017: My machine finally died. I bought a new one instead of sending it in to be fixed because Breville wanted $250 to fix the leak. I figured it would be a better investment to just buy anew one. Also, an electrical problem with the pump surfaced. I bought the 4 year extended warranty, we'll see how that works out.

April 2022: our machine is still working perfectly after five years! Changing my review to five stars"
1253,3.0,2019-10-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a knockoff (or inspiration?) for this Italian machine: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QMWZ6PT?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

That DeLonghi has a built-in dampener, automatic water level check, and it can make coffee as well as espresso. I love it. But it doesn't have extra port. cups. I upgraded to the DeLonghi bc the Breville arrived with a broken pump."
1254,5.0,2018-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had to send back the first due to a leak from the bottom, but after the replacement it works like it should. Occasionally the grinder doesn't have anything to grind due to the reliance on gravity to feed the beans into the grinder, but it's easy to open the lid and shake some beans down [while its OFF!] For what it's worth, there's no warning to check the water reservoir either. Easy to clean if kept clean. Great machine."
1255,4.0,2021-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pros - Easy to use
Cons - Expensive and I wish the water was hotter."
1256,5.0,2021-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am obsessed with this beautiful little power house espresso machine. So amazing and makes the best espresso, lattes and coffee. Very easy to use. I can't believe I haven't had one before. The best money I have spent this year."
1257,5.0,2019-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really have enjoyed the Barista Express. Grind and water are very precise which show in the espresso. My only complaint is that if one is the least bit careless in placing a cup or shot glass, the result is a scratch or dent to the top front of the tray. I should know! Anyway, I retrofitted a strip of gray hypalon that is a good match with the non-metalic cup warmer on top. The front is protected and now, it's perfect!!"
1258,5.0,2021-06-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this BES870XL for almost 2 years. It provided me nice espresso every week until 3 weeks ago the grinder lost strength to crash the beans. I contacted the customer service online and got immediate response asking me the product details such as the serial number. And the next day a prepaid FedEx label was sent to me by email and days later packing materials were delivered for returning the machine back to repair. One week later, the repaired machine came back to me with a full check list of diagnostics including temperature, pressure, etc. besides the working grinder. The whole process is smooth and easy."
1259,5.0,2020-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"You will have to do some minor settings adjustments to get your espresso just right. Depending on the bean you use. Easy enough though. My wife and I each ordered a Starbucks every morning, spending around $12 a day. Well bye bye Starbuck! It's only been 21 days and we have saved $252 on Starbucks. We rwsd some reviews about the machine breaking too soon, so we just bought the 4 year warrenty too, for the peace of mind. Get yours and you'll save if you are a Starbucks junky too!"
1260,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is all I need.
Espresso.
Sleep? No. Espresso.
Machine works magnificently, I replaced a lower end machine and didn't realize just how much better the dark energy boosting drink could get.
The only thing I'd recommend is a frothing thermometer if you're not experienced with frothing milk, otherwise this thing comes with everything you need!"
1261,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Loved the taste of fresh ground beans and hot foamy cream. It is work to develope just right settings but go up a grade of Breville and it is automatic and great.
1262,5.0,2020-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been buying and using in home cappuccino machines for over 15 years. Each time I buy a new one I like it better than the last. I like the style of this Breville, it looks nice on my counter. Having the grinder and machine together makes things more compact.
The instructions are very detailed and clear. There are many different options for adjusting the grind and the water.
There is a pressure gauge in the front which indicates when you have it right. I found by putting half the necessary grounds in at a time and tamping after each half I could get the pressure right."
1263,5.0,2017-03-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As a professional brista, I am weary of home espresso machines; most times they lack the amount of pressure needed to make decent foam. I am blown away by how fast this machine starts up, within a few minutes it is ready to dispense hot water for tea, or pull a shot. When comparing machines, the biggest concern I had was the ability to steam milk consistently and expediently. I have to say, the Breville 870 has enough pressure and temp regularity to make rich foam in a matter of a few minutes. I would highly recommend this machine based on the high quality craftsmanship, excelent customer service at Brevile and of course for the quality of lattes it produces!"
1264,4.0,2020-06-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update: This machine is still going strong after being used everyday for the first two years. Now we use it a few times a week as I cut back on my coffee habit.

I have had my Breville for 24 hours. I was able to get it setup and making espresso in the “zone” within three attempts.

My one complaint is that it takes a bit for the steam wand to work. I am still trying to figure out how to make good foam.

Overall, I am happy at this point."
1265,5.0,2019-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been using this machine for the past six months. It has saved me a ton of money. I used to drink a Latte twice a week and I was not a huge coffee drinker. Now I wake up looking forward to my morning ritual. It has been the best gift to myself and fortunately or unfortunately I have become a coffee snob, my latte tastes better than 99% of coffee shops that I have gone to and I am not an expert by any means. Some good espresso beans and you will be making the best lattes that you have had.
I was debating between this one and the dual boiler and Oracle. However, I like the built-in grinder."
1266,5.0,2021-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the machine that takes you from amateur to expert. I highly suggest you watch the many video's on YouTube for hints and settings. you will waste 5+ shots of espresso to dial in the settings. You will NOT use this machine if anyone is sleeping near by. Beware if you get it and expect it to blow you away out of the box this is not the product you want. If you want 'next level' quality this is EXACTLY what you want if you learn the machine! Great Quality
1267,5.0,2022-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Takes a little time to get use to and make sure to everything right. But I love this and so happy i got it. Only thing is, the temp gauge doesn’t always seem to work. Still figuring it all out, but I’m pretty sure even if the grinds are too compact or loose the temp gauge should still show movement. It is now all sudden back to working after a few weeks it not showing much movement; at the start it worked great too even. Minor problem even after cleaning. But if it happens again I’m definitely getting it looked at to make sure nothing more is wrong or if it can just be fixed."
1268,4.0,2021-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Overall I am happy with this machine, but 3 issues seem to sort of put a damper on that for me.
1) When pulling shots it often starts to pulse in pressure when my husband makes his. I have worked with him to make sure he is doing it right but it is annoying when it starts doing that and a total waste of beans.
2) I also wish the grinder would deliver the grind more to the center of the basket instead of the back so there would be less spillage.
3) The steam wand will be going good and all of a sudden stop. After a few moments it will finally start to put out steam again. Very annoying when aiming for a perfect foam head."
1269,5.0,2021-09-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you follow the setup directions it is very easy to produce excellent espresso, lattes, etc. Particularly love the commercial grade steam wand. I moved up from a $200 machine to this $800 (on sale for $525 on Amazon). The difference in quality of coffee is night and day. Now have lots of friends dropping by for 'visits' on Sunday mornings with coffee mugs in hand!! :)"
1270,3.0,2017-08-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After using the Breville Barista Express Espresso just a month, its coffee grinder got clogged. We cleaned it and a week later it clogged again. Since the unit itself is somewhat heavy, cleaning the grinder will require some effort to turn it over with the grinder feeder facing down, which can cause a huge mess and inconvenience. I am not sure if the effort is worth the cup it makes! Nonetheless, we decide to get a replacement for the benefit of the doubt that the 1st one is a lemon. Although the unit comes with a user's guide, it is not easy to follow. Imho, nowadays nobody wants to read manuals but rather, the manufacturer should provide easy-to-follow Youtube videos on all matters of assembly, operation, and cleaning but they don't."
1271,4.0,2020-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes truly excellent shots. Crema for days. Steam is slightly underpowered but still makes silky, frothy milk if you take your time.

Would definitely recommend.

Beware, you might find yourself drinking a *lot* more coffee."
1272,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this espresso machine as a surprise for my husband, as we both enjoy the morning kick start that espresso provides! It was one of the BEST investments I have ever made!! It is incredibly easy to operate and to clean! It also looks very sleek and is a small footprint so it does not take over our kitchen countertops! We have been using it everyday since we received it (about 2 months now) and have had no problems or complaints thus far! The steamer wand is incredibly easy to clean, and I have had to do the more detailed cleaning (as I was prompted to do so by the ""clean me"" light). This was also very easy! I am VERY pleased with this little bundle of joy and recommend it to all lovers of a good cup o joe!!! You will not be disappointed!!! :)"
1273,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have had this machine for a couple of years and use it almost daily. This is the first and only espresso machine I have owned. I almost didn't buy it due to some negative reviews about it not getting up enough pressure to get into the espresso range on the machine. In my experience if you follow the directions it will get into the correct range and make a great cup of espresso every time. I think the people have problems are experimenting with different grinds and settings. My only complaint is the machine is a little messy but I think this is to be expected. We have ours sitting by a bar sink making clean up easy.
1274,5.0,2013-10-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First, the machine I received from Amazon was nonfunctional out of the box. I was disappointed but called the Breville company and they sent me a brand new one without any delay or hassle. I highly recommend this machine. It is well made and makes delicious coffee. Hopefully, you will not get a bad one at first like me, but know that Breville is a great customer friendly company that will make it right."
1275,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso maker has made two double shot of espresso every day for two and a half years now and still works like new. We have never had an issue with it to date.

The most important thing for good espresso is grinding good beans fresh. This one allows you to grind one shot worth and keeps the rest of the beans sealed and fresh. we love this one because you can adjust the grind size and grind quantity very easily."
1276,4.0,2020-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I worked in coffee shops all through high school and college. This machine is pretty easy to work! My sole complaint would be the steaming wand- it’s not great. It does work, just not very well."
1277,5.0,2021-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am very pleased with this unit. I am a coffee snob and had 3 coffee machines on my counter top prior to this purchase. All the others are gone now. The only down side to using this is that sometimes the coffee is not piping hot. It is hot just not as hot as some units. Easy to use, quick clean up, and very good coffee."
1278,4.0,2019-08-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine however to be fair I've only owned it 1 day. I'm still trying to work on my barista skills to get the perfect puck to achieve correct pressure. I love the espresso so far that its produced. Machine is a little noisy of course but sturdy. I purchased this due to excellent reviews and a co-worker has had the exact same model for 2 yrs. Her husband is a espresso connoisseur and raves about this machine. I thin we will be very happy together :)
1279,2.0,2021-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this coffee machine fews months ago, and it starts to malfunction frequently. It will suddenly turn off when grinding or steaming. Sometime, it will not even response that I have to restart couple times. For a product that only been purchased for 4months, situation like these should not be exited. If the malfunction does not exit, it is actually a good coffee machine."
1280,5.0,2020-10-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"You can customize your coffee you will experience the barista concept but its very high end coffee
But you have to be patience the first time"
1281,5.0,2017-07-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my expresso maker, so does everyone who I ever made coffee for. It makes great expressos, lattes and cappuccinos. Takes some time to get things right, grind size, grind amount to generate right amount of pressure, etc. Only problem I have with it is almost every time after I clean it, it takes a few brews to get it's pressure back. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or it's a normal thing but it can be annoying when you are trying to make a good cup of coffee and for some reason it doesn't generate any pressure. But as I said earlier, otherwise it makes almost perfect cup of coffee for me. No Starbucks can compete with my cup of coffee."
1282,5.0,2015-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was a barista before college and love a good cup of coffee. This espresso machine makes wonderful americanos/lattes and espressos! It took a minute to get the grind size right but it’s so easy to use and I think I was actually making it more complicated. I just cleaned it and once again was surprised by how easy it was. Very smart machine, I hope it lasts forever:)"
1283,5.0,2019-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love the ability to get my coffee at home. Takes a few tries to get it tamped properly. My advice. Don’t over think it. Does not take as much pressure as some make you think. The steamer is the best I have used for home. Love this.
1284,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great espresso maker. A bit complex for a beginner, but now that I know how to use it and have refined the process for my taste preferences the process of making a drink is quick and easy. Cleaning is generally pretty easy, but there are many parts to clean with each use."
1285,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine, haven’t had a single issue. Surprisingly powerful for its size."
1286,5.0,2019-09-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Took quite a few espressos and lattes before I got it right! Well worth the trial and error period. I did purchase a calibrated tamper to eliminate guessing the right tamp pressure. Get the right beans👍
1287,5.0,2019-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Well made and versatile! Fast startup, ready to go in about a minute. Has the ability to adjust all the settings to give you the results you prefer. You can adjust grind, quantities, liquid outputs, etc., either manually or by adjusting the automatic outputs to your preference. Exactly what I wanted: a quality machine without having to spend +$1K and over to get quality output. Water tank is removable so easy to keep clean and uncontaminated. I can't speak to its durability yet since I've only had a couple weeks, but seems solidly made. Thumbs up!"
1288,3.0,2021-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine worked really well in the beginning. No issues with it at all. We made at least one cup of espresso a day sometimes more than one. We really liked this machine. It was easy to use. Push the buttons and go. Frothing the milk was not hard at all.

Now here we are less than two years from purchase and the pump no longer works. It is going to cost more to get the pump fixed than what the machine is worth. For something this expensive you would think it would last longer. We are shopping another machine now and we are seeing the same reviews over and over. A year or so in and the machine no longer works.

Either all these machines are made in China (which is why they stop working) or these companies are playing games to manipulate the public to buy more machines. I think a machine should work longer than two years."
1289,5.0,2015-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best investment ever I love this product it’s very easy to use and extremely easy to clean I am so happy with this product packaging was great and shipping was fast
1290,5.0,2018-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wish I would have bought this years ago to replace my Keurig. The coffee from the Keurig started to taste the same no matter what flavor I purchased. Every time I would travel outside the country I would realize what lousy coffee I was drinking back home. I am not one to go to coffee shops to get my fix. I need coffee as soon as I wake up and this Breville Barista Express is everything I could have hoped for in a machine. Easy to learn the set up, great coffee and easy to maintain. From start to finish about 5 minutes making a latte (espresso, steaming milk and cleaning the unit). Highly recommend the expense."
1291,5.0,2021-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'd been using a cheap coffee maker for the past few months and began to wonder if I'd just gone off coffee as I wasn't enjoying it. This was delivered a few days ago and I'm back to being a coffee addict. Some really cool features, like the pop up ""clean me"" message when the tray gets too full. I was a bit surprised at first how little coffee I needed to get a decent cup - I'd been using twice that previously. The steam wand is great as it can swivel back to the tray so I can get lazy and leave the milk to froth while I multitask. Love love love it!"
1292,5.0,2017-03-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"just love it. makes really good espresso. easy to use and easy to clean. I just wish it had a bigger cup to make bigger shots, we like very strong coffee and we have to fill up the cup to make coffee 2 times."
1293,5.0,2013-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville Barista Express is a truly excellent machine. I’m getting excellent espresso and espresso beverages from it. It’s partially manual operation is part of its charm, as you’re involved in the process. For best results, it’s important to use the correct filter baskets, and to preheat the machine as described in the instructions. I’d gladly buy the machine again."
1294,5.0,2021-07-15, Black Sesame,This is my third one. Two for me in two locations and another for a friend.
1295,5.0,2020-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent machine for the price. I have noticed a few annoying experiences such as the steam pressure can be a bit inconsistent, depending on the amount of water in the chamber I think.The pressure gauges are nice but there isn't much you can do to correct the situation if the espresso isn't adequately pressurizing which just ends up making you feel a bit frustrated and helpless. Also there is a hot water shutoff, presumably for safety but you have to turn it off and wait a couple seconds for it to produce hot water again. Lastly, the grind amount setting is not sensitive enough, I frequently have a lot of overflow set at the 25% setting."
1296,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this about 6 months ago and initially found making the adjustments tricky and tedious, but in fact after some messing about with grind fineness, amount of the coffee, and some other adjustable parameters, this machine works very well....good crema, could wish the production to be a bit hotter, but the steamer wand works very well. So far no problems, it was a good buy, especially if you get it during a discount! Beats my last coffee machine all to hell!"
1297,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Upon setting up the machine, it was not working properly as not enough pressure was being generated and the espresso was diluted as a result. Customer service was excellent in identifying the issue, which was that the coffee beans being used were too old, so the dual cup needed to be used instead of the single cup. I only wish this had a glass water reservoir instead of a plastic one as I don't like to have water sitting in plastic for a long time, in case any chemicals could leach out."
1298,5.0,2020-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine has turned me into a bonafide coffee snob. While it took some time to tweak all of the essential dimensions (water temp, grind size, coffee amount, draw time, basket type, etc.), I now make the most delectable coffee on earth because of this gorgeous contraption. It's the first thing I think about when my eyes open in the morning. I've ditched all of the other coffee-making paraphernalia in my kitchen (french press, grinders, baskets, pour-over devices, and others . . .) because they pale (literally) in comparison to the gold that comes out of this happy faucet. If my apartment goes up in flames and I have to escape quickly down the fire escape, my espresso machine is coming with me."
1299,5.0,2019-05-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was so happy to get a good product at a low price even though it was sold at a very high price in Korea. The coffee tastes great, too."
1300,5.0,2021-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it! Easy to use and clean and it not just one of those “cheap” ones. It actually works almost like a commercial one. It doesn’t have the steam in the steam wand tho.. but I’d say it’s definitely worth the money!🤩
1301,5.0,2020-02-14, Black Sesame,We have used this machine and it has paid for itself 100x over.
1302,4.0,2021-06-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,5 stars Except that in order for it to perform that five star level you must buy a different tamper. We purchased a LuxHaus 53mm Calibrated Espresso Tamper From Amazon. It made all the difference! Consistent tamping is the key to the quality of the end product.
1303,5.0,2019-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine in december 2017 and it made delicious espresso nearly daily until june 2019, at which point i stopped getting pressure from the machine. breville customer service was *so* *helpful.* i had to wait a while to be connected, but once i was, i reached customer service in america (california) which was a pleasant surprise. they then walked me through troubleshooting options for about 30min. the problem was not fixable, so they are sending a replacement. can't honestly ask for more than that! would absolutely buy from them again."
1304,5.0,2020-10-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought barista last Black Friday and I was so satisfied. It makes the best coffee I’ve ever had. It might look a little bit big and confusing but it’s very easy to use and makes coffee in no time. It’s also easy to clean and doesn’t take lots of space in the kitchen. It is just the right choice for coffee lovers.
1305,5.0,2018-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"OMG My built in Miele coffee maker died after 14 years. I read reviews on the Miele and decided not to spend 4K on replacing it. I absolutely LOVE this machine, and purchased one for my daughter and her Italian hubby. The best expresso ever. Although, I make an Americano every morning. So delicious. I have always ground beans in the past, but my new Italian family from Florence use the Lavazza Ground coffee. That is what I am using and it is so smooth, strong and NOT bitter. Purchase this coffee maker...you will not be sorry."
1306,4.0,2019-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,I would recommend this bad a#% Machine to anyone very user-friendly and you get to call yourself you’re very own barista
1307,5.0,2021-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I didn't know a good grinder with the opportunity to change the grinding size would change the taste and quality of the coffee this much.! This machine is not cheap but you get every penny you pay back with the satisfaction.
I had other espresso machines earlier but this is way different level."
1308,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Works great except for one thing: sometimes the pressure isn’t high enough and the coffee comes out weak. It is super easy to clean though, and it’s great for my daily use."
1309,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The water inlet seal will wait to tear until the moment your warranty expires, then good luck getting help with it. It will start off small until finally a torrent until the reservoir has emptied. (no, I pulled the reservoir before that happened. If you can find a replacement, you will pay double for it or it will be eternally back-ordered. Choose your hell, because either way, you are the one stuck fixing it. I imagined that, with Breville, I was paying a lot, but still less considering the better quality. But, no. Really you are simply paying more for the same old junk. Sure enough, you don't always get what you pay for, but you'll certainly always pay for what you get.

Fortunately for me, though, some of the other seals jumped the gun and tore just before my warranty expired and I was sent new seals. Ha! Suckers! My machine broke too early. I'm sure it was a QC fluke.

While I'm at it, many of the features work, but are fussy (unreliable). Also, these things require quite a bit of upkeep too. Check into the maintenance commitment it requires before deciding on purchasing.
Conclusion: I don't think I would get another one."
1310,5.0,2021-04-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I dont have any real complaints.

Well made and appears durable. Too soon to know whether it will stand the test of time.

Love the convenient storage drawer which is attached to the drip tray. Recommend cleaning and drying the tray after use.

With a bit of instructions from YouTube and some practice, I was making cappuccino in no time.

I recommend buying a thermometer to monitor milk temp. At first I was scorching the milk."
1311,5.0,2021-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Recently purchased this Breville espresso machine, and having used it about 10 times, so far I love it. Relatively short learning curve where you'll probably toss out a few of the first shots you make (I did), but after you learn what you did wrong, you're off and making dynamite espresso/cappuccino etc. Frothing milk is a breeze. Overall, very satisfied. If it stands the test of time, I'll be very pleased."
1312,5.0,2021-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This review has been written after 3 weeks of usage. Really well made grinder and boiler. Best options available for my use and saves space with the built in grinder. Have been making multiple espresso shots daily for my wife and I along with friends who visit and it handles really well. The key is to buy freshly roasted beans and anybody can really use this machine for great espresso shots. For the options available, it really is a space efficient item. Buy it, watch some Youtube videos and enjoy never having to buy an overpriced espresso, latte, Americano, or cappuccino again."
1313,4.0,2022-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Good espresso maker. It has everything you need to make a good espresso. However, I would invest in a good tamper tool. Milk streaming is good but can use a little more power. It takes a good 1 min to steam a cup of milk."
1314,5.0,2020-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just got this machine a week ago and it makes a mean coffeehouse level espresso. I love my coffee and previously used the Aeropress and French press. After one week, i cant see myself going back after using this product. It takes a little practice to get the hang of the ratios of milk when using the steamer if you want to try milk based espresso drinks (I accidentally make lattes when I am trying to make cappuccinos.) Either way, I’m not too upset at my lack of skills because the coffee tastes amazing. I totally recommend the Barista Express."
1315,5.0,2020-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,We decided to purchase this for our Christmas gift. I read the reviews and also searched online. We LOVE this machine. Christmas morning we had amazing espresso drinks. It’s easy to use and easy to clean. I also researched coffee so had more knowledge before I purchased the machine and coffee. It paid off we are both loving our espressos in the morning.
1316,5.0,2020-02-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far so good. I think it’s already paid for itself with how much we were previously going to coffee shops and Starbucks. Wife and I love it after 3 months of use. However I’ll check back in in a year or two if there are any issues with the grinder since that seems to be the most popular long term issue people mention.
1317,5.0,2017-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased about a month ago, and have made more lattes than I can count since then. As a newbie, it took awhile to dial in correctly. Still not perfect, the puck can be a bit wet even when the pull time & pressure are right on, but sure that it is me, not the machine. Best so far has been the Starbucks Expresso beans from Costco. Even the worst expressos have made great lattes, to my taste as good as from local roasters/espresso shops.

In short, so far couldn't be more happy!"
1318,5.0,2021-05-13, Black Sesame," This is a turnkey solution to perfect coffee. I finally understand and can taste the difference between different beans from different regions of the world.

Furthermore, with a little trial end error one can adjust grind size and tamping pressure to adjust the acidity level of the finished cup of coffee.

I have to admit that spending nearly $600 on a coffee pot was a BIG purchase with lots of potential for buyers remorse. Now that I have had this machine for 2 months, there are NO REGRETS at all."
1319,5.0,2019-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This thing is stellar! I’ve never wanted to get up in the morning as much as I do now I owe this machine. As long as your coffee is good, you'll get and awesome espresso from this machine every time. I am still trying to get the foamer to make microfoam for latte art, but I think it’s more my inability than any fault in the machine. My friends and wife love the coffee this makes. Find your local toaster, get their finest espresso bean and grind the freshest coffee they have. You won’t be disappointed. I haven’t bought a coffee outside my home in quite a while now !"
1320,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,My issues were with the grinder. It was too inconsistent. I couldn't get a great shot dialed in even with the PID. I recommend getting a separate grinder and a less expensive machine if you want to try to pull great shots.
1321,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought the 870XL in 2013 as a gift to myself after 22 years of Service to the US Air Force. I use this machine daily and often times multiple times a day. I have never had any servicing done outside of the periodic “clean me” cycles! This coffee machine is exemplary and every cup is perfect. Full of flavor, perfect crema, and delicious! Continually serves up one cup after another of exception coffee no matter the style. Wether you are doing Espresso, Americano, Latte, Macchiato, Cappuccino, Mocha....it delivers high quality, barista style perfection each time. I have used virtually exclusively LavAzza Crema e Aroma coffee beans and they produce an amazing cup of coffee, no matter the style you are making. Still maintains great water pressure, temperature, and dosing. The product line is superior and would highly recommend any of the Breville product line, but especially the coffee machines"
1322,5.0,2021-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After watching youtube videos and reading, finally, I was able to brew perfect coffee. Nowadays, I hate starbucks or other outside coffee when I can personally brew best coffee at home.

There is some learning curve when you want to brew single shot of expresso vs double shot of expresso :)"
1323,3.0,2019-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I used Nespreso for about 15 years. I wanted to use my own coffee, so I bought this machine.

This is not a Simple machine to use.

1- You constantly have to clean it. daily
2- You constantly have to tinker with the settings.
3- The coffee changes daily and it drys, so you have to change the grinding setting and how much coffee you are using
4- To balance how fine the coffee is and how much you are dispensing is a guessing game.
5- one in every 10 times I use it I get the creamy draw from the machine. If the gauge go to the max, the coffee is bitter even if the beans are fresh.

I buy the coffee from a local roaster"
1324,5.0,2018-04-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,After a few attempts at tamping the espresso and failing I realized I was pushing too hard. It isn't as difficult to use as I thought which was why I hesitated on purchasing it sooner. It is one of my favorite purchases. We use it many times a day and has been a wonderful addition to my kitchen. I agree with other reviewers you should purchase washcloths to help with clean up. My personal advise is if you like white chocolate mocha from Starbucks you need to purchase Fontana white chocolate mocha syrup. It really makes a wonderful white choc mocha.
1325,5.0,2019-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,This was my first foray back into true home espresso after having a super-automatic for a lot of years. The superauto made good coffee but not great espresso. This takes a little learning and a touch of fiddling and figuring out grind but once you get it dialed in this thing just flat works. Love it!!
1326,5.0,2021-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is really amazing, and I can't believe I waited so long to purchase one. If you're on the fence, take a chance! You won't regret it. It does take a bit to figure out how to make the best tasting drinks, but once you do it's worth it. Not to mention it's extremely easy to use even if you've never used a machine like this before."
1327,5.0,2020-09-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,If you choose to buy it is very easy to use
1328,5.0,2019-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine! I’ve worked in coffee shops for 5+ years and this was my go to in order for me to have at home espresso!
1329,5.0,2021-03-08, Black Sesame,This machine is truly amazing like the grinder works perfectly and it makes an amazing espresso. It’s truly worth the investment.
1330,5.0,2021-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the best machine I've owned.
Its extremely simple to use, my boyfriend was even able to figure it out.
I love the hot water for my tea, it shuts off automatically at 8oz which is perfect.
I love that I don't have to measure my ground out with this machine because it does everything for me.
This machine is perfect for everyone."
1331,3.0,2017-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worked as advertised exactly one time. The next day, I went to make another latte and no water was coming out of the head. I tried a few times and nothing was happening. Yet I burned through a lot of water... Turns out it was all going into the tray. Steam worked, but that was about it. I tried it also without the portafilter and it even then it was just was sending all the water into the tray. Returned.

UPDATE: Got a new one from different store (Amazon no longer had the color I wanted) and it's working great. Upgraded to 3 stars. It's probably a 4-5 star machine, but since the first one was pretty much DOA, we get 3 for now."
1332,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine for the price and can't believe I lived so long without an espresso machine. My reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the pressure gauge doesn't work as described in the manual. One of the reasons I bought this particular machine was for the gauge to have more control. When I contacted Breville I was told to not pay attention to the pressure gauge just pay attention to the quality of the espresso shot. This is a bit frustrating but not sure it's worth returning yet.
1333,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,It takes some experience to find the right coffee beans and grind. Once we found the beans we like there was no turning back. We love our coffee. The Breville Barista is very easy to use and makes a great espresso.
1334,5.0,2021-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I can attest to the post regarding how to get the correct extraction pressure. Manually grind a small amount, tap it on the counter, repeat until you have the desired amount required to use the tamp. Not only did it reach the correct extraction pressure, but the crema was perfect and the taste was spot on. I made several cups to make sure I could reliably repeat the process and it worked every time. Ths machine replaced a Saeco Odea Giro which was 8 years old and had seen better days. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this machine to anyone not afraid to move away from a Super Automatic machine. Sorry, gotta go I have another cup to drink."
1335,5.0,2014-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine for my husband as a christmas present (well for me too ;) ) . We are not espresso snobs but do enjoy a great cup of espresso or cappucino. This machine has a lot of different gadgets and settings . Initially we couldn't get the machine to automatically extract the perfect shot. It took us a few days of playing with it (a lot!!!) and now neither of us uses the automatic settings . We figured out how to manually grind the amount of coffee we wanted into the portafilter and then we manually extract either a single or a double shot of espresso perfectly.

Overall I must say we have been extremely happy with it ."
1336,5.0,2020-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,My Starbucks home espresso machine finally gave up and I settled on this Breville. I struggled with the high cost but in the end I made the right decision. This is super simple use after following the instructions and some practice. Using the same beans (Cafe Bustelo) and milk I am now making amazing cappuccinos. So silky smooth! This beats what I can get at coffee shops and is such a huge improvement over my old machine. I am amazed at what a difference the right machine can make.
1337,5.0,2019-05-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As someone who worked as a barista in a coffee shop for over a decade, I find that this machine does just enough for that feeling of being a barista that I find myself enjoying an good espresso more than I have with other espresso machine I have had in the past. It may be that the grinder is built in but it will make a latte as well as the barista at the local coffee shop. So it has left me satisfied with my pirchase"
1338,5.0,2021-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It makes great coffee! The steamer is a little on the soft side compared to professional coffee makers.

This is probably the best purchase I've made since COVID WFH started."
1339,4.0,2021-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This makes great espressos, which is the most important factor. The only reason I docked it a start is that it doesn't have a water sensor, which seems like a no-brainer. Otherwise, it's a great machine and I would still buy it again."
1340,5.0,2022-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my coffee addicted Girlfriend. She'd hit Starbucks twice a day (at least)

Well, I'll try and keep this as short as possible. For her, she figured this thing out quick. She had it all adjusted and was brewing in no time. She also locked in a perfect recipe (4 pumps white mocha, 2 pumps hazelnut, steamed almond milk) and stuck with it. Now, even with buying syrup, coffee, cups, and white mocha sauce, we're still much cheaper than starbucks.

This is a really easy to use, high quality brewing machine. It cleans quick and easy, brews quick, easy, and consistant, and is an all around good machine. The steep price tag is because you get quality and while I'm not rich (I had to save my pennies), I will say it was well worth it."
1341,3.0,2021-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worked great at first but quickly started leaking which has been a problem that hasn’t gone away. Following all instructions and up keeping on my cleaning and descaling my espresso shots never turn out. Total waste of money.
1342,5.0,2020-07-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and we have enjoyed using it every day. The instruction booklet can be a bit intimidating, but it was very helpful in learning how to use the machine. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. We were able to quickly dial in the proper grind size and grind amount for single shots of espresso. Double shots are proving a bit more difficult to perfect. I use  Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag  also found on Amazon. The steam wand steams milk quickly and makes delicious lattes. In fact, we only drink lattes now and have relegated our drip coffee maker to storage in the basement. I have given up trying to make latte art as I am not at all artistically inclined.

You will not be disappointed with the Breville Barista Express."
1343,5.0,2019-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am IN LOVE with this expresso maker. It truly is so easy to use and makes perfect lattes and machiattos etc! I love hazelnut machiattos but I would find when I bought them at coffee shops they would add way to much sugar. I love that I can add the flavoring I like and even without flavoring, the taste is exceptional. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. I also feel like the quality you get for this price is amazing!"
1344,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was very excited about getting my Barista Espresso machine and got it on a Saturday, it came in perfect condition. The only problem I had was that the grinder would not grind the beans. ""I was devastated having to use my coffee grinder for the weekend. I called Monday morning and found that you had to put a couple of handfuls of rice through the grinder and then ""walla"" it worked perfect.
I was not used to the amount of espresso that came out of the unit. I did find out the proper amount was 1 oz for 1 cup and 2 oz for a 2 cup.
The only complaint is that nowhere in the instructions did it tell me I had to prime the grinder first. I was told by customer service that this model was a newer model.
No more Starbucks!"
1345,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had this for about two months now. I bought this for my husband as a gift and he absolutely loves it! He does, however, feel that the grinder could be a lot better, we typically use our electric grinder for our beans, but overall, it is a wonderful starter espresso machine and we highly recommend it!"
1346,5.0,2018-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Been using this espresso machine for a while now. Now I don’t use my nespresso espresso machine anymore. It’s easy use. But takes a little practice. Enjoy the process of making coffee from starch.
1347,5.0,2018-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great quality started with the automatic button but now I do the manual to get a better pre infusion and more consistent pull amount. It really nice having the built in grinder.
1348,5.0,2022-03-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"after traveling to europe and Australia for work and tasting their amazing coffee I realized I needed to make a life change. Ordered this after seeing the great reviews and found a local coffee roaster for fresh beans. Am very satisfied with the machine and the quality of coffee it makes. Make sure to find a local roaster of beans and use them up within 2 weeks of the roasting date for the best quality coffee. Would definitely recommend to others! Only negative on this machine is the quality of the stainless steel tray, it scratches very easily."
1349,5.0,2021-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"5 months of daily use and it's still going. I hope that we can get at least a couple years out of it for the price. My only complaint is that it takes some time for the steam to build up. I guess this is just what we deal with at this price point (even though it certainly isn't an inexpensive product). Other than that, with a little practice I have been able to pull a perfect shot 90% of the time. Some of my beans dried out a bit and I realized that some adjustments are required to the grind and/or tamping to compensate. This gets a bit tricky. Overall it's been a great kitchen tool and we love the finished product."
1350,1.0,2017-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have owned two of these machines. The first one we bought was refurbished and lasted 3 years before it started pulling crummy shots and the boiler went out about a month later. We loved the quality of latte it produced and we thought it broke bc it was a refurbished machine to begin with, so we bought a new one from amazon July 2019. Well, it is now 2 months out of warranty, and the boiler is starting to go out again. We have not changed coffee beans, grind amount, or grind size, yet, it’s starting to pull inconsistent shots, with difficulty getting to pressure. I maintain it regularly with descalings and cleanings. We only use bottled water in the reservoir. Yet, the machine is failing. I doubt it will last another month. I am HIGHLY disappointed with this company and find it very underhanded that they only offer a 1 year warranty but design a product that doesn’t last much longer than that. I spent a considerable amount of money for something built so poorly that it doesn’t last more than 3 years refurbished or even 2 years brand new. My advice is to save your money and pick a machine from a different company- I mean seriously- am I expected to spend 600+ dollars every two years on a new machine?? This is crazy! For that much money, a thing should last much longer than that."
1351,5.0,2014-09-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s pricey but in the end, the money I’ll save from going to some over priced coffee shop makes it worth it. Use it every morning. Making the foam is obviously my favorite part ;0)"
1352,5.0,2020-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great Machine!! Works perfectly and easy to use!!
1353,5.0,2020-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this espresso machine for 4 months and we've made a LOT of lattes. It took me maybe 10 minutes to read the manual, set the dials and try it out. It's easy to use and hasn't had a problem since I purchased it. I love it so much that I got one for my daughter for a house-warming gift. We use this every single day and it's saved me a ton of money going to coffee shops. This does not disappoint and is a quality espresso machine without spending thousands."
1354,5.0,2021-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I use this little sucker all the time! Very easy to use. Makes a mean cuppa! Very pleased with my purchase
1355,5.0,2021-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use just got it today and already making best coffee and espresso I’ve ever had can’t wait to break in fully highly recommended
1356,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Only way I could make this is thru this espresso machine. I love the taste and I love using it. I can control the quality of coffee that I drink. That means less stomach acid. We havent gone to Starbucks since our vacation. 👍 Cost effective. 🥰
1357,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve been using this espresso machine for a few months now and love it. I make a latte for my wife and I daily. Makes delicious espresso and excellent steamed milk. No complaints. Everything the machine does, it does really well and there is a lot of great attention to detail and thought put into the design of the machine. Would absolutely buy again if I had to do it over."
1358,2.0,2019-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE:
I needed to use the warranty. Twice. :/
My second machine died 10 months in, but thankfully it was covered under warranty and was replaced. 18 months of happiness until that machine died and since I'm a glutton for punishment I gave it one more shot. You guessed it, that one is also dead. I didn't abuse them or make crazy amounts of coffee (only made 2-3 lattes daily), I maintained them according to the manual; cleaning the portafilters and the tank, I used filters and never used oily coffee in the grinder. After going through 4 machines in 5 years and taking up a good share of a landfill, you might want to reconsider the Breville.

Love, love, love. So I'm a bit apprehensive to review this because I still think of the all those bad reviews stating their machine broke down after a year. My machine is only nine months old, but I feel that I need to share the love. This machine is A M A Z I N G.
This is, however, the second one I got (the first one arrived broken) I'm still giving it five stars because Amazon let me return it with absolutely no hassle. We did get the amazon extended warranty, but hoping we won't need to use it! I don't think I would have ever purchased this on my own ~ it's so extravagant, but thankfully I have an amazing husband that spoils me. Did I mention I LOVE my machine?!"
1359,5.0,2020-07-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine! It produces high quality espresso , and is an all in machine. This product is worth every penny!"
1360,5.0,2019-08-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it 😍 Exactly what you expect from your espresso maker - perfect tool for a perfect espresso flavor - now you must take in consideration a good espresso need some time and attention. So you need approximately 12 minutes. Keep in mind delicious coffee beans and a great brewing recipe. Another helpful tip the next time you're in your favorite coffee shop, watch the barista closely. There's a lot that goes into the perfect shot of espresso."
1361,5.0,2021-07-02, Black Sesame,Amazing!!! Totally worth the money. I had a DeLonghi $200 machine for years and I completely regret waiting so long to upgrade. I struggled a bit pulling a food shot with the beans I had until I read into he manual there is a secondary way to adjust to grinder. Now i am able to grind these beans a bit finer and consistently pulling awesome shots.
1362,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,very happy with the results and the machine is reasonably priced
1363,5.0,2019-08-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Every morning I wake up with a smile on my face and thank my lucky stars that this machine is in my life. I love my wife, I love my children and now I love this machine. It is perfect and makes the perfect espresso. I am now trying all different types of coffee, knowing that I am pulling the perfect shots and getting exactly what the roasters intend from their beans. Grind, tamp, pull, feedback from the pressure gauge, hot water, steam, this machine Simply does it ALL!"
1364,4.0,2019-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Received as gift from my wife, it's a lovely unit but I was a tad disappointed to discover it was a used and not new unit, the ad seems to indicate it was new. Water filter was missing, and when I ran the first of the water through the portafilter (where the ground espresso goes), coffee grounds were apparent in the basket. I wiped the underside where the portafilter locks in and found more grounds, definitely not new and unused. I didn't say anything to my wife to diminish the joy of her gift. Aside from this, a lovely unit that makes wonderful espresso."
1365,5.0,2017-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use to make great espresso or americano's. The bean grinder is a must have feature. Quality of the coffee is comparable to machines 3 to 4 times the price.
1366,4.0,2020-11-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had it for over a month, great machine! Daughter graduated, turned 18 & moved out this week. So I bought her the same machine."
1367,5.0,2021-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been using this espresso machine for many years now making 2-4 cappuccino a day without having a single issue. Used another model without the grinder for over 10 years, only stopped using it because I wanted a grinder built-in."
1368,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,1.5 weeks into my use of the 870XL. I realize I was just drinking brown water using my french press compared to the expresso I'm getting from this model for my americano each morning. It took me a few days to get the extraction right but now I am getting a consistent double expresso after adjusting the grind. Using preground decaf for my wife and having a little more difficulty getting into the correct extraction range but I hit it this morning for her latte. Unit is easy to use. The wand is producing good quality milk and froth for the latte. I highly recommend if the unit keeps functioning at its current level.
1369,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love the express. I don't have any complaining about noise. The machine gets warm very fast.
It is easy to clean.
I just don't like the grinder because It spreads everywhere. Also, you have to push the container in order to coffee goes to grinder.
So, 4 starts because of the grinder and the way the machine pulls the coffee from container. Even so I love the final result.:)"
1370,4.0,2019-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The grinding function is a mess, the coffee grounds fall everywhere, and quite a good amount too. I've taken to using a small tupper-ware container to collect errant grounds as a consequence. The machine is set to pull strong shots with very fine grounds, stretto style. Two doubles in the morning, and I'm good. I would prefer a machine about 100 dollars cheaper, without the grinder. My parents have a setup like that and though it seems less efficient, it is far less clumsy than what you get here."
1371,5.0,2020-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine is excellent quality, works perfectly and allows for a lot of manual variation in grind, temper, press etc.
Heats quickly, quality of espresso is great! The machine is nice looking as well. Very happy with this purchase."
1372,5.0,2021-08-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Replaced older expresso machine of 10 years Saco model. Best purchase true expresso machine which allows personal preference set up of doses that allowed for flavor I really wanted. Big learning curve but worth every penny.
1373,4.0,2020-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The coffee tastes great if you overfill the basket a little and stuff it in. It's not fully automatic, so you still have to tweak it to get it to your taste. Despite the built-in grinder, you still end up with a mess on the machine and even on the counter. Less than perfect, but I still like it."
1374,5.0,2016-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is hands-down the best espresso machine on the market for the money. We’ve been using it 20 times a day for the last YEAR, and it’s still going strong! Zero issues. Super simple to use. Who can say that about any product on the market now-days?

Thank you, Breville engineers, for building a quality product built to “last!”

Sincerely,
Forever Loyal Coffee Addicts"
1375,5.0,2020-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine was in my amazon cart for 6 months until I finally was sure that I want it. Since it’s quiet an investment I just didn’t want to be an impulsive buyer. But I haven’t had any regrets ever since and making my morning coffee is the favorite part of a day for me. You have to read the instructions and I would also recommend watching couple videos on YouTube so you know how to use/clean it properly and don’t freak out if a coffee bean gets stuck in a grinder. Great quality, size, appearance!"
1376,2.0,2021-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I use this is just a once in a while afternoon latte machine...I stop every morning at my local roastery. I use their beans and they have given me all the tips to make consistent coffee with this machine. It was great at first, but then I started having issues with the pressure gauge. Now it doesn't work at all. I started googling and it seems I am not alone with my issue! Fortunately the coffee still tastes good, but for $600 I would assume the gauge would not break after making a latte a week for a year. And I did all the trouble shooting and have always used distilled water in the machine...I also clean it regularly which the cleaning light has never even come on but since it sits for such long periods with out use I clean it anyways. So just maybe spend your money elsewhere...just not built to last!"
1377,5.0,2022-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There’s a bit of a learning curve, but once you get it figured out for your specific bean this is great. I recommend using a whole bean from a local coffee roaster."
1378,5.0,2019-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Took some tinkering and getting used to, you really have to play with the settings to get it right, but once you do, goodness does it make killer espresso! Though since is not a $1,000+ machine, it's not perfect. For instance, it is LOUD, my husband gets up early for work, and I can usually hear him using the machine through our thin apartment walls. The water tank also leaks into the drip tray, why? I have no idea, but we need to dump the tray every couple days or so. For the price though, definitely a 5 star machine!"
1379,5.0,2021-07-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,life is not worth living without this little machine! it makes great expresso and latte. i will never go visit the starbucks! easy to use and very well build. it is fun to use and great conversations starter
1380,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worth every penny. We use it multiple times a day
1381,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this to replace the one the ex took. I have to say the old one he took worked just as well as this brand new one after four years of his misuse. Thank God it has auto shut off. Set up is quick n easy.
1382,5.0,2021-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We got this a year and a half ago and it has easily paid for itself by avoiding coffee shops for our almost-daily americano and latte. Easy to use and clean. Only issue encountered is that oily (shiny) beans clog up and the hopper needs to be knocked to loosen them up, but is not an issue for dull beans. The adjustable grind is great for getting the optimal taste from different brands of beans. We have gotten rid of our Keurig and use this daily."
1383,5.0,2019-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I do not regret one dollar of this purchase months after buying it. If you are a starbucks addict like I was, here is your cure. It's small enough to not take up much counter space and incredibly efficient at doing what it's designed to do. It's easy to use, too. My only complaint (which is likely due to user error) is that I can never get extraction times to be as long as the manual states they should and the steaming wand is LOUD. Espresso still tastes great and the steaming wand is still going strong."
1384,5.0,2020-11-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love love looovvveeee this machine. My friend bought one and it took one latte from her to convince myself to buy one.
This sucker is so easy to use. Disclaimer: I spent many years working for a coffee shop, so I am knowledgeable with all this bruhaha, but this machine makes it very very easy for someone with no experience.

Nothing beats waking up and being able to make myself a latte."
1385,5.0,2020-10-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s very easy to use and it makes great espresso. It looks nice on our counter and it’s well made. I was intimidated at first so I let my husband figure it out. He showed me how and it gets easier and less intimidating with every use. The most important piece of advice would be not to forget to put the basket into the portafilter. That will throw the pressure off and scare the crap out of you. Luckily that one mistake resulted in no damage. Now I need to learn how to make cool foam designs...
1386,5.0,2021-10-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’m embarrassed to say it, but this made me so happy. It brought me right back to Italy. Silly that a thing can make you so happy but it’s true."
1387,5.0,2020-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My last breville 860 lasted for more than 7 years with no issues, decided to upgrade to this new model and it still amazing. The only difference between this one and old model is the pressure seems like higher, and it pre-drip function. The drip cover changed to metal which is nice. And the coffee bean holder changed to round shape which can hold more. Totally love my breville and I’ll never choose other espresso machine.."
1388,5.0,2013-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For coffee lovers, this is an investment. This machine has not let us down, and continues to pump out gorgeous shots. If you are a beginner to espresso making, this is a good machine to get yourself acquainted with the practice. It is not designed to be “push-button” coffee-making, so don’t expect it. The versatility of the machine allows customization and flexibility perfect for home use. We are incredibly satisfied with this product and enjoy using it everyday!"
1389,5.0,2020-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Honestly, I was surprised by how flimsy some of the plastic bits feel and how loose some of the machined parts fit together. For the price you kind of expect airtight metal work and sturdy, stiff, close-tolerance plastic pieces. finish aside, it produces a great espresso. The grinder is great, and the steam wand is plenty powerful enough to get the job done. The water tank is big enough to get you through a morning, but plan on refilling often. And emptying the drip tray almost daily."
1390,5.0,2018-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’m a huge coffee lover. Or coffee snob for that matter. This machine makes an excellent espresso pour. It is fresh and the texture is superb for a home coffee machine. Each time I make one for a guest, they can’t believe how good it is. You’re welcome Breville for the repeat business ;-)

There are a couple of little quirks with the machine, but overall it’s still 5 stars in my book."
1391,5.0,2019-09-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best semi automatic machine.
Theres a slight learning curve to it but if you read and follow the instructions carefully you’ll be a home barista in no time.
The grinder is awesome, the frother makes amazing microfoam. Use Lavazza Super Crema beans and you’ll be in coffee heaven. The money i save not going to starbucks has more tham paid for the machine."
1392,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolutely love this device. Brews great coffee.
My advice - study the manual. There are a lot of features. Also, with every new brand of coffee you need to readjust a lot of things to make it brew with the rights pressure.
My only negative would be that there is no indicator of the water level. You need to look around and back (witch is against the wall usually) to see whats the water level. And its hard to see sometimes."
1393,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is a step up for somebody that wants to get into really high-quality espresso or cappuccino. My main decision was between getting a machine like this (which has both the espresso machine and the grinder) to getting seperatly the machine and grinder. I think the choice I mad was good. This machine produces great shots. You can fine-tune your grind as per you coffee, program your shots time, and most importantly, adjust your grind\quantity\compaction based on the pressure gauge."
1394,5.0,2019-09-20, Black Sesame,"Everything was exactly what I was looking for in making a quality good cup of coffee in the morning. Only problem was since I am using this machine every morning is the cleaning light came on a little sooner then I would of liked. So when I went to clean the machine as directed in the manual, I'm missing the cleaning filter that's needed. My machine never came with it? It was missing? So now I have a great coffee machine that needs to be cleaned and I don't have the parts to do so?"
1395,5.0,2020-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So , so , so glad we purchased. Every morning i wake up to a vanilla latte and absolutely love it. Thought $500 was a lot for a coffe machine but just do the math and this thing pays for itself if you love your espresso drinks.

It takes a little bit to figure out the right amount of grounds and how to get the pressure right. The manual was extremely helpful and there are some great videos out there to help"
1396,5.0,2020-06-26, Black Sesame,"I am not a professional barista or I will ever become one. But this Breville express machine can make anyone a good barista! The quality of this product is excellent, purchased it almost a year ago and still running like it was new. I use it once or twice a day and I have tried so many different beans and I don't miss my trips going to starbucks! The machine is worth every penny and if you look at the big picture, you will see how much money you can save making your lattes, americano, cappuccinos at home. And much better then most coffe shops. The milk frother takes time to perfect it but a quick search for some videos online and you will be able to master the technique.
Overall thumbs up for this machine!"
1397,5.0,2021-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to set up and get going. Worked exactly as expected. Getting the hot water and milk frothing working properly took some time, but wasn't a machine issue - more of a learning curve.
You need to get used to emptying the waste bin frequently - every three days or so for the two of us, so likely daily for a family of coffee drinkers."
1398,5.0,2014-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine - very fun to use. Every morning my wife and I each have three cappuccinos. Grinder works great - I was a little concerned since it is built it - but really is well built. The cleaning and descaling functions are really simple.
1399,5.0,2021-02-20, Black Sesame,LOVEEEE. Finally got my dream machine this year and am so in love with it every day. Worth the money no doubt!
1400,5.0,2019-08-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine makes amazing Expresso. We’ve had it a couple years and then bought it again for my son and daughter in law. They love it too!
1401,1.0,2019-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Stopped working within a year. Unable to use warranty because of course we dropped it while transferring it from our camper to the house to send it in for warranty work.

There was also an issue where the grind meets the machine (don't know what part that is called) being coated in a teflon material that is bubbling and breaking off now. Clearly this was not designed or daily use.

We put the thing in the trash. Won't buy something from Breville again. This is just a pretty espresso maker for people that might make something once a month. If you make several shots a day you need something else."
1402,5.0,2021-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine lives up to the reviews, it is one of the best small/entry-level makers on the market for the money!"
1403,4.0,2020-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Still mastering exactly how this works - need to find tune the grind, etc"
1404,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great purchase for saving money and time at the coffee shops! Easy to figure out. We make steamers for the kids, I like creamy foamy coffees, and my husband does straight espresso. We use it multiple times a day!"
1405,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"An impressive all in one espresso maker with a small footprint. It's easy to use, and hard to screw up with this little wonder. From the bur grinder to the tool drawer, this is one awesome espresso maker. I'm never drinking drip coffee again!

Only criticism would be that it takes a while for the steam to get started, and sometimes it will cut out when you're in the middle of steaming milk. The steam ""dial"" is also REALLY hard to turn, especially when it's on and (I'm assuming) under pressure."
1406,5.0,2019-12-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s an absolute marvel of a product, if you can afford it! I love coffee and love making that espresso art in the mix. I was surprised how great of this machine is when it comes to mixes and grinding the coffee beans. I absolutely love the purchase even though it is a bit pricy. But it’s an absolute addition to coffee lovers like myself to have."
1407,5.0,2020-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just made the best latte I’ve ever had with this machine! Don’t get me wrong, it takes some experimentation, but that’s part of the fun. The first day, all I made was bitter, burnt espresso, but with some tweaking of the settings, I’m now regularly making the very best!!! The other machine I have is a Keurig Rivo, and I recommend that if you want something more automatic. But, man, if you get some good beans, grind them fresh, and know what you’re doig, you can’t beat a Breville!"
1408,5.0,2017-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine makes the most delicious coffee. Daily I make the Americano (long black) for my husband and a Latte for myself. I've also made espresso for company. Like anything new there is a learning curve but stick with it and you'll be a Barista in no time. The instruction book is helpful plus I found a few videos online. It's easy to clean.
1409,5.0,2022-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes excellent espresso and it looks fantastic in my kitchen. At $600 it's a little spendy, but in about 8 months it will pay for itself with fewer visits to the coffeeshop. I'm very happy with the purchase."
1410,5.0,2021-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine has forever changed how I drink coffee!! I don't have to go to a Starbucks anymore and with me roasting my own coffee beans I have officially become a ""Coffee Snob"". I would recommend this machine to anyone that enjoys coffee, it's easy to use and once you adjust the grind and amount of coffee you will have very consistent taste. I also recommend the Costco Expresso beans for under 10.00 for two pounds for those who don't roast their own beans. I've had this machine since Christmas 2016 and even my wife makes coffee its that easy. We are buying another machine as a wedding gift.....enjoy"
1411,5.0,2019-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Though I have been using the product for only about a week, I can confirm others' impressions. This is a very solid machine that produces great espresso. I had other espresso machines like these, including from Illy (Francis Francis), DeLonghi, and Saeco, but this one strikes just the right balance between customizability (amount and granularity of coffee; amount of water; pressure) and convenience.

Having said that, it is not a fully automatic press-the-button thing. And if you don't really want to get ""your hands dirty"" you should go for something else. Another thing to consider is that whenever you switch to different coffee beans, you may need to recalibrate the settings.

In fact, the machine really is a semi-professional espresso maker resembling professional espresso machines."
1412,5.0,2021-02-20, Black Sesame,I had a steam espresso maker for years until it finally gave up the ghost. Coughed up the money for this one due to the wife's love of great espresso and her promise to stop paying $$ for espresso at Starbucks. Had this model since last Christmas and works great. The pressure gage is definitely a must as you try to figure out how to pack the grinds correctly.
1413,4.0,2021-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is about the sixth espresso machine that I have owned and it is the best one so far. Makes as good of espresso as you can get from a barista. I use the double wall filters as they give you the best crème. I don't use the grinder or heat milk with it so I don't know how they work.
1414,5.0,2021-06-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolutely love this, my boyfriend and I both use it every single morning and it is absolutely perfect. Super customizable so you can pull a perfect shot no matter what beans you are using. The double walled filter basket is included which would be super helpful for anybody who is a little less experienced and wouldn't know how to adjust the settings exactly. If I would have any complaints about the machine at all, it's the lack of control over the steam wand, but it does the job just fine. I don't think you can get a better machine in this price range and most people wouldn't know the difference between this and a machine that is a couple thousand dollars."
1415,5.0,2020-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville is a very very nice machine. We had a Bosch Benvenuto b20 for many years; and an interior tube burst. (I ordered a replacement tube from Bosch, which I installed, and that machine works great at my office now)

But in the meantime I bought the Breville, and my wife says the coffee I make with this machine is even better than what comes from the Benvenuto.

The Breville is also simpler; with you doing the grinding of coffee and putting it in the infuser, and so on; which will make the machine work longer, I would expect."
1416,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love everything about this machine! A little overwhelming at first, but very easy to use and clean! It makes amazing expresso and I loved the built in grinder."
1417,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have had this model for almost 6 years now. No problems works great. Once set you have consistent coffee everytime. Ordered a second one that's still in the box so when our original finally goes we have another one ready. Absolutely love this machine!!!
1418,5.0,2020-09-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,It takes about a week to learn the best method of brewing an espresso to your taste but it is EXCELLENT. The instruction book is very good and set-up is easy. I never used an espresso machine before but it is great.
1419,4.0,2020-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very underwhelming. You get what you pay for I guess but better options out there
1420,5.0,2021-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is now my third machine. We wore one out over years of use at work before a rubber seal died. We dropped one - still worked but the base meant it was unstable and could really be used, and now this one. Always the same quality machine. Makes a fantastic coffee and can withstand a large amount of use (and abuse). Can take a few seconds for the pump to switch across to steam/hot water, but thats just a small price to pay for the price point this machine is at."
1421,5.0,2021-08-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It takes a bit of practice (and patience) to get things right but when you do, you will never look back. I use Lavazza Super Crema with this machine and it has pretty much ruined most other coffees/espresso for me. Read the instructions (booklet) carefully when setting up initially and you will be greatly rewarded. I can’t recommend this machine enough."
1422,5.0,2016-08-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Overall, this makes excellent espresso. It takes a little time and practice to figure out the right grind size and amount, but once you get it, it is very consistent. Very happy with it. Surprisingly easy to clean and maintain."
1423,5.0,2019-03-08, Black Sesame,"Amazing top quality and best on the market..
2nd one i have gotten the first one i got 4 years ago and is still works as its new , 2nd one gift to my parents 😁"
1424,5.0,2020-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is legitimately my favorite I have ever worked with (professional barista). Look at some of the other reviews on here for more product information, but honestly I don't usually write reviews and wanted to give this product my ringing endorsement. Legitimately worth the money."
1425,5.0,2018-08-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I work at a coffee bar in a whole foods and this machine is almost like having it at home. It was just a little frustrating learning the grind size to grind dose ratio but YouTube is very helpful. I absolutely love this machine and it will replace me having to go to a coffee shop. 100% recommend this machine
1426,5.0,2020-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this for my parents after our trip to Europe this summer. They are both 70 and it took them a while to get used to it. It isn't a fully automatic unit like they were used to. They had to watch me make them coffee, then watch a few youtube videos, then they got the hang of it. Now they love it, and I get to enjoy it too when I'm visiting. Win-win! Life is too short to live without good coffee in the morning."
1427,5.0,2021-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My husband and I knew very little about espresso machines when we first started getting into making our own cappuccinos. Eventually we decided to upgrade to a nice machine. All of my research and product reviews pointed me to Breville. This machine is amazing. If you’re new at making espresso, it’s super easy. If you’re an expert at espresso it’s customizable."
1428,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So Far I love it. Had it for 2 weeks and finally can make a coffee as good as Star B. Bought the syrups to make different coffee drinks. Takes 30 seconds to heat the water. Use the hot water and steam features instead of the microwave. Use the factory recommend settings to get the perfect grind and amount of coffee.

(UPDATE) Have been using it daily for 10 Months. When we have guests I will make 4-6 cappuccinos in a row. This product has exceeded
may expectations. That does not happen very often. (Buy the warranty because there is a lot to this machine. Pump, heater, grinder etc."
1429,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is not easy to use *properly*. If you want to waste coffee thinking you are drinking espresso, and you want a counter flex, then get this. Otherwise, keep in mind that it takes a lot of trials and errors and adjusting the grinding level, how hard you push, how much you grind to get the right extract.

On the streamer side, after a couple of weeks of using the product, it gets really hard to turn the steam value knob with one hand. You can play around and get a good foam, but again you need to learn what you are doing."
1430,5.0,2021-05-19, Black Sesame,"5 stars. I have only had it a day but it is already impressed me! As a coffee snob (I grew up in Portland OR & owned an espresso shop), I have been ""espresso challenged"" since moving to the south. Sixbucks (Starbucks) is all people know when it comes to coffee/ espresso....or the second fav here is Dunkin Doughnuts (help!!)

Super easy to use. The grind is perfect. The crema is delightful and it draws the perfect amount before watering down your shots. With a bag of beans from a local roaster or even TJ Maxx, I have the best Almond latte a girl could ask for without the snobbery of the multi pierced, blue & purple haired, better than everyone, dude at the counter misspelling my name:)

Also looks cool on my counter too- JS"
1431,5.0,2020-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got into coffee tasting a few years ago, and found this AMAZING cafe-quality espresso machine.... the beans are ground fresh, with a number of grind settings to choose from; the steam wand takes maybe 10 seconds to steam, and it has instant hot water for tea. I can make machiattos, lattes, hot chocolate, and even soup (with the steam wand and my Breville Sous Chef Pro superbly grinding down veggies for soup) I've tested A LOT of appliances, and have officially decided to always buy Breville - they last for LIFE!"
1432,5.0,2014-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This has made my life immeasurably better. I quickly bought another for the office. Starbucks used to be my thing but now I can't believe I used to think that was decent coffee and espresso. Full price, discount, whatever, well worth the money."
1433,4.0,2019-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine but the pressure it is not working but the coffee is just super! Need to comunícate with the company to see what can I do!
1434,5.0,2020-08-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine is beyond awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Worth the investment, everything! It’s designed to please you! I can’t believe I did not get it earlier! I truly loved my previous machine, but this is just different level and quite awesome too!"
1435,5.0,2020-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes really good espresso based drinks. I use it every morning to make myself a latte and my wife a ""frappucino"" using our Vitamix to blend the espresso, milk, and ice. Fairly easy to use once you learn how. Stretching milk is definitely difficult to master... especially making latte art, but it's fun trying! Great machine at this price point."
1436,5.0,2021-08-13, Black Sesame,"I bought this as a Christmas present for myself, and so far I'm in love! It took some experimenting with tamping pressure, grind size, and amount of coffee to use, but once you have that down it's easy. I love my daily latte or cappuccino, it feels so luxurious to be able to make it here at home. I did find that I have to use the dual wall filter in order to get the correct brewing pressure, and the coffee comes out perfect! Would definitely recommend!"
1437,5.0,2021-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes such great coffee! So user friendly too! This was my first ever espresso machine and I figured it out pretty easily. I’m no latte art expert, but some of the reviews made the set up seem difficult, but it’s just like anything else where you have to glance at the instructions to put things together after unboxing. Definitely recommend this machine! It’s saving my wallet so much $$$ in the long run and I don’t have to sacrifice on the quality of my coffee. Win-win if you ask me!"
1438,4.0,2020-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine is amazing. My only beef with it is that you can't steam your milk while you pull a shot, especially because espresso goes bad in 30 seconds and it takes a while to get the milk hot. So I started steaming the milk first, which then makes the milk separate, so I just pull the shot after and then give the milk a little stir and it comes out great."
1439,5.0,2020-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought it for my wife and we love it
1440,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this espresso machine. I've had it know for about 3 months and it performs outstanding. The burr grinder is surprisingly good; the consistency of the extractions is great; and I never have problems frothing the milk. This is my second espresso machine and it performs so much better than my previous one (not from Breville).

I'm very glad that I got this espresso machine."
1441,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a great shot of espresso. Bottom drip tray fills up quicker than you would expect and the grinder seems to hang up more often than expected with a full hopper of beans. A quick rearranging of the coffee beans seems to fix the problem but it doesn’t seem as though that should happen as often as it does.
1442,5.0,2020-09-18, Black Sesame,We tried several other machines and brands and found out we should of started here. Have not owned very long but we are loving everything about it. We have found any problems we have had are because of our doing. We are still learning but really having fun with it. Worth paying the money for a better machine.
1443,5.0,2021-02-27, Black Sesame,"If I could give higher than a five I would. I have had this for a year and an half and use it twice or more a day. It still makes the most amazing lattes. If I have the option of ⭐️Bucks or make one my self, it’s home. We were going to SB once or twice a day so this is a huge savings in money and they taste ten times better. I highly recommend this specific machine. I love having the grinder attached. Less headache to deal with having to deal with measuring and cleaning out a separate one."
1444,5.0,2021-04-22, Black Sesame,Coffee Snobs here: We have had many expresso machines over the years. Breville is our top choice. My husband bought this one for the office so he didn't have to have a separate grinder. It is now our favorite of the Brevilles
1445,5.0,2021-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It definitely took me a number of tries to get the process down. I found watching UTube videos was more useful than reading the instructions. The most difficult aspect is steaming the milk correctly. However, once you get the ""flow"" of the entire process, it is quick and easy. One good tip I learned, which I don't think is stated in the instructions is, you need to let the machine warm up for about 20 minutes before using. I absolutely love it!"
1446,5.0,2019-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are a coffee person like me and go to Starbucks at least one a day, you are going to save a ton of money. Best investment ever! Watch one YouTube video on how to use it and now I like my late better than a properly trained barista lol true story!"
1447,5.0,2018-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"we didnt know what we were really missing. this thing is fantastic. starbucks at home with satisfaction. if you are thinking, do i really need the super automatic that does everything at one touch? no, no you don’t. that is just more stuff to clean and break. this is the machine to put a smile on your face in the morning."
1448,4.0,2019-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine. Great attention to detail and great espresso. The only con I have is that it has a high foot print. I cannot push it back on the counter under the cupboards. It is simply too high with the grinder. I am thinking of returning it but will give it few more days to see if I can live with it sticking out. If the hight is not an issue for you you cannot go wrong with this machine.
1449,3.0,2021-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"While a little daunting to use, I was so excited to get my first proper espresso machine. It worked great for a few weeks and then started leaking into the accessory tray behind the drip tray. And then under the machine itself. No matter how empty the drip tray was. After lots of online troubleshooting and reading other reviews online, I decided to cut my losses and try a different espresso maker completely."
1450,5.0,2020-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is wonderful! Just got it today and already used it 3 times. It is really easy to set up and also really easy and straight forward to use. I was a barista for a couple years but I believe the espresso tastes the same if not better than a professional espresso machine. I'm so glad that I chose to get the machine with the built in grinder, it works perfectly well and is very convenient. I used the setting 9 for my espresso beans (starbucks) and was pleased. My husband who knows nothing about making espresso can use this machine easily. The only downside is that I didn't realize the machine didn't come with the espresso shot glasses, but that is my fault for just assuming."
1451,5.0,2021-11-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took a few attempts to get the grind just right and learn how to get the milk to froth, but we now have it dialed in. Consistent grind and great tasting coffee."
1452,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve used this about everyday for 1.5 years so far. Works great every time and thing still looks brand new. I probably would have bought a cheaper model based on the price of this, my wife bought it and I’m glad she did it’s awesome"
1453,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Purchased this for my husbands bday who LOVES espresso! He is absolutely thrilled with this machine. Fabulous quality!
1454,5.0,2021-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I absolutely love this machine! It is still only a couple months old to me so it should be in tip top shape. I love the drinks I get from it!!!
1455,5.0,2019-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been using this machine for a couple months now, and I absolutely love it! I can make two espresso milk beverages faster than I can make one cup of french press coffee. Clean up is very easy in the quality is very repeatable. I highly recommend this for anybody looking to make cafe quality drinks at home."
1456,3.0,2022-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Overall the mechanics of this espresso maker seem good. But for the life of me I can't pull a flavorful shot with substantial crema. I'm no stranger to manual espresso machines. Before this I had a pretty cheap Saeco machine that was temperamental, but that i could get an espresso that had good depth of flavor. Haven't gotten there with this machine. When I pull a shot, its within the proper pressure range but just doesn't taste right to me. I'm used to an espresso flavor that makes snooty coffee shops worth going to. Smooth but with a flavor that allows you to taste the nature of the coffee. Not some bland Nespresso version. I've adjusted tamp pressure, grind, amount...and just haven't gotten there yet. I'm using Intelligencia beans on a grind setting of 5 with a single wall single serving filter pulling a double shot. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know. I don't doubt this machine has the chance to make a great cup, I just haven't found it yet."
1457,5.0,2021-06-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,If you are looking for a espresso machine look no further! amazing product! dont get the cheaper ones trust me you will regret it!
1458,5.0,2020-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use and easy to clean! One of the best coffee machines I’ve had in a while!
1459,5.0,2021-07-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A great Espresso machine that is easy to use and creates a Latte' with great crema that is better than a Starbucks. It even produces a wonderful cup of coffee using most any brand of coffee also with rich crema. We tried Starbucks Verizmo and returned it. We also tried another brand of Espresso machine and returned it. Finally we tried this Breville and it is without a doubt a 'keeper'.

I hasten to add that Breville's customer service is excellent and eager to answer any questions or guide you through a problem to a final solution.

It takes a little experimenting to get the perfect mixture for a great Latte' but experimenting is fun."
1460,1.0,2021-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After reading the reviews, and seeing the positive ratings, I wanted to buy this machine. I am so surprised how inconsistent this machine can be. The pressure gauge never goes to the region it has to be.
Why do you even care to put a pressure gauge if the machine will not behave the same when all variables stay the same? We change nothing, but pressure gauge behaves completely differently in two consecutive uses. Why do you even put a pressure gauge if this machine cannot keep it the same? I read reviews, I watched videos to learn more about the behavior. Do you have to be a chemist to use this espresso machine? Is this why iPhone is so popular, because you have to be good at adjusting the settings? I am sending this back."
1461,4.0,2019-10-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worked first time then kaput. Can't make espresso anymore. Pressure problem. THE NOTORIOUS, THE COMMON problem with this machine.

There are other issues, for example if you set the grind amount for anything more than mid level the coffee gind spill all over the cup so effectively making the grind amount useless. A design flaw.

Makes a mess making that thick black, not-espresso concoction.

Update: Gave up playing with grind size and amount. Just use the double walled cup and it makes perfect espresso."
1462,5.0,2020-11-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,It has been only a few days I started using this and I already love it. Of course not cheap. Like everything about it however need to have patience to prepare your beverage and clean the machine afterwards. Need at least a good 10-15 minutes to fully go through it to prepare it and clean. All in all looks solid. Will need to see how it will hold up. I also bought the 4 year warranty along with it. Hope I do t have to use it.
1463,5.0,2016-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this after researching the top espresso machines for personal use. We are loving it! Easy to use and makes delicious espresso shots. We did try to use coffee beans that were not specifically espresso roasted and it did not turn out well. I don’t use the steamer much but we tried it out and though it is kind of loud, it did work well. Highly recommend this for home or a small office."
1464,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Working perfectly from day 1 . Happy wife for long time , she love everyday coffe!"
1465,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really liked this machine for the past year. However, the pressure gauge just broke after one year and two months. Now my espresso has no crema at all. For the money I spent, I thought it would last at least 5 years."
1466,5.0,2021-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had this for over 6 months now and use it almost daily. It still works as well as it did the day we got it. We read the manual carefully (because that's how we roll) and follow all the instructions for use and cleaning. You have to adjust the settings usually when you buy a new coffee, but that's not a big deal. Makes really wonderful espresso, and the frother and hot water options make it easy to make a latte or long black. It's pricey, but it was absolutely worth it for us."
1467,5.0,2020-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I absolutely love my Breville Barista Express, I've been making lattes with it since it arrived!!! Definitely recommend for anyone who wants to invest in making their own specialty drinks and stop wasting time, money, and plastic on Starbucks!!! Couldn't live without this."
1468,1.0,2018-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Unusual arc for this unit. Sold to Bed Bath and Beyond in port Reading NJ from Breville CA, then to Panda Vida in Inwood NY, then to Amazon in Baltimore MD. This long journey left this as weak unit or maybe these are by design frail. In 32 days it failed with no pumping and no espresso shots. Pump was noisy from day 1. Temp was 83 c and dropped to 74 C. The cleaning did nothing as either the inline filter is blocked after using 5 stage filtered water and the heater never worked properly from the first day.

Breville customer service which is the same as gaggia, saeco and some other companies at first did not respond to chat messages, emails both of which they ask to use first. Calling them was hours on hold followed by hours to speak to a technician who never shows up and then disconnects the call.

Overall a frail unit sold repeatedly maybe due to B stock? Despite that being B stock with the non existent support pray that your machine does not break down, else you are out of $800."
1469,2.0,2019-04-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you buy this. Get a 5-year warranty. It makes great cappuccinos but will break.

I bought 2 of them. And like others have mentioned. They only last about 12-18 months.
My first one had the heating element go out. Then hose connector issues.
I sold it and picked up the new version 870/b hopping it would be better. 10 months in, no receipt the steam wand stopped working. A 4 hours of researching the fix. The part is in such high demand it out of stock everywhere.
I searched our classified and found 3 more for sale with the same issue!!
They aren’t hard to fix. But how wants to spend there time and money on that.
Maybe look at the other brands versions of this. They are the same price."
1470,5.0,2020-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,I literally love the convenience of having my own machine in my house this is sooo easy I make a latte every morning I couldn’t have picked a better machine !
1471,5.0,2020-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What can I say! When you have been driving a Fiat 500 (Delonghi) and suddenly you are cruising in a Benz, EVERYTHING IS EASY! You laugh when you clip a curb, you you sigh helplessly when you fine tune the climate control, and you throw your head back and moan when you step on the gas!

Good coffee maker!"
1472,5.0,2019-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We purchased this espresso machine on a cyber Monday deal back in 2018. I have used it almost daily to make myself lattes and my husband cappuccinos, hot and iced. This machine is predictable and consistent - producing delicious velveety espresso. Would buy again in a heart beat."
1473,5.0,2016-09-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is a bit of a learning curve, as the quality and Freshness of the beans can affect the grind. So worth it though as it produces a really delicious Espresso."
1474,5.0,2020-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the perfect home appliance. Does everything it claims to do and does it all while looking good. Tea, espresso, lates, you name it. So nice."
1475,5.0,2020-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Invest a new coffee machine to have more control over the grinds and frothing . Looks really good in the kitchen but will need to take some time to practice and make good coffer with it.
1476,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is more than I expected, as I upgraded from a lower model Breville, the flavor and quality of the espresso it produces is so much better. Add the built in grinder that works great and is so convenient, this thing is well worth the money!"
1477,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Did allot of research before deciding on this machine. Had this machine for a bit more than a month now. The only con is that it costs about 500. But if you look at the competition you'll quickly see this machine is the best performance to price and overall value. Highly recommend to those who want a fully functional machine at home, cheaper machines will fall short with poor steam wand functionality and they simply won't pull as good of shots. Verbatim: Unless you can afford a commercial machine look no further and buy this unit."
1478,5.0,2021-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've got this espresso machine as a Christmas gift from my husband. I'm in love with it!!! Very easy to use! And this is my first homemade latte! Steamer is pretty good!
1479,5.0,2018-05-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,It is very intimidating at first but makes the best coffee. I have enjoyed it so much. The only thing I hate is that it is loud. You can’t make a quiet cup 😀
1480,5.0,2021-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My husband and I are novices when it comes to espresso but after a couple of tries, we have gotten the hang of it. It is so good!!! Obviously that depends on the beans you use. :)
Have only had it 2 weeks but we like everything about it so far. Fairly easy to clean also. Definitely keep an eye out on the water level in the reservoir. We thought the pressure gauge or machine was broken but it was only out of water."
1481,5.0,2019-04-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,What a fabulous machine! I am saving $$ now making my own lattes at home 🥰👏🏼
1482,5.0,2021-03-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is our first espresso maker and we love it. It could not be easier to go from whole beans to a delicious drink in a matter of minutes.
1483,5.0,2018-12-06, Black Sesame,"Great for home use, makes excellent espresso's. Like mentioned in other reviews, it is worth your time to read the instructions BEFORE you use this product, then experiment. There is a great, and lengthy, review about what you should get in addition to this (rags, cups, etc) which is worth a read as well (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BMBVOZQEJL9E/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH9QWOU). I wish I had bought this a long time ago."
1484,5.0,2020-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This was a pretty big upgrade from my first single boiler machine. I've had it for about 2 weeks and have used it every morning. It is a great machine considering everything you get for the price.
1485,5.0,2019-06-06, Black Sesame,I put a 4 star for the easy to use because there is a bit of a learning curve to use. But not difficult at all. They more you use it the easier it is.
1486,3.0,2014-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had mine since August 2018 and it stopped working February 2021.
Like many others it just stopped pouring out pressurized coffee and was basically dripping water. It was extremely loud and vibrated more than usual.
Luckily I had the 4 year insurance and I am getting a full reimbursement in 2 days. It was good while it lasted."
1487,5.0,2020-11-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,This coffee pot is the best. The coffee is amazing and the cleanup is really easy. I would definitely recommend.
1488,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my second one. I had one a few years ago but lost it in the divorce. She got it and doesn’t even k ow how to use it. I made the best espresso martini on earth with that machine for her and all her friends. I am sure it’s collecting dust in her place now. I have another one now, wife and machine. Much better."
1489,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you buy this machine, you will eventually get it to make a decent cup of espresso. You may even get it to make a few in a row. But eventually, something will change that's outside your control, and it will stop making decent shots, and you'll have to waste more coffee and time figuring out what has changed and correcting it. A couple of mornings ago my wife and I used the machine and I pulled her shots, which were fantastic. I then reloaded the machine in the EXACT same way, and mine were terrible. You're buying a cheap machine, and it performs with cheap machine consistency. I highly recommend you save your money and buy a much nicer machine and grinder to save yourself the frustration. I'm currently drinking a crappy cup of coffee as I write this."
1490,2.0,2021-03-13, Black Sesame,"I'm giving this machine two stars because I did like it while it worked. The problem is, it worked for 6 months. To be exact, after 6 months it started making a terrible buzzing sound. Then it took two more months for it to completely stop producing espresso. It looked stylish and nice, but it's ultimately a chintzy product pretending to be of the higher quality. And to clarify: the espresso was of course used in a two-person household.

We thought, hey, we gave 600 bucks for this thing that worked for 6-8 months, but at least their customer service will be good. Eternal optimists. First you have to pass a gestapo-like examination on how you treated this machine that it broke (we made espressos, while apparently they're counting on people just letting it sit there!), and went so far as to request us to turn it on so that they can hear the buzzing over the phone. (And yes, we descaled.) Then they reluctantly (as if we were a nuisance to them) agreed to send a box for the machine so that we send it to them. This is all going on now for over two weeks and no sign of it coming back any time soon.

If you're not planning on buying a new machine every 8-12 months, skip this product. Now I'm on Amazon looking for other espresso machines, and I saw this one, so I thought it's only fair to write a review."
1491,5.0,2017-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Watch a quick video about this machine and you can say goodbye to Starbucks. This thing has already paid for itself with as many espresso drinks that we have made.
1492,5.0,2021-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine is excellent! Excellent crema every time and very easy to use. This is a great quality machine and I am very happy with it. I previously had a Delonghi Dedica 680 but it did not work well and I ended up returning it. This machine is well worth the extra money. Side note- even though it is not meant to be used with ESE pods I had some left over from my old machine and tried them in this one using the double wall, single shot filter and it works great."
1493,5.0,2021-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great product for the entry level home espresso maker!! If you can, buy through Seattle Gear, they had excellent customer service!!"
1494,5.0,2021-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I own one for each house! I wish the water was hotter. After I brew I steam it to get the espresso hotter.
1495,5.0,2019-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is so easy to use. I've had two by another manufacturer, and wish my second purchase had been this one."
1496,5.0,2017-05-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,I can not rave about this machine enough! We’ve had ours for 2 months. We use it multiple times a day and it makes a fantastic latte. We have stopped buying espresso at coffee shops because we make a better drink at home than we get elsewhere. I suggest using reverse osmosis water or water that has been highly filtered because it will make your drink taste better. This machine is well worth you money! Buy it!
1497,5.0,2021-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Definitely took a bit of a learning curve to figure this thing out, but as others have mentioned, the Breville customer service dept is great. After several attempts, I still wasn't able to get the pressure into the optimal range. The woman who helped me sounded just like the Oracle in the Matrix. She walked me through a pressure test, and then worked with me on grind fineness and amount. Hint...if you're not getting the pressure you need, stop using the razor tool to trim down your portafilter loads. The machine is very well engineered, and looks great on the counter. So far, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1498,4.0,2021-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Works great and you can adjust the grind settings, makes a great cup of espresso. Very happy with my purchase so far."
1499,5.0,2020-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use fast and easy set up even when you need to change the coarseness of the coffee.
1500,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I live it and enjoy real expresso the way I love them!!! Easy to use and to clean…
1501,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Classy, but yet easy to use!"
1502,5.0,2021-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have an expression or homemade latte in a few minutes with very low cost, and you won’t want to buy coffee in Starbucks or any other this kind of chain coffee shop anymore. The quality is equally good or even better than that, if you like you can do latte art as well!"
1503,5.0,2021-09-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This coffee blew my mind away, and trust me I am very picky and used to own many espresso machines. This machine is a work of art. Every little detail, every little tool that comes with it is top notch quality. I will return other super automatic machine i bought from gaggia and will buy one more as gift for my mom. At first i was worried about mess from handle and tapping , but boy I was wrong. No mess, big water tank easy to cleanThe coffee is amazing, super strong , smell is a killer. Highly recommended"
1504,1.0,2013-09-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Like others have stated in their reviews, the grinder stops working after awhile and it has only been 10 months. You would think that at the price point, it would last a little bit longer. The customer service appears to be non existent. I am on hold for hours before I give up on several occasions. I'm going to keep trying but seems I'm at a loss. Good luck if you purchase. I guess it's a coin flip on if you got a good unit."
1505,5.0,2021-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love it I use it everyday, the only thing is to get it the right way get coffee that is not expensive so when you adjusting it you don't use up the good stuff, but as I say I love it and my wife love it too, because it saves me a lot of money."
1506,5.0,2019-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I absolutely love my new espresso machine. Really makes you feel like a true barista to be able to grind your own beans and brew on the spot. It is my 2nd Breville appliance I have added to my kitchen and have no complaints about either one. Quality built and looks great too. Cleans up well.
1507,5.0,2021-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I ordered this machine as “used- very good” from the amazon warehouse, so the only issue that caused me frustration was that it had been preset to use more water and the shots were coming out terrible. However, after a bit of troubleshooting, it is back to factory settings and making the best espresso I have ever had!

I honestly don’t know how I could ever manage another day without this machine. If something breaks on it, I will purchase another. It is so nice to have my coffeehouse lattes at home."
1508,2.0,2020-11-09, Black Sesame,"I purposely decided to wait to post my review so I can have a clear understanding of how the machine works and go through all my test phases now that I've had this machine for a long time here is my review.
The machine work perfectly when new after the first two months of usage when I would start to steam my milk hot water would start to pour out of the cup filler located directly in front of the steaming wand.. other than that the machine works great again all the way up until about the fourth month another issue every time I pulled the portafilter body to empty the portafilter basket the basket stays stuck inside of the machine so I'm forced to use my fingers which most of the time it burns my fingers so I have to wait but when I'm in a rush it's a pretty big hassle especially when it's Non-Stop I hope this can be rectified. The machines grinder works wonderfully it is not always precise even if you leave it on the same setting it will never give you the same amount of beans but that's just due to the hopper of how clean you keep it and how much volume of beans is inside the hopper helping it along into the grinder.
I would like to give this machine in a 5-star rating and I would love to change my review."
1509,5.0,2019-08-29, Black Sesame,The first one I ordered was defective and I got it replaced. The replacement is perfect! Perfect grind and perfect pull! Love this machine!
1510,5.0,2019-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent product
1511,5.0,2019-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this product. The clean up is tedious but I have not been to Starbucks since this purchase! Worth the money, in my opinion!"
1512,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this for my boyfriend. I am hardly knowledgeable about coffee, but he is and has enjoyed using it so much. It makes such a difference—the cheap ones don’t even compare. There is a learning curve if you know nothing like me, but tons of videos on YouTube to help."
1513,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,My last Breville lasted about 8 yrs and when it finally gave out I bought the same model again! I highly recommend this product!
1514,2.0,2020-08-01, Black Sesame,"No water to the steam wand or hot water, instead water leaks through the Group head. I am just outside of warranty and I am not spending $150-$200 for reconditioning.

This was a great unit for 2 years. It is unfortunate to spend this much money for a product that consistently does not hold up.

I speculate that all the great reviews are folks who have not made it very far into the life of their unit."
1515,5.0,2020-08-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have really enjoyed using the Breville Barista Express! Very high quality machine which is also easy to use, even for a novice like me. Within a few days, I was able to make most of the expressos and lattes I would normally buy from Starbucks."
1516,5.0,2018-12-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was a great choice to purchase. Not something I had to have, but wanted. I totally love my coffee every morning."
1517,5.0,2017-08-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine! While it may be a it like a science experiment getting the right grind and tamp, once you do you can enjoy delicious home brewed coffee anytime you want!"
1518,5.0,2018-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This has replaced our morning pour-over and bottled iced-coffee. We could not be happier with the product. One month in and we've used it daily with no issues. It took an hour or so of experimenting with the different settings to get the flavor we prefer, but now that we know what we like it is consistent each time.
While pricey it does work well and the coffee tastes great."
1519,5.0,2017-07-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After just a few practice runs, I’m now making the best latte and cappuccino ever! I’m so pleased with this machine. It is not hard to use. So glad I spent the money for this quality coffee machine!"
1520,1.0,2019-07-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Than ever buy a product from Breville again.

No seriously, never mind that I am on my 3rd unit, and that Breville has zero support (zilch, zero, nada... Won't even answer the phone let alone respond to multiple emails begging them to support their $500 boat anchor.), and never mind that 2 of the machine required extensive recalibration before a proper grind could be achieved, but all 3 have died after roughly 75 to 100 shots. No lights, no hum no power at all.

And all 3 died right after roughly 30 to 60 days had passed insuring that a return was impossible without contacting Breville directly, who doesn't answer at all.

Only the first unit ever produced a proper shot (after much tinkering) the second couldn't grind fine enough even at the finest setting and after adjusting the burrs internally according to the instructions. The 3rd wouldn't grind course enough despite setting to maximum courses and also adjusting internally. Such extreme inconsistencies between machines has me wondering if it was assembled by a team of hopped up kittens under the watchful tutelage of an opioid addicted penguin distracted by a midget clown on a unicycle juggling chainsaws.

Yes I checked my power supply, even metered it. No you can't take the unit apart to check or swap a fuse without removing at least 15 screws (right about where I gave up on the 3rd unit when trying desperately to fix it myself due to the extreme lack of response by the above-mentioned kitten circus.

Did I mention Breville has zero customer support?

1521,5.0,2018-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love lattes and this machine does the job if used properly 👌
1522,5.0,2014-03-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,This marvelous machine has added a significant bit of graciousness during the Covid lockdown. Excellent industrial design (utility meets style - great design!) makes delicious espresso drinks. Has already paid for itself. Support your local bean roaster!!!
1523,3.0,2020-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased one of these and had the pressurized espresso making part of the machine fail on me after it had been making really loud noises for about a month. The machine worked pretty well until it failed after two years of use.

I then purchased a second one and used it for another two years before the grinder failed on me. I took it apart and cleaned very thoroughly before putting it carefully back together, but no luck. These machines are nice, but too pricey to replace every 2 years."
1524,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far, the Barrista exactly what it needs to do. We’ve used it every day for two months ( as long as we’ve had the machine)"
1525,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Before XMAS, $699, after XMAS $599, after New Years' $699. It's a regular roller coaster, wait for the $599 price to come back. This is a terrible practice."
1526,5.0,2020-01-16, Black Sesame,My father in law was over seas for a couple weeks and came home wanting lattes instead of drip coffee. This was a birthday gift from all of us and he loves it. At first he was concerned the pressure wasn't registering but then we read a few reviews and saw that it needs to be tamped down and not shaved and it started working just as expected! We will see him again this weekend and I cannot wait to have a fresh latte!
1527,5.0,2020-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought one for my personal use about one year ago and have found it to be a good machine for its price class.

I bought this one for a friend as a Christmas gift. So far, he hasn't thrown it through my window so, I would guess he is very pleased with it."
1528,5.0,2014-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Two weeks in and I’m impressed. This makes a great shot of espresso. The steam wand isn’t as powerful as a commercial machine but it does a good job and I can get a nice smooth drink made.
Really happy with the purchase so far."
1529,5.0,2017-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great espresso machine.
Incorporated grinder is an awesome feature.
After learning few tricks, easy to use.
Remember to refill water container often, especially after using milk frother.
Makes delicious coffees every time."
1530,4.0,2019-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far so good. Got the machine set up, flushed and calibrated. The instructions were pretty straight forward. Now I am on the learning curve. Getting everything set for my taste and finding the beans for me. There are some great reviews on this product with wonderful tips. Find them and read them. Very helpful as well. The only downside, it could turn into an addiction."
1531,5.0,2019-10-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For the price, this is a great, great machine. My cappuccinos improved tremendously with this machine and I find the grinder to be very decent and consistent. Its industrial design cannot be argued with as it makes a stand-out impression on my countertop. It looks as impressive as its coffee is terrific. My shots have become more consistent (although not perfectly so) and, with a great coffee like Koffee Kult Dark Roast, I can now say that I make better coffee than both Starbucks and Peet's. It just works and does so well."
1532,5.0,2020-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm no espresso snob, but I have to say this machine is amazing. It has everything I could think of, it's easy to use, and it looks beautiful. It comes with 4 filters, Single/Double Shots and then a Dual Wall Single/Double Shots (The Dual wall one is perfect when switching beans and you don't want to mess with the settings to find the right pressure).

I highly highly highly recommend this for anyone starting to get into Espresso making and doesn't want to spend a fortune. This will make an amazing coffee and has all the bells and whistles you could need to start out."
1533,5.0,2020-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought used which was fine, but I didn’t get the instruction manual. Would have been helpful to have that"
1534,5.0,2018-10-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This unit is the perfect blend of automation and manual effort. It still requires you to know a bit about pulling a snot, getting the freshest roasted coffee (should be within two weeks since roasting), setting the volume and grind, and getting the right tamp. I love it - it’s so convenient to make great espresso at home!!"
1535,5.0,2021-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best machine EVER! IVE literally had mine for 7 years and it's never given me a single problem.
1536,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Took a bit to get the pressure right, but that issue has been resolved though a lot of practice. Wish we could steam milk while pulling shots, but for this price range you can't have everything."
1537,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes great coffee, just takes a little extra time to clean. Glad I got it. Worth the trouble of cleaning it"
1538,5.0,2021-05-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a very high quality machine. Makes delicious lattes. Grinds and brews perfectly! Easy and fun to use. Also the smooth beautiful stainless steel adds an elegant flare and looks beautiful on the countertop :)
1539,4.0,2016-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have had the machine for 3 weeks now. Love the espresso. Still learning the different ways to adjust and make different drinks. It is unfortunate that the machine is pretty noisy. I like to get up early and get my morning started but feel bad about making so much noise and possibly waking my spouse or guests in our home.
1540,2.0,2019-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Was very happy with this espresso machine until it stopped producing steam from the wand after about 6 months. Went through multiple cleaning and descaling operations but eventually had to send it back to Breville for repair. For a machine that’s $600+ you’d expect it to last without issues. I contacted Breville about the warranty and had to ship it to their facility for repair which is great, but now I’m without an espresso machine for the next few weeks (my caffeine addicts out there know this is going to be painful). Not happy with the lasting quality but when it worked it was a game changer to my previously $5/day latte habit."
1541,3.0,2020-10-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Took a couple days to get the right brew but once we did- it was perfect! 17 months after purchase- it doesn’t brew. I’ve tried cleaning it multiple times and unplugging it and plugging it back in. This item is way too expensive to be counter trash. I bought a percolator since we need coffee. It works great for multiple cups, but not when you just want one. We miss our espresso machine."
1542,5.0,2020-07-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my second Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine - my original one is in Maine awaiting my return. This new one is just as dependable as the original with a couple of improvements. First, the bean hopper is larger with more sloping sides that makes the beans slide more easily into the grinder. With my older machine there is occasionally a hang up from hopper to grinder. Second improvement is the fact that you can now have hot water from the steam wand. Kind of handy, too."
1543,5.0,2021-07-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I did an embarrassing amount of research on these products. Save yourself a lot of time and just purchase this one. It is THE BEST and I highly recommend it!
1544,5.0,2021-02-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We are obsessed!!!! I buy other cappuccino’s from restaurants/drive-throughs and bring them home and compare them to the ones I can make with my machine...mine wins every time!!!! Forget expensive coffee, this is where the good coffee is at! Easy to use and amazing results. I use it every day. Sometimes twice a day!!"
1545,5.0,2019-02-21, Black Sesame,"Next month will be 5 years since I received this espresso machine! Still works great. Yes, it take some experimenting with the settings at the beginning to get the espresso just right for you - so much so that my husband called it my ""science experiment"". I clean it every 3 months or so... I only use RO water in it and still descale it twice a year. Several times a year I take the grinder apart and clean it."
1546,5.0,2018-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"One you learn how to use it, and how to dial in the grind, you get really good espresso. Mine has worked well for 4 years. I use it sometimes two and three times a day making both espresso and milk based drinks. It’s a great starter machine."
1547,5.0,2021-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,This product is just what I wanted I love it and use it every day. My kids love hot chocolate and chi tea made with it.
1548,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Okay, so, it's expensive. Let me tell you, having bought (and returned) the budget model from Breville, ANYONE can make a decent espresso drink with this machine. We don't do much dairy, and a concern has been getting coconut and almond milk to 'froth,' as well as pulling a good shot of espresso through the darn thing.... It totally lives up to expectations. I made like 30 lattes in the first weekend we had it, just experimenting. It's a really, really good machine. 10/10."
1549,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have wanted this machine for years! Finally got it, and I have no regrets. I save money on coffee and its fun to be my own barista every morning!"
1550,5.0,2016-11-14, Black Sesame,"This a well- designed, well- built piece of machinery, with easy to read and easy to follow instructions, regarding which I have the following observations: what is 30 pounds pressure for tamping? the pressure to squeeze a grape, an orange? Also on the topic of tamping, are the instructions saying that if you do it wrong the first time, it is best to continue doing it wrong.
The machine could be improved by including an easy to read water tank gage at the front of the machine. Breville BES870XL Barista Express Espresso Machine
I will continue to practice with the one cup cycle exclusively, until I get something almost as good as a Brazilian cafesihno or a Cuban Calle Ocho cafe.
Thank you Breville, thank you Amazon!"
1551,5.0,2017-11-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My only regret is why I didn't get it earlier! Real espresso experience. Easy to use, plug and drink."
1552,5.0,2020-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love it, but its not super user friendly. Didn't realize I had to put the filter strainer in, yes it went all over the place when pressure was added. I should say its not beginner friendly, but we worked through it and use it daily. Took a bit to do the first cleaning, I am sure it will be much easier in the future. I have not attempted temperature control yet. Scared to try."
1553,5.0,2020-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes wonderful espresso/lattes. We use it daily, and have dialed in to our perfect espresso grind. Love being a barista at home."
1554,5.0,2021-07-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is obviously a product for serious espresso style drinkers, but so far we think it's great. My wife likes cafe latte, and the milk steaming is great for her. I generally have an ""Americano"", adding water to the espresso, but it does make better coffee than any other I've had. The device has multiple options and is somewhat labor intensive, so you should decide if you're up for that amount of effort for your coffee. Because there are so many variables, you can fine-tune your espresso to your taste. And it's a beautiful machine. I can't comment on reliability since we've only had the Breville for about a month."
1555,5.0,2017-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,i love this machine. working from home demanded an upgrade from drip coffee. This is just right.
1556,5.0,2019-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel, It’s worth every penny…just do it!
1557,5.0,2018-09-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are ready to make coffee like the pros do, this is what you need. This was well worth the investment. After our office got one of these and we all learned how to make espressos I had to get one. Glad I did!"
1558,5.0,2017-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love it! It makes such great espresso. It is easy to use. The grinder is really good. I also have a Nespresso that I like, but its espresso cannot be compared to the espresso I can make with my Breville."
1559,5.0,2021-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really have been enjoying our espresso's in the morning. As total barista novices, there is a bit of a technique learning curve to make the perfect cup. But that is operator error, not machine error. When we nail the technique, a professional barista couldn't do better.

We are so glad we got the one with the grinder attached. The grinder works well.

We are very pleased with our purchase."
1560,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Performs as expected, easy to operate.
I've experienced minimal clean-up as compared to some of the reviews.
Anything worth doing is worth doing well."
1561,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this about 2 months. I use it every day. Sometimes more than once. It took some experimenting to get the grind and amount right, but now it makes perfect espresso and steamed milk every time. YouTube helps a lot with learning to properly froth the milk for lattes. It has already paid for itself as I would spend a lot on drinks and food at the coffee shop each week. It is high quality equipment. Would highly recommended."
1562,4.0,2020-12-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nice Espresso machine for the price
1563,5.0,2021-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's been great so far. I'm a complete beginner and this was my first attempt at espresso making. It only took a few tries to get it right. I wish it came with a few more recipes or tips to make different drinks, but a luckily there are plenty of online videos how. It was intimidating at first but i love it now. Only complaint is that it is barely barely too tall to slide under my top cabinet on the countertop."
1564,5.0,2020-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product but there is a learning curve. Once you figure it out then it’s delicious espresso all the time. It’s good for mornings but not instant. Takes maybe 1 - 2 minutes. The water isn’t piping hot but can nuke it. I add a little boiling water from a tea kettle.
1565,5.0,2019-05-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Didn’t know how much we NEEDED espresso until we had this. Best investment ever.
1566,5.0,2020-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After getting comfortable and knowing how to use this machine properly, it’s extremely fun to use and makes awesome coffee drinks!"
1567,5.0,2019-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I truly enjoy having the built in cone grinder. Freshly ground espresso beans step up the flavor. This is the first unit I have owned with so many ways to customize your brew. There is absolutely no excuse for a poor draw with this unit. The unit is reliable, delivers consistently, and looks great on the countertop. I would love to have one in my office!"
1568,2.0,2020-12-05, Black Sesame,"This was great for almost exactly 3 months.

At the 3 month mark the filter basket clogged ($35 for a new one). A few days later the brewing mechanism would no longer mate with the machine and I had to flip it over and tighten the fittings in that assembly manually so it would work again.

Not acceptable for a device with this price tag."
1569,5.0,2020-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We’ve had this espresso machine for almost two years now, and it has performed consistently and flawlessly. The quality of both the machine and what comes out of it rival that of much more expensive options. If you are looking to make cafe-quality espresso at home (and I don’t mean Starbucks), get this and you will not regret it."
1570,5.0,2021-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I haven't visited a coffee shop once since I got this. Of course they're all probably closed right now because of the world pandemic and all that, but even if they were open I wouldn't be paying $4 for an Americano any longer.
Great product."
1571,1.0,2019-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this hoping for a true level of café quality, but was sorely disappointed. While the incorporated grinder is a bonus, it over-doses on the double-shot filter size (a common complaint as others have noted).

I was especially disappointed with two things - the sloppiness of the shot extraction and the steam wand. Once I was able to dial in the correct tamping, the machine quite literally 'spit' out the espresso from the spout. The machine and I were splattered with hot espresso, with probably 1/3 of the extracted shot winding up everywhere except the shot glass or mug being dispensed into, while the pump put off an unsettling pulsating whine. No matter what adjustments were tried, including grind fineness to dosing and tamping pressure, this problem persisted. I've worked with machines from under $100 to those costing upwards of $10k, and I've never had a machine 'spit' like this one did. A sign of sloppy quality control that left me wondering what other essential things were overlooked.

Secondly, the steam wand is, well...pathetic. There is only one tiny pin hole at the end. Sure, it can produce decently velvetized milk. The problem is that it takes upwards of 60 seconds to get the milk foamed and up to temperature. By that time, all the lovely crema on your espresso will have vanished.

All the gadgets, bells and whistles on this machine can't overcome the serious flaws in design and production inherent in this machine. You can get way better quality from machines for half the cost."
1572,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So excited to have this beautiful machine in my house to make cappuccinos and lattes! Relatively easy to use and makes excellent espresso! I waited a long time to buy it and now that I have it, I am so mad at myself for waiting all this time!"
1573,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my 2nd Breville Espresso (87OXL) machine in the last 2 1/2 years. After reading the various reviews on durability and customer service I was reluctant to buy our original machine; more so for the 2nd unit. My 1st machine lasted pretty close to the posted reviews before an internal value broke. I called several local espresso repair shops who advised that replacement parts and repairs are controlled and must be done by Breville. Breville's policy is to recondition units for around $200 bucks and return them if out of warranty. The reconditioned units have various problems when returned (note other reviews). So why spend $600 bucks on a poorly designed machine with limited durability? Pure math! My wife and I drink 2-3 lattes a day ($8-$12.00) x 365 days = $4000+/yr. When the unit works it provides great coffee. You have to play with the grind/amount settings as you try different beans, but after a couple trys you get a great brew. However, Breville needs to take note of growing number of customer complaints. The number of negative reviews is significant and real. You would hope for reputation sake they would address their design issues, and poor customer service."
1574,5.0,2019-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,He looks forward to making lattes for us both every morning - this machine truly brews some magnificent tasting cappuccinos/lattes! :D
1575,5.0,2019-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best purchase I ever made
1576,5.0,2019-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a great home machine and the support was extremely helpful as well as informative. Easy to fill and clean. Fun mastering the foam art. Due to the cost of these machines you have to do your research and after I did this was the right choice for me.
1577,5.0,2020-02-05, Black Sesame,I love this machine! You need to have patience and understand that you MUST adjust the grind and your tamping pressure to get amazing drinks. To put in perspective our first pound through the machine was Starbucks Espresso beans. My wife and I both have the opinion it tastes better and two shots out of this is just as potent as a triple or quad at Starbucks. It will pay for itself in 45 days for us and then it is all savings!
1578,5.0,2019-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was received on time and in great condition. Very well packaged. Our family have as I write this, two months experience with this machine. All has been good. There is a learning curve for correct pressure of the coffee compression but it’s quick with feedback from the pressure gauge."
1579,5.0,2020-01-05, Black Sesame,"I’m glad that I bought it. It totally changed my life. I no longer go to starbucks because this machine gives me much better quality coffee. Every morning, your kitchen will be full of fresh coffee scent and you won’t need something to remove fridge smell. The only downside is that you’ll end up drinking too much coffee everyday. But that’s what we live for.

If you are a coffee lover, don’t waste your time. Just buy this machine."
1580,3.0,2020-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is just ok for an espresso machine. If, for instance, the felt washer that is part of the grinding mechanism disintegrates (which it has twice in two years) it's almost impossible to find another one. Breville says they're backordered for weeks. They recommend you not make your own because the size and texture have to be exact. The grinder is a weak point of this system, and next time I'll probably go with something else."
1581,2.0,2019-05-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought it thinking it will last me 5 years, but it lasted only a month. Happens i guess. The reason for me to write this review is a poor customer service. After shipping the unit no one reached out with updates. After a first follow up call, i was told to reply to an email in few days. No one responded to my email. Called them again and received an update that repairs will take 7-14 days due to high volume. Why would you not communicate this if you are having delays in service? BTW i loved the coffee machine while it worked. I hope it's serviced with revised components that actually solve the problem so i wont need to go through this again. Reminder, this thing is $700"
1582,5.0,2018-01-21, Black Sesame,Our whole family can make a latte anytime during the day. Saving us $$$ on coffee shops and we can customize ourselves. Great investment.
1583,5.0,2017-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,If it would allow I would give this item a ten stars I would. It makes an amazing espresso and with a little practice and the right beans you will be able to make drinks as good as your local coffee shop. Please do not hesitate to get this espresso maker if you are considering one to purchase.
1584,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are already into coffee, this machine can help you not only with making espressos and cappuccinos but rather with understand of every stage and its importance. I can learn how to easily avoid major mistakes in coffee making. You will enjoy yourself and make a better coffee than in any famous coffee chain."
1585,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am writing this as a warning to all. I purchased this as an "" out of the box warehouse"" listed as just having cosmetic damage on the box.
it turned out it was missing one the accessories. I tried calling breville and they refused to resend - saying they had no obligation because there was no warranty .
it seems I am stuck -- fortunately it was not a crucial component - but I am warning everyone else that this could be an issue"
1586,5.0,2021-06-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,This was a great purchase! It makes a great cup of coffee. Easy to use. Easy to clean. We have been using it for about 3 months and have not had one issue. Plus it has paid for itself as we eliminated our $200/month Starbucks habit.
1587,5.0,2014-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,This replaced our every day coffee maker in our real estate office. Once the correct grounds are discovered for the beans the brew is exceptional. It took a bit (and a couple pounds of beans) to get the correct grind but the time spent was worth it. I'm happy to have this product.
1588,5.0,2020-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,I decided to buy this after spending a week in Spain and drinking the most amazing coffee/espresso ever. I wanted to be able to treat myself to that same experience at home. I could not be happier. I make 2-3 cappuccino’s a day and it never fails to deliver perfect espresso every time!
1589,5.0,2019-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this for almost 3 years and use it daily. It was a bit hard to justify the price upfront but consider this: If you make one latte a day vs the $4 you spend at a coffee shop daily, it will pay itself off in 5 months. Buying coffee beans in bulk helps too!

It still works perfectly and is super easy to clean. I wash out the tray every few days and it's all dishwasher safe. Super heavy duty product and the milk steams very quickly."
1590,4.0,2018-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Too noisy
1591,5.0,2020-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes a wonderful coffee, but you need to definitely learn how to use this machine properly otherwise you will fail big time. Thank goodness for youtobe ☺️ Quite noisy. The coffee is thick and flavorful, my husband enjoys it very much, i am definitely afraid to use it because I don’t want to mess up the settings 🤷🏻‍♀️."
1592,5.0,2020-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The build quality, fit and finish is second to none. Espresso, Cappacinno and Latte qualities are as good or better than the coffee shops (provided the beans, machine settings and your technique are correct). I use Lavazza Super Creme, set grind at 4, quantity at 3’ o’clock and tamp around 25-30 lbs.
This thing rocks.

My only hope is that it lasts.

Bye the way, I had a few questions and called customer service. That too is above board."
1593,5.0,2021-08-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best Espresso machine I have ever owned. I personally did not find it as difficult to set up the correct settings before getting a good espresso within the Breville specified range. Go online and look at some videos on maintenance, care and getting a good espresso. Even though expensive compared to what we find within the normal range of less than $150, this is by far the best investment you will make it you drink at least one cup of coffee a day. Highly recommended."
1594,1.0,2021-05-19, Black Sesame,"Makes great shots, loved the commercial components, feels like I'm making coffee like a barista/baristo again, this machine is really fun and easy. Loved that it came with everything you need to make that buzz. This machine is awesome for the first 1.5 years. The problem was that the water pump went out. We ordered a pump to try and fix/replace ourselves. You need more than regular tools that you have. So we gave up and cannot return the new water pump. The grinder works. So we've been frenchpressing. We miss espresso shots. I'm hoping we bought a dud because I still look periodically to see if the price went down enough to temp us to buy again. For the 1.5 years it was working, we did drink our espresso fill and got our money's worth but disappointed ours did not last long. We made 1 espresso everyday, cleaned it after every use. Some days we used it more than once a day. Idk I hate leaving this bad review because 1.5 years of espresso is worth the money we bought it for, cause let's face it...espresso is a luxury, but wished it would have lasted longer."
1595,5.0,2021-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,My wife says I love coffee more than her. I chose not to correct her. Love this machine.
1596,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Great product, nothing to complain so far.
I use it everyday now, and totally abandoned Starbucks, saved some money and time wasted in the drive thru.
Also, it will take sometime until you can make good coffees, take time to practice."
1597,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love everything about this machine. I upgraded from a Breville Cafe Roma. Wish I would of upgraded years ago. Love the grinding feature and it pulls a great espresso shot after you get it dialed in to your preference.
1598,4.0,2020-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have only had it for a few weeks, but I love it so far... The integrated grinder is really handy and fresh ground = awesome flavor. Really like the tool stash spot and the easy to clean tray. But,,,
Wish it had a low water indicator (it is a bummer to run out of water midway through an extraction), also really need to let the steam wand run for a while because it discharges a lot of water at first. Hot water ""tap"" splashes a lot."
1599,5.0,2019-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worth every penny. This does a great job. It helps to use the best coffee you can find. I highly recommend this to everyone. We drink a lot of coffee in our house and this is perfect for our family. It does take a few attempts to dial it in if you are trying a different type of coffee beans. This can waste a few beans in the process but once you get it set you are good to go.

The user manual is VERY helpful and can walk you though how to get better shots.

Very happy."
1600,5.0,2018-03-27, Black Sesame,Scared to spend this much money but it’s delicious. I Thoroughly enjoy the machine get decent flavor and it’s not terribly hard to use on the downside it is a real pain in the rump to consistently clean
1601,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! Produces great coffee. I've had it for 6 months now and I cannot find anything bad about this product. Great grinder and milk steamer as well
1602,3.0,2015-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Everything works well, but, this thing is soooo loud. Your household will be awake after the first person starts to brew... for $800 i would expect better control over the machinery vibrations."
1603,5.0,2016-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fresh ground beans with every cup. What a way to start my day. So far I have only made espresso and lattes. Kind of messy with the grinding but not excessive for all it does. Makes super great coffee. I now make my own instead of going to Starbucks.
1604,5.0,2019-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Omg I love it!! I thought it was going to be a lot harder to learn how to pull good shots but it wasn’t bad at all. I read the manual and watched some videos and they were tasty right from the beginning.
1605,5.0,2019-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,I don’t use my French Press anymore.
1606,5.0,2021-04-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This thing is so cool. I watched it on Amazon for almost a year and finally caught it around $480 and pulled the trigger this time last year. It gets a little finicky at times but you’ll learn it’s behavior. I’m overall really pleased with it. It’s fun to use, makes good coffee and you get to save money previously wasted on a $5 cup of overbrewed joe in a white and green recycled cups."
1607,5.0,2020-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was debating a lot to order this thing due to some of the reviews but I decided to pull the trigger. Once it came in I kept the box for a while just in case I needed to send it back. I have no idea why people had issues this thing is amazing... yes it is plastic... so what, just keep it clean! I use this amazing machine every day and have no issues. Not sure what the negative reviewers want for $400 bucks... I'm sure they were expecting the machine from Starbucks."
1608,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"i don’t know how you mess this up but i purchased this as a new product and it came in literally 10 minutes and i opened and seen no box and see marks and scratches all over the machine this unacceptable, nobody purchase this machine from breville"
1609,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine makes really tasty coffee. It took a couple of rounds to get the hang of the settings, but it’s not difficult at all even for a novice. There is definitely some consistent cleaning required, which is to be expected. Overall I’m really happy with it."
1610,5.0,2014-04-29, Black Sesame,"The Barista Espresso Machine is the best Christmas gift that I can ever received. I love it, can’t go back with other coffee machine."
1611,5.0,2021-06-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this one as a gift for my daughter and her husband. I own one two and love it! I was tired of going to the coffee shop every day and my americano tasting different, plus spending $15-20 daily! I had never made espresso shots before but I watched YouTube videos and now my americanos taste great and most importantly, they taste the same everyday! I bought mine last October and have saved so much $$$$$$!"
1612,5.0,2014-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this Breville espresso machine for 4 years, I make my coffee 7 days a week morning and afternoon for my wife and until now it has worked wonderful, when I have guests at home I make them a cappuccino and they say it is better than the one from starbucks."
1613,5.0,2019-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine so much. I would recommend watching a lot of YouTube and read the booklet it comes with. It is quite loud, but that’s any espresso machine."
1614,5.0,2014-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Completed a significant amount of research on the espresso machine we wanted and this was the clear winner (in this price point). Very nicely designed machine (both looks great and functional). It takes some effort and understanding to learn how to pull a good shot and get the milk right, so if you don't want to be bothered purchase a super automatic. Overall excited about the purchase a month in."
1615,3.0,2019-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine for several years (june 2013) and it is great...The problem is the washer (54MM steam ring) which seals the basket to the machine wears out after a few years. The company has told me several times in the last two months that the rings would be in in 2 weeks. It has become clear that they have no idea if they will ever get the replacement part. Customer service is now offering to charge me to send in the machine and have it serviced...not cool. This is a part which takes 5min to replace, so i should not have to be without my machine. I am going to ask them to send me a new/different model for which they have replacement parts...Will update what happens.
They did eventually send me the part."
1616,5.0,2021-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,OMG!!! I love love love this latte maker! I’m never going back to a coffee shop unless I’m traveling!! Now I need to learn latte art!
1617,4.0,2021-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love how this works but it does take time. The quality of the espresso is great once you get the machine dialed in correctly for your elevation, season, type of coffee and roast of coffee. The machine is LARGE which makes it hard to store it on the counter top as it doesn't really fit under the upper cabinets."
1618,5.0,2018-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best machine for home. It comes with every thing that you will need to make a quality home espresso and beyond
1619,4.0,2016-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this espresso machine! Saving me so much money (I used to stop at starbucks daily)

Pros: easy to use! makes great coffee!

Cons: messy.....

also DO NOT forget the filter.... I did and I blew coffee all over my kitchen!"
1620,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine. We're beginners, but can easily make some of our favorite drinks right away. This machine has an automatic function for newbies, but more expert baristas can grind to their own specifications as well. The ""Razor"" tool is genius."
1621,4.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,We are loving this. Purchased for husband for Father's Day. Great addition to our kitchen.
1622,5.0,2020-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The blending power is very good, it is relatively easy to use and it is very easy to clean."
1623,5.0,2021-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"price for this is SO much better than comparable machines and the results are outstanding. Had my last one for 18 years. The quality is top notch. works fast, adjustments are simple, and many options are available for your brewing taste. We love this machine."
1624,5.0,2021-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Nice little espresso machine. Easy to setup and use. Coming from an Breville Oracle, only drawback is you have to tamp it yourself and it does waste a little more coffee grinds in the process. I said drawback, not complaint, since I knew that and plus the price was way less expensive than the Breville Oracle. Nice little machine though."
1625,5.0,2019-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Birthday gift
1626,5.0,2021-05-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this for my mom for Mother’s Day and we will never go back to drinking dirt water coffee. We aren’t ones to splurge on an item.. this was not cheap by any means, but it’s sooooo worth it!"
1627,5.0,2021-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,It been 18 months since I got this machine. It is used multiple times a day everyday. This is a well designed product. It’s very easy to tune and delivers great espresso. So far it has been very reliable for us. I have not had any issue with it.
1628,5.0,2020-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is worth every penny. I make Americanos daily and they taste better than Starbucks. Love it.
1629,5.0,2019-11-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,we love this machine so much. We make 4+ espresso drinks a day and this has not let us down once. The only thing I wish we could add is a more adjustable steamer wand so that you could adjust the power of the wand. Other than that this machine is perfect!
1630,5.0,2017-04-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Obsessed with this machine! This is our 3rd Espresso machine and it blows the others out of the water! It is SO fast and makes the most delicious coffees! We also purchased the Lavazza beans from amazon to go along with it and we are obsessed. I was a starbucks a day girl and I have only gone 1 time since purchasing this machine and that was only because I couldnt have mine at the time!
1631,5.0,2021-05-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have had mine for about 6 months and I LOVE it!! I had never made an espresso before I bought this item. It was a process getting the grind size and water amount for the proper espresso BUT once I got everything set up properly.....has worked perfect ever since!
1632,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,This machine makes great espresso (and coffee). I was deciding between this model that grinds the coffee or the slightly less expensive model and I am so glad that I went with the upgraded model. It is easy to use and clean. I use it several times a day and have had it since July.
1633,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been making two lattes a day for 20 years. This is my 4th machine and it's more automated than the ones I've had in the past. But so far, it's doing great. I love the built in grinder, magnetic tamper holder and steaming wand. It's also super easy to clean. I'm still getting used to the espresso shots (programming volume) as my prior machines did not have a set cup amount and the Breville settings seem skimpy. As a bonus, it's simply beautiful sitting on my counter."
1634,5.0,2019-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best in the business! This machine is amazing for at home lattes and espresso. The grinder allows for extreme precision
1635,5.0,2020-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife and I were buying 7-14 quad shot espresso drinks per week (lattes, americanos, macchiatos, cortados, etc). We bought this because it makes hipster-shop-quality coffee, and we made our money back in cost savings in less than six months. We've had some issues with oily beans but our preference is African light-roast coffee anyway. We use it every morning and my wife uses it with ease, and she is not someone who has a high aptitude for gadgets."
1636,5.0,2021-07-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Once you know how to work this it is so easy. I took the advise of one of the previous reviewers and it was spot on. I also watched a iTunes video on descaling and it was also easy. Love my espresso machine!
1637,5.0,2019-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Simple to use. Easy to clean. Once you figure out grind size and amount your off and running. The machine looks nice as well. Very nice to have one of these machines as a shelter in place partner.
1638,5.0,2016-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this thing. It took me a while to figure out how fine to grind the beans and the automatic dosing just makes a mess. I just grind a little, tamp it down, top it off, then tamp it again. It makes amazing lattes. Life changer!"
1639,5.0,2021-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wow what can I say, i only had this for one day. Had to adjust the grind to hit espresso level and used lots of coffee beans to test out. All in all, the final setup is great! The cappuccino tastes just like Starbucks. I no longer need to stop there as a morning routine!!!"
1640,5.0,2020-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This Espresso machine is awesome good quality easy to use make amazing coffee. On thing I really like about it and no one really said anything about is there is a spout on the side that puts out boiling water so makes it nice to make hot chocolate with out having to boil water. I definitely think you wouldn't be disappointed if you buy this espresso machine it has a lot of features
1641,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,We LOVE this coffee machine ! What a difference grinding means and making your own coffee than using ground coffee and hot water
1642,5.0,2016-07-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve had this for 3 years now. Used 2x or 3x per day without issue. I clean it regularly and use the water filters too. For home use it’s been fabulous. Lots of videos on YouTube if you want to learn more too.
1643,5.0,2019-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’m from Seattle but moved to Florida. There just isn’t coffee here like there is in Seattle. So my husband and I bought this so we can make our own drinks. The machine is WONDERFUL. We’ve had it for about 4 months now and we use it multiple times a day. I would recommend this machine to ANYBODY who is looking for a good machine to have at home! Love it!
1644,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,The Best Buy and best Expresso machine on the market. We have two. I like that it can be programmed and manually used at same time. No problems after 5 years. I highly recommend it. It makes delicious coffee however you like it.
1645,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am in love!!
I now make my own drinks and they are as good as my favorite coffee shop. I can’t recommend this enough. I watched a few videos and I’m basically a pro. 😂"
1646,5.0,2017-04-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this for my sister and her husband as a home-warming gift.
1647,5.0,2020-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Like everything except the fact that it only has a single boiler. Wish we would hate gotten the double boiler.
1648,5.0,2020-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine has been great so far. I am not a novice barista but this has been a struggle. It is amazing how much the end product is affected by grind of the coffee, amount of the coffee, how hard you tamp it...lots of variations. But after a month now I have it pretty well dialed in and the espresso you get is always at least very good to very very good!!"
1649,5.0,2019-07-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Impressive how well this machine performed straight out of the box. We made very nice cappuccinos one day and lattes the next day. Super simple to set up and instructions outline the process and techniques to get just right. I should have bought one much sooner.
1650,5.0,2019-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"At first I felt like the steamer wand was kind of short, but it’s basically the perfect size for the steaming wand it comes with. It’s a great machine and make delicious espressos. There are so many bells and whistles that it will still take me a while to figure it all out. For now, I can make delicious lattes and cappuccinos. You get what you pay for here. It’s a great all-inclusive machine."
1651,5.0,2018-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Good size for under the counter, you will need space to access the back water tank
Once you’ve practiced and find the right value for the grinder and the amount of coffee to grind, for a specific coffee bean of your like, the quality and taste of the coffee brewed is just perfect!"
1652,5.0,2020-10-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I read the reviews and most of them had only good things to say about this machine. Then after I bought it for my wife I realized why... This thing kicks ass!!
1653,5.0,2021-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had 4 less expensive cappuccino machine over the last 13 years. Each one wore out making a drink a day. Just taking this out of the packaging and running it through the startup instructions I know I have a high quality machine that is going to last for years. My husband shook his head at the $600, But I spent more than that on lesser quality machines in total and despite good care they all had some failure within 4 years."
1654,5.0,2018-05-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is my second Breville espresso machine. I love having the grinder and tamper attached. We had to adjust the grind amount a couple of times at first to get it set to our taste. Perfect cup every time now! Love it.
1655,1.0,2020-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine was beautiful, and I so desperately wanted to love it. The pressure gauge was faulty from the first use. The needle does not move at all. After reading through the manual, watching several trouble shooting tutorials, and trying every texture of grounds and pressure of tamping, nothing could get the needle to move.
Sadly, Amazon would not allow me to exchange the machine for a new one. My only option was to contact the manufacturer or return/refund. I could have went the manufacturer route, but frankly, I didn’t spend $650 on a product to then have to deal with getting replacement parts. After looking through a large amount of negative reviews I have found quite a few buyers who experienced the same issue."
1656,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Oh my god. I just wish I had gotten this earlier. Yes. It’s expensive. Worth ever penny
1657,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased this back in December of 2021, thought I was using in wrong when the steam wand didn’t work after making one latte. Its been 5 months and its keeps on doing the same thing. It works ok if you are only planning on using it by yourself, but I feel coffee is meant to be shared. Don’t buy this and save your money for other machines. Disappointed I paid too much for this …"
1658,5.0,2021-07-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,you will learn how to use it in the first 2 months . After that - hello tasty coffee every morning .
1659,5.0,2020-07-08, Black Sesame,cool gift to give
1660,5.0,2019-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent machine! Have it for over a year and so far-so good! I mix in Different types of coffee beans as well as cinnamon and dried orange or lemon zest right in the grinder. Or nutmeg on a different occasion. Gives it extra something-something for the flavor and my guests always keep wondering what it is. Durable machine, I take care of it with regular cleaning as is recommended, and so far very happy with this purchase. Thank you Breville! Already recommended to friends and relatives.:-)"
1661,5.0,2018-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,We make americano's every day! Easy! Husband uses before going duck hunting - I dont even hear the beans grinding! ...Have to admit- I watched a few you tubes to make sure we knew how to use it and get the creama perfect- and boy was that worth my time. BUY!
1662,5.0,2019-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s great so far , still learning how to make a good shot."
1663,3.0,2018-08-04, Black Sesame,"I bought a brand new Barista Express Machine and a used one from Amazon. i am very pleased with new one, love it, wanted another at 2nd home. I have now bought several used items from Amazon. I have had mixed experiences. Mostly good on simple Items, but any complicated high tech or complex items, I cannot recommend to be purchased used. Reconditioned from the manufacturer may be good, but complex items repackaged by amazon is a joke. My recommendation is to look for reconditioned by the manufacturer and not to buy complex used items from Amazon. The used one leaks water and has multiple issues, it is a lemon."
1664,5.0,2021-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,I only wish I knew how to do latte art. The machine is simple and intuitive. The steamer makes a great foam!
1665,5.0,2019-08-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ive had this one for 2 years now and got to be honest, im loving this thing! Its super easy to use and makes great cups. The wife loves using ""death wish coffee"" with it. Its amazing."
1666,3.0,2019-08-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wasn’t happy with it, some parts were missing and the job it does doesn’t worth the price. Besides the grounder was loader compare to the one I had."
1667,5.0,2019-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect right out of the box. Makes excellent espresso. Easy to operate.
1668,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this for my wife 3 years ago, and it's still going strong! VERY happy with this espresso maker, and we use it for 2 lattes/day roughly 5 times a week. I've cleaned it with the tablets a handful of times, but that's about it. Finally ordering replacement water filters (probably LONG overdue!). Very happy with this machine and it's very ideal for home use."
1669,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"I was eyeballing this for a long time. Had it in my cart for a while and finally pulled the trigger. A year later I can still say that I do not regret my decision. Great quality, easy to use once you figure it out once. The coffee grounds do fall so we put a towel there and just fold it up on top. Got sick of cleaning the grounds all the time."
1670,5.0,2019-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was nervous about paying so much for a home espresso machine but the first latte I made put my fears to rest! I used to have a small Krups espresso machine but after so many years it was finally wearing out. So I decided to get a better, more sophisticated espresso machine. I LOVE the bean grinder and all the grinding options. I like to manage my grind so I do it manually. And the steamer makes the most delicious, velvety foam. I'm completely satisfied with this machine."
1671,5.0,2020-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I splurged buying this machine but am so glad that I did. Can't say anything negative. I have had it for 5 months of daily use with no problems. Has all the adjustments you would ever need, and they all work. The instruction booklet is pretty clear, as well. Switches rapidly from coffee to steam or hot water. Easy to keep clean. Grinder works well with wide adjustments possible. An extremely well thought out design."
1672,3.0,2019-07-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Hard to get unified drinks. Hard to clean.
1673,5.0,2019-07-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have purchased many units but this is by far the best. Now I save a ton of money making my own specialty coffees
1674,5.0,2018-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love everything about this machine.Makes super awesome coffee.Very well designed.Had it for 2 month now.No issues.We do about 12 shots a day in my household,so we are using this one.Had to clean it twice in 2 month,according to a little light that tells you to do so.It will make you get involved in the process ,but once you get a hang of it and figure out all the dials... its a blast!
It is adjustable to your preference.Make sure to buy good coffee as this one will not tolerate supermarket stuff,You ll taste the diff.
We get Lavazza from Amazon.Tasty.
Flaws:
The only flaw so far is when you start steaming milk water drips from hot water nozzle thingy.Minor ,but hopefully its not a gasket going bad."
1675,5.0,2019-06-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I did a lot of research before buying the Breville BSE870XL. Every review I read pointed to this espresso maker (For the price range). I am very glad I bought it. I love it and it works great. It was very easy to learn to use and produces great espresso with a nice crema. I admit I'm a rookie, but you can't go wrong with this machine. Highly recommend anyone looking for an espresso machine to get this one."
1676,4.0,2014-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Still getting used tot his machine. Went from a Starbucks Barista that lasted for over 10 years but started falling apart. So far I like it but have not been able to reprogram the shots to a large enough quantity that I like. If I could do that then I'd probably love this machine. Also, I seem to waste coffee when it's beeing ground and dispensed into the portafilter. It mounds up and falls out. I'm grinding the right amount, though as it is at the correct level once tamped down."
1677,3.0,2019-12-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I don't use my Breville that often. After having made about 20 cups of espresso, the pressure gauge display broke. While it is not necessary for making espresso, it did aide in making a better cup of coffee, especially when switching beans and grinds. For the amount of money this cost, I would expect it should last long enough to see a return on the money spent over hitting the coffee shop (100 visits+). I hope nothing else breaks on this and this was a fluke. Otherwise, I'm fairly happy with this so far."
1678,5.0,2020-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Simple y fácil de usar de una calidad excelente, 10⭐"
1679,5.0,2021-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love the coffee. So special & fun to have this in our home. We are completely enjoying it!
1680,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very well thought out machine, small foot print, comes with almost everything you need to make a great espresso. Powerful enough to practice latte art, yet not too powerful to be intimidated by beginners. I make 3 cups every day for about a year now. Very Happy"
1681,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have never had my own expresso machine, so I didn’t know how to run one at all. This machine is extremely easy to run. I’m having fun making my own drinks! Love it!!!!"
1682,5.0,2021-03-25, Black Sesame,The wife and I love it super easy to use no more over priced coffee shops
1683,5.0,2022-03-30, Black Sesame,"I can say I was affraid since I used it in my country where power is 220V at 50hz, while the Barista Express works at 110v 60hz. I only needed a regular transformer and it worked perfectly.
I've been using it for a few months and improving my barista skills."
1684,5.0,2021-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worth every penny. Coffee tastes amazing and it’s super easy to use
1685,5.0,2020-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,ya it total awesome this model was referred to me by a family member who works in a coffee shop its the best
1686,1.0,2020-11-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I received this product and was very excited because I had seen a lot of really good reviews. After receiving it I unpacked it, washed all the parts as they recommend. I ran it thru the ""start up"" routine which is basically just running hot water thru the steam wand and hot water dispenser. This entire process of unpacking, washing, and preparing the machine probably took an hour. I let the entire unit dry for a day and then the next day I tried to grind some beans. I could hear the grinding rotating but no grounds came thru into the portafilter. i made sure that the beans could easily travel into the grind area, which they could. I made sure that the grinder was turning, and it was. I could even take off the bean hopper and see the coffee that was ground but it couldn't, for some reason, get from the grinder to the portafilter. I changed grind settings. I changed amount settings. I tried 1 cup vs 2 cup settings. I watched youtube videos and what might be wrong. And I cleaned it 3 times hoping that it would start working. But after 3hrs I boxed it up and am now sending it back. I have spent the better part of half a day and am very disappointed. I plan on getting another machine and hoping this was just a fluke in manufacturing. If so I will write another review or retract this one but as of now I'm very disappointed in this product."
1687,5.0,2019-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Our whole family loves this machine. It is expensive but we use it enough that it will pay for itself in no time. Definitely watch youtube reviews and usage tips before you buy.
1688,5.0,2019-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The best espresso coffee maker machine that I bought. I am trying all local puertorrican’s coffees.
I love my espresso machine."
1689,2.0,2018-09-14, Black Sesame,"I bought this Breville Espresso Machine, and in the product description it said that all of the accessories were included with the purchase, and that only a small 1/4"" scratch was in the side of the espresso machine.

I had 2 problems with the espresso. The first one is that the dual wall filters were not shipped with the machine, and those were the ones that i would have been using more if i had them. So That's a big problem for me, and to buy them new, are 20 bucks + shipping, not an extra expense I would like to have after spending 500 bucks in a coffee machine.

Second, The scratch that was in one of the sides was at least 4"" big not 1/4"" and it was not an scratch it was actually a big dent, not only that, but it had several other scratches in the other side and a big one in the front of the machine, which is exactly the place were you wouldn't want to have a dent, also there was a big bent in the base of the machine which makes it off square. But then again, I didn't bought it new, but if I knew it was going to be in this condition I would have spent a few more bucks to have a better looking machine, after all it's not cheap.

My greatest problem is that the dual wall filters were not shipped, and I it said in the description everything was there. So if this guys could ship me that i could get around the other cosmetic problems and put more stars in my review."
1690,5.0,2019-11-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Couldn’t be happier!!! It was a learning curve for sure, but once we got it right, the coffee is amazing!!!"
1691,5.0,2020-10-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is dreamy. Very easy to operate, makes amazing coffee and the frother is pretty powerful too. The only annoying thing is that the bottom gets filled with water rather fast, but it checks all the boxes for a high-quality home espresso machine."
1692,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you want to take your coffee game to the next level, this thing is wonderful."
1693,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After a year, the machine still works great, but the little dual wall basket I use to make my coffee is clogged and can't be cleaned (I tried the trick i read online about heating it and turning coffee residue into carbon, and it didn't work well enough). The company is out of stock of the item. Everyone is. I still have my less convenient single size dual wall filter basket and I'm using that, but in a year when that presumably will plug up, I guess my machine is garbage. 5 stars if a person could get spare parts. I can't recommend this machine. This is appalling."
1694,5.0,2017-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best coffee machine, make delicious coffee, practical and easy to use . Happy with my best company."
1695,5.0,2015-07-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes amazing drinks. Had to read the instructions carefully but after that all good
1696,4.0,2019-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a smaller unit than we expected.
1697,5.0,2019-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's really nice.. However we should prepare fresh coffee bean.. without those, blending would not be working well."
1698,5.0,2016-01-21, Black Sesame,Since I had an expresso machine before getting things set up and calibrated was easy . I set my grind size to 3 and grind amount to the 12 o'clock position . I also use the dual wall insert to insure proper pressure to get the best extraction .
1699,5.0,2017-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I absolutely LOVE my Breville espresso maker. I make several latte's per day, and this machine delivers! My latte's are excellent, just as good if not better than those I can buy from a cafe. The burr grinder is wonderful. I especially like that i can control how much it grinds with a simple push of a button (push the portafilter). The tamper is handy and easy to get to. The burr grinder grinds to perfection.

I had a Cuisinart before, but this one is light years ahead. Also, my service from Breville was exceptional! You get what you pay for. This machine is worth every penny."
1700,5.0,2021-03-16, Black Sesame,"Very good machine, and smell delicious."
1701,1.0,2020-07-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased this unit in December of 2016. It worked wonderfully for about 6 months, and then started developing problems. The machine would make an extremely loud buzzing noise when trying to pull a shot, and the pressure would be minimal or non-existent. I troubleshooted it multiple times and would descale and clean it each time, and the machine would sputter back to life, only for the same problem to occur a few months down the road. In June, the issue occurred again, and this time no amount of troubleshooting, cleaning, or descaling worked. It would appear that the solenoid valve had failed (according to my admittedly amateur online research), and Breville wanted over $200 to fix the issue as the warranty was only valid for 1 year. Thankfully, we had purchased an extended 3rd party warranty on Amazon and were able to recoup the original cost of the machine (minus the cost of the warranty), but this entire experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth about Breville products as a whole. I'd recommend doing a little more research and purchasing a more robust espresso machine and a separate burr grinder, as I am now in the process of doing."
1702,5.0,2020-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This has been one of the best purchases we have made in a long time. Sure, the price tag is high, but this unit is worth every penny. I have saved as much money as I spent by not getting coffees out every day. This unit is extremely easy to use and clean.

One draw back is coffee grounds tend to drop out of the dispenser randomly, creating a little bit of a mess. This one inconvenience is not worth downgrading my review from a 5 star to a 4 star."
1703,5.0,2020-11-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very happy with my purchase. Delicious coffee. I don't want to drink coffee anywhere else, but home."
1704,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent product. Having come from an E62 Rocket, this is designed to match the users need to get too a great coffee quickly.

All the design features work well.

It looks trial and error to get the pressure right for the best extraction but key is the freshness of the beans.

I can't think of a single issue. Would have 5 stars if dual pump. But minor issue around timing only."
1705,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,The grinder on the machine I purchased was not in working order from day one. I called Breville to complain. rather than replace the unit they sent me part that didn’t work. I called back a few months later to complain about the item still not working but they still weren’t able to help. The after purchase support from Breville is really poor. For six an expensive item I’d recommend looking at a brand that has better after sales support. Also I found out through this process that it’s not Breville policy to replace faulty new units but instead you would get a remanufactered. Al round what a horrible customer experience.
1706,5.0,2019-02-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I recommend this machine for coffee lovers......you will be able to make the BEST espressos. Better than any Starbucks y similar to Blue bottle (for the readers in the Bay Area)
1707,5.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wasn't sure I would use this as often as I do, but the ease of use and simplicity of making a good espresso or latte has made it so that I use the all the time. I am very happy that I now own this."
1708,5.0,2020-10-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome
1709,5.0,2020-12-11, Black Sesame,"I’ve saved so much money by not having to go to Starbucks everyday. I’ve perfected my cup of joe and prefer this coffee over any shop. It took a while to tune it in and learn the machine, but my hubby and I are obsessed."
1710,5.0,2020-08-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,This product is amazing works perfectly makes the best cup of espresso. Fast shipping and easy to use
1711,5.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had extremely high expectations for this product because of all the positive reviews. We have now had it for over two months and I think it is probably the best appliance we have ever purchased. It is 100% reliable and makes a fantastic latte. We are thrilled with our purchase and we've used it so much I figure we probably already got our money out of it. If you are any sort of a coffee snob or really prefer a superior cup of coffee, this unit is well worth the money."
1712,5.0,2018-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the best espresso machine I have ever owned! It pulls a perfect double shot and steams the milk nicely. I LOVE THIS!!!
1713,5.0,2020-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nice looking machine that works well so far.
1714,5.0,2017-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine! Works so well and has been a blessing during COVID stay at home orders.
1715,1.0,2020-03-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Too difficult to make a cup in the morning. Only makes 1 Oz expresso and good luck programing it. But it looks very pretty.
1716,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is one of my favorite gadgets I've ever purchased. I bought it for my girlfriend as a Valentine's Day present. Neither of us are experienced Espresso brewers, and we both immediately fell in love with the process on this machine. It is very user friendly for the new users, and it is customizable enough that experienced espresso masters can still make things their own way. Very small and compact, looks great in the kitchen, easy to clean, and makes delicious espressos!"
1717,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Kind of a temperamental little machine. I have to adjust the grind almost daily to get the right pressure for the pour. You waste a LOT of coffee while you're learning to use it, and I was a barista for 10 years. That being said, once you play around with it, it makes awesome espresso and foams milk very nicely. It has paid for itself twice over since I have been able to make my own coffees instead of hitting the coffee shop! It comes with everything you could possibly need and the directions are clear and very helpful."
1718,5.0,2014-05-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After we bought this machine, I start drinking coffee everyday in the morning!"
1719,5.0,2018-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best gift I ever bought myself! Even my husband has a new love for homemade espresso! Easy to use. Easy to clean.
1720,5.0,2020-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is worth every penny. I'm drinking the best espressos ever and it will take me forever to learn how to get full use from it. You tube is helping. This machine will make you jump out of bed in the morning just to get a cuppa.
1721,3.0,2020-05-23, Black Sesame,There is a problem with the grinder
1722,5.0,2020-10-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worth the money. Easy, quick, lots of thought put into the design. Made well. I have a feeling the reviews that say it messed up or stopped working after 6+ months don’t clean or maintain it and probably just let things build up. Just like anything, take care of your investment. Breville made it pretty easy to clean and take of this machine."
1723,5.0,2019-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We purchased Barista Express for our small coffeshop in Istanbul, it is a great machine considering its price and size. There are two things to know for beginners. Practice a lot for mastering the machine: Be careful with how much you tamp the ground coffee, do not tamp too much and do not add too much ground coffee to the portafilter. I write this because the device can get heated up in which casethe cooling system gets active and stops the machine. If you plan to use it commercially it can be a big problem so be a master of the tamper and the coffee! Other than that I can easily say that it is a great barista machine even for commercial use."
1724,4.0,2019-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Ive changed my review from 1 star to 4 stars because Breville’s customer service finally came through. The solenoid on my espresso machine went out 13 months after purchase. Breville fixed it free of charge and paid for shipping as well despite the product being outside the warranty period. I took away one star considering a $600 machine should be built to last more than 13 months. I would recommend using distilled water if you want to prolong its life.
1725,5.0,2018-12-12, Black Sesame,I love this machine. It's everything that I hoped and more! The possibilities are endless in drink creations and I am so grateful to have one in my kitchen!
1726,5.0,2018-12-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it, watch some YouTube videos to perfect using it. It's basically a chemistry set that is delicious :)"
1727,5.0,2021-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s a must have for wfh! Nothing to complain about!!
1728,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Totally love the machine so far. There was a bit of calibration that had to be done but all in all it was pretty easy. We purchased the beans from our favorite coffee shop and I'm happy to say our cappuccinos our almost spot on.
1729,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I needed this in my life! I’ll never go to a coffee shop ever again in my life.
1730,5.0,2019-11-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Read the reviews, this thing is spectacular and in over a year i have not had a single problem with it. Could not be more pleased with this purchase"
1731,5.0,2019-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a great machine! Easy to use & makes a great espresso! Worth the money!
1732,3.0,2020-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,you do not want to see this even you getting a used item. do you have any idea how long does the milk has been sticking there. it’s cleanable and just use the accessories in the box. how difficult is it? obviously breville noticed this problem but shipper doesn’t.
1733,5.0,2017-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Owned this for a month now. I’ve been told, by coffee aficionados, the different coffee products we make with this are top quality and delicious! Watch the various YouTube videos on this. They really helped us to up our game and understand the subtle tips and tricks."
1734,5.0,2020-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love my coffee a few times a day!
This machine had change my view of coffee makers! What a differences in taste and smell.
If you love coffee like I do yes get this machine, you will love it!"
1735,5.0,2019-05-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine and use it multiple times a day. It does take some practice to learn to use well, but if you read the manual, you’ll learn. I’d buy this again in a heartbeat!"
1736,5.0,2020-04-27, Black Sesame,This unit doesn't take up much counter space and it's easy to use. Love it.
1737,5.0,2019-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I waited quite a while to purchase this, thinking the price was too high. After doing the math on what I am spending on disposable pods in my other espresso maker, this will pay for itself shortly. The espresso is much better, there is more flexibility in what I am making than what the pod version had. The quality is an 11 out of 10. I highly recommend this for person who loves good espresso drinks. I cannot say enough good things about this machine. It is everything I wanted and expected and more!"
1738,5.0,2017-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After lots of research we decided to get this espresso machine. Took a lot of trial and error to get the right cup of espresso, but the process has been fun and rewarding."
1739,5.0,2020-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent espresso cappuccino maker. Still learning it’s full potential. Very happy
1740,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine easy to use. I find it really hard to make the foam art but that’s on me. I have one and my son has one we both love it.
1741,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Simply put, this machine is AWESOME!"
1742,5.0,2015-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine and now I can enjoy a quite decent coffee without buying from outside.
1743,5.0,2021-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought the one without the grinder for my Dad a year ago and liked it so much that I decided to get this one for myself. My only gripe(not a complaint cause its my fault)is that it doesn't fit underneath my cabinets with the grinder on. If your cabinets go to the ceiling you should be fine though. For now Im going to have to either find another spot or simply use coffee grinds until we remodel our kitchen.
1744,5.0,2020-08-04, Black Sesame,"This machine makes excellent espresso based drinks...just get fresh beans and follow the instructions including YouTube videos from Phil McKnight. I have included a picture of a latte that I made this morning.

Only negative is that it grinds a little too much coffee (even when the dosage setting is at the minimum) but that would be 3-5 beans worth, and the steam dies after only one cup. So you need a machine restart between cups. But apart from these two points, you have the best product on the market at this price point and form factor. Highly recommended!"
1745,5.0,2021-05-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband and I love coffee and are thinking about opening a coffee shop and thought we should experiment with specialty coffees so we purchased this machine. We have used it several times and have made several types of specialty coffee drinks. We have had it about 30 days and have had no issues. It works just as described and as shown in the short video.
1746,5.0,2020-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love my BBE! Buy a bottomless portafilter and scale. Always buy and use fresh beans.
1747,5.0,2020-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I can feel the real flavor of my espresso with this machine ..... and my cappuccinos are PERFECT ...
1748,4.0,2017-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s a good machine however I wish the instructions was user friendly. If wasn’t for all the YouTube videos I would have been lost.
1749,5.0,2021-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am a newbie when it comes to espresso but I love coffee. This product was easy to set up and use and I’m getting better at frothing every day! Eventually I think I may upgrade but right now this is perfect for my use case
1750,2.0,2021-05-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 Breville espresso machine leaking water from bottom. It's only one week old. My old Capresso worked almost 5 years without any issues. I ordered second one and this one going to return back to Amazon. If second one will be a $600 lemon as well I am going to order other brand."
1751,5.0,2016-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Breville is simply the best. This machine is easy to use, makes great espresso and looks beautiful."
1752,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best money I've ever spent! I'm a former barista and I think it's pretty easy to use. I didn't have to adjust it too much. It pulls an amazing shot! The steam wand is a bit slow and doesn't steam milk super hot (like in a regular coffee shop) but I usually make iced lattes and mochas. If this breaks in 10 years, I'll definitely buy another espresso machine from Breville."
1753,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Estoy encantada
1754,5.0,2022-02-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,I just received it today. I used this to brew 3 times and I am learning as I use this machine.. It keeps getting better as I learn. I had a best espresso in a long time.
1755,5.0,2017-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Awesome espresso machine, which satisfies me, my family and all my friends. Great in making Americano, latte, espresso. Some experience and you will be able to make coffee, which will taste as one of the best coffee brewed by professionals! I use several types of Italian Lavazza, buying it from Seattle Coffee Gear shop, but it all depends on your taste. Thank you, Breville, for your great quality product, and Amazon, for selling it! Ten stars."
1756,5.0,2019-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve made at least 1000 espressos with this in the last 9 months. I love this machine.
1757,4.0,2019-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very sophisticated espresso machine, looks great, it feels nice now but I have doubts it will last more than 2 years. Hard to dial in good amount and flavor with all the settings."
1758,5.0,2021-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is capable of beating your above average coffee shop and is of amazing build quality!
1759,5.0,2022-08-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I LOVE This!
This espresso machine is the best, really good espresso shots. For longer life has to be done all the cleaning on time."
1760,5.0,2018-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Incredible!!!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this espresso maker with the grinder! My husband and I decided to splurge and get the one with the grinder and are so glad we did. We now have amazing espresso and lattes every morning. It was a little bit of work to get it to work right since you really do need to pack the grounds tights and have the exact right amount in there, but after a few tries and practice, we have no problems. I'm in love with this machine!"
1761,1.0,2020-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this machine and it is defective. The dial on the side only randomly works. This was a HUGE waste of money. DO NOT PURCHASE! You will be sorry.
1762,3.0,2021-08-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very very difficult to make a true 20-30 second espresso shot. If you have the time to weigh beans out between14g-17g for each shot, dial in temp, grind, time and weight this machine is for you because it's fun playing with but annoying when you can't make a decent cup of espresso in 30min and wasting countless shots."
1763,5.0,2021-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After tons of research, having to return a Breville Infuser because the pressure gauge didn't work and accessories not needed, I ordered this Barista. I was nervous. But holy cow!!!!! This machine is WONDERFUl, is so well designed and has everything needed to make a great cup of espresso. The grinder is great and pressure gauge works perfectly. You can spend twice what this costs and not get better espresso, so don't be afraid to order this. You will be so glad you did."
1764,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have not gone to the coffeehouse since we bought this. It’s so easy to make barista quality drinks and looks so nice on the counter.
1765,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best product we got for WFH days!
1766,3.0,2021-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this machine about a month ago and mastered the perfect espresso and cappuccino within a few days. The thing I hate most about it, and it seems to me that it would've been an easy fix when designing it, is in order to get the right amount of grounds, it literally over flows grounds all over the porta filter, I then tamp it down, then have to add more and re tamp. This is for a double shot, the grind amount is set to about 50% yet it still overflows all over and isn't enough. Not sure why they didn't make the porta filter deeper to accommodate the right amount of grinds and avoid making a mess and waisting coffee. Other then that, it's been a great machine."
1767,5.0,2020-01-20, Black Sesame,Great product
1768,5.0,2020-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After 6 months and over 800 uses, it's still delivering perfect espresso. This machine can be tailored to make espresso just to your preferences. It's paid for itself three times over. I took it to a holiday gathering, and the machine and I were the stars of the party. I was serving non-stop for two hours before dinner, and then another hour for after-dinner gourmet shots. Small enough to be portable for an event, sturdy enough to last.

UPDATE: 14 July 2016. Still going strong, no faults, no failures, still brewing fine with one or two daily uses. That's over 1500 shots and still satisfying my morning coffee craving. Very happy."
1769,5.0,2021-01-19, Black Sesame,"Update: after 3 years, still going strong! The latte tastes even better because of my experience with the unit.

I drink enough coffee and become quit picky about it. This machine took me a couple of weeks of practice to get the handle of it (especially the frothing part). It is very important to practice different kind of milk, beans and tamping pressure combination to make it your taste. I can now make consistently great lattes with it but still can't get the froth consistent enough to do latte art (thick foam on top). Highly recommend this machine, no regrets of the purchase."
1770,4.0,2021-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this Espresso Maker about 2 weeks. I choose this one over a totally automatic machine for the removable bean hopper and the ability to use pre-ground coffee. The learning curve for this machine is much steeper than for any of the other machines I have owned. Despite the steep learning curve the machine works well, and makes a good cup of espresso and excellent foam. Find this to be an excellent choice for the price paid."
1771,5.0,2020-11-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Right out of the box it worked great. I've used another espresso maker for many years and this one blew it out of the water. I tried the non-pressurized basket and I am a failure at that. But the pressurized baskets work great. So far (2 months) am loving this machine. I watched several videos before purchasing, one at The Coffee People in Seattle."
1772,5.0,2020-06-25, Black Sesame,"I love the way it makes lattes, easy to use and looks great"
1773,5.0,2018-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It takes a bit to learn how to use it. But do not give up. Once you have the right settings, you will be surprised about the quality and taste of the coffee you make. No need to go to any coffee shop anymore. The coffee you make with this product is far better."
1774,5.0,2021-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I sent the first one back because it was used, but the next one came new. I have to say it is awesome!!! I should have bought this year ago!"
1775,5.0,2020-12-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Watched some youtube vids and learned how to dial it in. I am now making lattes up to par with my favorite hip coffee shops and saving $ Love it!
1776,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Not enough explanation of function in instructions. Had to look for help on forums and friends who own the same machine.
1777,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolutely love this espresso machine, it will pay for it’s self in a matter of months. The quality of coffee it produces is perfect! I’ve tried other brands of machines in the past and the Breville is the absolute best. I would buy this again!"
1778,5.0,2018-09-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,An excellent home espresso maker for the price. Perfect first machine for the budding home barista.
1779,5.0,2021-05-25, Black Sesame,I have had mine for over a year .I could not live without it. I saved so much money and I love using it every day and evening ...
1780,5.0,2021-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Second machine I've purchased. It's great to have a two in one. Only thing I can recommend is to purchase the extended Amazon 3 year warranty. These things can break so for 30 bucks protect yourself.
1781,3.0,2019-11-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,The pressure gauge is not working.
1782,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Clean the milk steamer and the filter for best results
1783,5.0,2020-11-21, Black Sesame,Estamos más q contento con el producto. Super enamorada de ella
1784,5.0,2021-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and son-in-law! They absolutely love it!!!
1785,3.0,2021-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was not as happy as I thought I would be. The grounds spray out the tube while grinding. We have to cover with our hand to avoid it from going all over the counter. The water capacity doesn’t seem to last long. The machine requested we clean it, the first couple weeks we owned it. I think that is a bit wrong...I know someone else has one and it doesn’t request to be cleaned as often."
1786,5.0,2019-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife and I have made 2 or more espresso drinks a day with this since learning how to use it, which is incredibly simple, if a bit messy until you get your workflow right. If you're spending $5 a day at your local cafe, consider saving money and getting this instead. It's a neat appliance, it's pretty, it works great, and if you've never made espresso before, you'll have a new-found appreciation for your friendly neighborhood baristas and how stressful it is to need to make several perfect dopeos under pressure.

2019 update: still works great! Considering an upgrade. Caffeine addiction turned into full-on espresso obsession. 👍"
1787,5.0,2022-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wow! Looked at some videos on YouTube and within a few time was churning out made to order fufu coffee. Even got my 23 yo son to start enjoying and MAKING great home made coffee drinks. Let the experiments continue.

1789,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"Once you learn how to use this machine, you will never use anything else!!! I can't even go to coffee shops anymore because mine tastes so much better at home. Would recommend to anyone!!"
1790,5.0,2016-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Ans cappuccino &n latte's to boot - all made easy and tasty.
1791,5.0,2021-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have had this machine for four years. I can say, without reservation, this is the favorite part of our home. We easily make six or more drinks a day; our family/friends tells us it’s the best coffee. We recommend this to anyone shopping for a coffee maker."
1792,5.0,2018-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ohh, the best purchase I've made. I'm so happy that I returned the gaggia and bought this machine. The coffee is a lot better. I use it every day. Every single day. Must buy!"
1793,5.0,2021-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing! Easy to use and gives you coffee shop quality.
1794,5.0,2021-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nice and cool. Easy to use
1795,5.0,2021-04-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have a small coffee shop in Mexico. I decided to buy a small espresso machine to start out with. I did not want to spend thousands of dollars on a machine. This machine has been almost perfect. The grinder part is great. On less thing on counter. It does take sometime for the steam to start steaming for say a cappuccino. I love this machine and will buy another. I spoke to a person in Seattle who sells espresso machines and she told me that it could easily work for small coffe house. 40 cups and hour not a problem. Water tank is small but just need to refill which is very easy.

1796,5.0,2019-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this as a gift for my daughter and her family. They LOVE it.
1797,5.0,2016-11-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am a cappuccino making fool! I bought this knowing I would get my return on investment. I also wanted to learn to be my own barista. This is one of my favorites products I have bought in years. I love it. It is really easy to use- just read instructions. So well built and thought out. I am really amazed by it!
1798,5.0,2020-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes amazing coffee and is very easy to use once you get it set up. It takes a few attempts to get the coffee coming out the way you like it. I get the 2.2-Pound bag of Lavazza Super Crema Whole Bean Coffee Blend on amazon. The machine settings I use are grind size = 5, grind amount = 3 o’clock position, filter size = single, filter = single non-dual wall, shots = double shot."
1799,5.0,2021-05-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Not enough good words. It was a present for my coffee addicted hubby and I really changed his life ( in many ways ): no more waiting time with the moka! The espresso coffee is ready in NO TIMe and it is simply perfect.
1800,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"amazing machine - this is my second one, and it never fails to impress. Fresh ground beans make all the difference, and it delivers perfect shots and perfect steamed milk every time. Easy fill water tank, easy clean grinder, and programmable shots all help to make this Breville my choice for espresso. Only complaint, if you want to call it that, is that it drips some water when you turn on the steam wand, but it only lasts a few seconds and then it's on to making delicious drinks."
1801,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent in every way. Once you get it dialed in, a fresh cup takes under 2 minutes. Grinder makes a big difference in taste vs pre ground."
1802,5.0,2021-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have been wanting to buy tgis espresso machine for a while now, but wanted to research all of our options first. I am so glad we got thos one, its so easy and amazing. It took a lot of practice to pull the shots without being bitter, but that's natural. Now we don't even go to starbucks anymore cause we can make our chai drinks at home"
1803,5.0,2021-07-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this espresso machine! It works so well
And is well worth the initial investment!"
1804,5.0,2020-03-30, Black Sesame,Best espresso maker on the market!
1805,5.0,2017-10-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wonderful Machine that pulls amazing espresso. It heats water incredibly fast. My only desire would be for a bigger water tank, but that is minor. Everything else works exactly as specificed. Would reccomend the stainless steel as I believe it holds up better than my friends red version."
1806,5.0,2022-05-28, Black Sesame,We have had 2previous espresso machines and this one is far superior. The coffee drinks are so much smoother and my husband enjoys using it.
1807,5.0,2020-02-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very nice express machine for the money and an investment if you love espresso. About a month of owning this espresso machine, I love it. I'm making way better espresso drinks than what I usually buy at Starbucks or other coffee shops. This machine is fairly easy to use, the only real learning curve is adjusting the whole extraction process for different types of espresso beans."
1808,5.0,2020-02-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I owned two coffee shops (which I sold years ago) and have desperately tried to recreate the perfect latte. For a long time I thought it was impossible with any non-commercial espresso machine. Until now...

This machine is perfect - the perfect size, the perfect components, a real steam wand, the whole nine yards. I bought my favorite San Francisco coffee (Front in Potrero Hill), put the beans in, and voila - on the first try PERFECT shots. Perhaps that's an anomaly - without any tweaking I got perfect shots - but nonetheless, I was extremely impressed.

I strongly recommend this machine, I'll update this review if I run into any issues since I've only had the machine two days."
1809,5.0,2018-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased new in Oct 2018. Makes great, full-bodied americanos, espresso, and cappuccino. It does take a few weeks to learn how to use it well. This machine has been completely reliable. I would definitely buy it again."
1810,5.0,2017-08-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolutely love my Breville! Makes amazing espresso with ease! Only con is that it can be a pain to clean up. Otherwise, it’s worth every penny!"
1811,2.0,2021-03-12, Black Sesame,"I purchased this in June and we found weldon't use it very often- maybe a few times a week. It took work to get the right grind and amount to make the pressure right. Now, in early november the hot water won't come out. I goggle fixes and tried ""decalcifying"" with vigor etc. When calling Breville customer services the hold time is 40-60 minutes. I've had to call a few times because they called back 1 hr later and i was in a place I couldn't talk. I had to set aside time for this. When I finally spoke with someone one of the things they said could be wrong is that our water is too filtered (reverse osmosis) so that the machine can sense the amount (are you kidding?), or that we don't use it enough- it should be used everyday. Really? They are sending out a ""descaled"" that should be done every month. There are a few maintenance things that are supposed to be done every month. If this solution doesn't work I have to send it in.
Its such an expensive machine so I'm disappointed. I'd rather just make a pot of coffee."
1812,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I like i,t Breville helped me alot with the use of it and even send a replacement (some problem with the grinder) Please view videos and educate yourself on this machine. It takes time to really get it right so make sure you want to spend the money. I will keep it but have not found the coffee I like for it, working on my 3rd brand."
1813,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"the flavor is good, however, It is not reliable. after I use them for 1.5 years, they are out of order. I bought second one, still out of order after use 1.5 years"
1814,5.0,2021-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine!
1815,5.0,2021-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have used this machine several times a day since purchasing over a month ago and it is incredible. It is very easy to keep clean and the instruction guide is thorough and very helpful. I would (and do) recommend this product to anyone looking for an espresso machine.
1816,5.0,2020-04-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have to have our coffee in the mornings, otherwise life is dull ;)
After stressing to make it through Starbucks morning lines, or not having time to get coffee before work, we decided it’s tome to bring the espresso to us...
Different life changing, coffee tastes absolutely on another level with this machine. Definitely worth every dollar!!!"
1817,5.0,2021-04-05, Black Sesame,Especially good for beginners learning to steam milk for the first time. Good long term buy because it produces high quality drinks better than I’ve had from other machines. Nespresso is a fast food drink compared to what you will get from this.
1818,5.0,2021-09-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought my Barista Express in August and once I learned the ropes and fully followed instructions, I fell in love with it. It gets used 2 to 4 times daily and makes truly outstanding coffee/espresso. I use Peet's Major Dickinson's Blend and find my results superior to any of the local coffee shops--and that is in the coffee phobic North West. I like starting my day with a double Americano with a little steamed milk. Try it, you'll like it."
1819,3.0,2020-05-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After about 100 espresso shots, I give up. I am about 20% for getting a good one. I've read all of the review and watched all of the how to videos out there. I have used a bathroom scale and practiced my tamp to get the right weight. I have been using the freshest of roasts possible from the same source. I have adjusted the grind. End result, 80% I get over extracted sour coffee. Not real happy about the steaming action either. I wanted so much to love this machine. I have almost all of Breville's other products and couldn't be happier with them. I am not giving up on the machine but I don't hold out much hope. I should have invested in a brand that has built their reputation on coffee."
1820,2.0,2021-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is my third espresso machine – the earlier two were Gaggios. I bought the Breville based on numerous positive reviews.
I have had the machine in my possession since February 24. Everyday I read the instructions for more detailed “fine-tuning” of my use (including fresh coffee, heated cups, a Breville pitcher with built-in thermostat, etc.)
So far, the machine is unreliable in the steaming function. It stops and won’t restart, requiring a long wait/reset period. And the time required in between making one cup and the next is quite long compared to my Gaggias.
I spent over ten minutes with customer support and found it most unhelpful...I ended it when the ""expert"" told me to unplug the machine and replug it.
So, at this point, I will return the machine through Amazon and buy another Gaggia."
1821,5.0,2020-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine. Lately I have been making espresso shakes and it tastes great!
1822,5.0,2019-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes the best coffee! It does have a learning curve to it but once you get it down it is wonderful. Use it every morning to make my latte for work. Very well made and it is heavy. Looks great on the counter :)
1823,5.0,2020-09-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy machine to use. High quality and worth ever penny!
1824,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I can't believe the $700 plus tax expresso machine only lasted 9 months (mind you, I only used the machine 3-4 times a week when I work from home). The pressure gauge stopped working last month. There was no pressure whatsoever. I have tried different ways (following Youtube videos) trying to get the pressure up to no avail. This is very disappointing!"
1825,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have this machine at work and loved how great coffee taste, especially compared to Starbucks and Coffee Bean. I bought one during cyber Monday and so far, I'm super happy with my purchase. My roommate loves it as well."
1826,4.0,2018-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. It is a quality machine that you can see and even feel. Built in grinder is a huge plus for me. It took a few tries to get the right grind, amount of coffee and tamp. Be patient and find the right settings and you will be good to go. Easy to clean, steam wand will pivot in any direction to work with any size milk pitcher."
1827,5.0,2021-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this Breville Espresso Machine as a special Christmas gift for my daughters new home. She was extremely happy and absolutely loves this item. The coffee that she makes with the Breville is absolutely delicious. Absolutely deserving of my five star rating.
1828,5.0,2020-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my first espresso machine and I am very happy with it.
Easy to grind, and very consistent taste.
I like that I can adjust grind and amount, considering using it with different beans.

So far, so good after 1 month usage."
1829,2.0,2020-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Hi every one,
I bought this machine 3 months ago and she stops working,
Amazon does not give a full refund because you have 30 days windows (this is how they call it)
after a lot of phones calls and a lot of wasted time amazon give me a partial refund for the machine
**ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING FOR ALL MIDDLE EAST BUYERS**
BREVILLE DOES NOT GIVE WARRANTY ON MACHINES THAT COMES OUT FROM USA
So if you buy this machine and you from the middle east you need to know that you don't have any warranty.
The machine working on 110V and NOT 220v so buy a transformer or don't buy it
I did all those mistakes and i lost a lot of money because after 3 months the machine stop working and amazon does not describe the voltage of the machine, Breville does not give me a warranty and i take the partial refund of 388$ from amazon (That's Nothing)"
1830,5.0,2021-02-16, Black Sesame,"I have owned several espresso machines (including the Illy x1), and this is far and away the best.

The manufacturer includes everything necessary to make a great espresso, americano, cappuccino, etc.

The only thing that could make it better is if it was not made in China, however the quality control is superb so likely a non-issue. I could not reccomend this machine more."
1831,5.0,2021-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,This was an excellent purchase. Bought another one for our daughter. Makes the perfect cup of cappuccino easily.
1832,4.0,2018-10-08, Black Sesame,"Takes maybe a tiny more cleaning than I would like, but everything else about this product is fantastic"
1833,5.0,2020-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely love making coffee with this machine. Works perfect.
1834,4.0,2020-06-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this! Has saved me so much money! My only complaint is that sometimes the beans don’t go all the way down to the grinder so it squeals. I have to move and shake the bean holder a bit to ensure the beans filter evenly down to the grinder.
1835,5.0,2020-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Expensive but works very well. I have now had this machine for 10 months and it makes wonderful lattes. As someone else said the fresher the milk the better the froth. I do find that manually measuring the coffee is better than the automatic measure. I don't waste any coffee that way. Everyone that drinks my lattes loves them. I know have had the machine for 2 years I make at least 2 lattes a day and it is still going strong!! When I have to replace it I will get the same machine. EXCELLENT !!!
1836,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,Love it!
1837,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent espresso machine! Best overall value and feature balance of many options on the market. After taking the time to learn the machine and fine tune its settings, we’re making lattes and espressos that rival the best cafes. Great product and excellent quality."
1838,5.0,2018-11-23, Black Sesame,Had some early problems and called Breville and worked through my issues. It works better and tastes best with freshly roasted beans. I was using Starbucks espresso beans and they definitely are not fresh roasted. Also the user instructions are not too accurate concerning pre-infusion and extraction times. Pay attention to the guage. Overall we love it. I drink cappuccinos and my wife likes Americano. We were spending about $50 a week at Starbucks and dealing with overworked and inexperienced baristas....
1839,5.0,2018-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine for a few days now and I have to say, I am quite impressed. I am a novice at making espresso based drinks and after a few tries, I am able to make drinks from this machine, that look, smell and taste great. Have received several compliments from family members and friends.

The build quality of the machine is impressive. No cheap plastics and the user manual/quick start guide is well written and easy to follow. I love that is also comes with a hot water dispenser, so making Americanos is quick and easy.

I highly recommend this machine to anyone searching for a new or replacement machine in this price range."
1840,5.0,2016-12-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have had this Breville for years and I still love it! I can make any coffee drink that I want to with this machine. I feel spoiled having it because I like what I make way better than what I can get when I am out and about ordering a latte at a coffee shop. Highly recommend for the espresso lover!
1841,5.0,2021-05-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My super machine! Every morning starts with latte and could not find any café which could reach that taste. Probably only a good Italian restaurant can get it. Constantly quality until now. Easy to clean. Handling is always a little study with a half automatic, but there are also a lot of people on youtube.
Delivery was in time. I cannot say anything negative right now."
1842,1.0,2020-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The first few times I tried the machine I couldn’t get it up into espresso pressure range. I called into customer support and they said the whole bean coffee I was using was not fresh, and I should use the double walled filter. No matter which bean I use (roasted down the street or Starbucks) I still always have to use that filter. I’ve tried adjusting grind size, pressure of the tamp, and quantity but still have to use the same filter. It’s not a big problem, just would have liked to use all of the pieces that they sent me. Absolutely no complaints about how it foams milk.

OK - adjusting my review down to a 1 from a 4 star.

First, had to completely dissemble the grinder as the ports were clogged. Keep in mind this unit was only about 6 months old.

Then I keep getting an espresso puck that is overly wet with a film of water on top and the filter was not filling with grinds as it initially did. Called customer service again. Was told to adjust the grind quantity. Set it to max - no change in quantity. Then adjusted grind fineness. After considerable tweaking got the grind quantity, consistency and range within norms. 3 days later - wet pucks & clogged ports.

I have owned DeLonge Super-Automatic and commercial Nouva Simonelli."
1843,5.0,2021-05-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,coffee is one of my favorite things so a little getting use to but worth it
1844,5.0,2019-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the exact same espresso maker we have used for years, but the old one died. Apparently, they do not last forever, especially is you accidentally drop an entire mug of water into the grinder section. Who knew? lol This time I bought the 4 year warrantee. I see now there is a note to not spill water into the grinder, so obviously I am not the only idiot who managed to do this."
1845,2.0,2021-04-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've used this product for about a year (1-2 times per day). Purchased brand new thru Amazon. Worked flawlessly till now. The grinder just gets jammed with ground beans and semi-ground beans. Took the full grinder apart and cleaned, dried, did everything. Have to clean this every other day to prevent jamming. Would like to buy new parts for the grinder and renew it, but that is not possible. So basically, I have a $500 coffee machine that is a year old sitting on my counter and functions only to get hot water. This is NOT acceptable. I expected it to last much longer than this. Enjoyed it while it lasted. Definitely not buying this brand again."
1846,5.0,2020-10-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this product and i literally use it every day. It takes a little work to dial the machine in and a little bit of a learning curve but none-the-less, i love it!!!"
1847,5.0,2019-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I did a lot of research for the perfect espresso machine and finally made the decision for the XL870. After 2-3 months of usage, the verdict is clear. It’s the best value for money. I looked at leas expensive and thus also more manual. My advice, don’t save $100-200 to downgrade the model. This comes with everything and the built in grinder is the bomb. Makes espresso and lattes as you went to a great coffee shop."
1848,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,My whole family loves this machine. My kids all come by to make themselves lattes all the time.
1849,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I spent over 2 months reading reviews of the many espresso machines in forums and Youtube videos before deciding on this one. This is my first venture into the world of specialty coffee brewing and I absolutely love it and this machine! With just enough automatic features to give you adjustments in making great espressos to your taste yet enough manual use to feel you are able to tweak it to exactly what you want.
1850,1.0,2021-07-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,The grinder is terrible. Half of the time it just spins and won’t pass the grounds through to the filter. I’ve adjusted the grind amount on the side wheel and even took the top grinder out and adjusted it to coarse as well. You have to vacuum excess beans/grounds out of the top every time in order to try and fix it. Then try a handful of beans again only to have it not work. Very frustrating for this price.
1851,5.0,2020-09-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Girlfriend asked for this for Christmas. I agreed, and use it more than her. Love this thing. Making my own quality lattés each morning is great. Make epic hot chocolate for my kids with the steamer too."
1852,5.0,2018-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great for home use, easy to maintain. My parents have had one for many years so I took the chance. Have to fiddle with the controls to get the grinding of the beans right but once you have it, it’s good. Replaced a DeLonghi that leaked before its first birthday."
1853,5.0,2020-11-23, Black Sesame,"Use it daily. Is holding up well and all parts seem to be of top quality. Only issue I have found is sometimes the beans get trapped and aren't properly funneled into the grinder, but can easily be fixed by moving them around or knocking on the cap. Overall not a deal breaker and would still recommend!"
1854,4.0,2020-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine makes excellent coffee and helps you understand how to pack the grinds properly (we have been doing this improperly in our old machine resulting in the bitter taste of the coffee). Only drawback is the mess that can be made from the grinder. We just set it to a smaller level and pack the grinds, then put more in until the proper amount is achieved. much less mess that way."
1855,1.0,2018-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am so sick of adjusting this machine! I’m using the same coffee! Nothing changes but from day to day I have to make about 5 pulls to get a decent one. I’m wasting so much coffee it’s ridiculous! And my coffee is super expensive because I drink a low acid, mycotoxin free coffee. I’m sick of wasting bags of this expensive coffee because my machine can’t hold a consistency. I’ve watched every YouTube video out there. I know how to make all of the adjustments, the problem is the machine changes from cup to cup. I even weigh every single time! I’m so disappointed in this machine! I had a much cheaper calphalon one before. I thought I was upgrading but the reality is that my $200 calphalon pulled way better shots!"
1856,5.0,2020-05-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Everything I could ever want. Well made, pulls excellent shots, stretches milk like a champion (though obviously slower and lower steam pressure than a commercial machine) and looks great in my kitchen. Also bought a tamp mat and a knock box to complete my set up.

Make sure you keep your tank filled, hopper full of beans, and always clean it when it asks to be cleaned, and you will have no trouble!

Thank you breville for an affordable but exceptional quality espresso machine!"
1857,5.0,2021-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far, so good. I'm really hoping this machine lasts because we have used it only 2-3 drinks everyday for the last couple of weeks. I've already saved myself so much money from going to Starbucks and am looking forward to being able to make blended frappe's once it starts getting warmer outside. Will update rating if machine goes out like previous posters have warned about but so far we haven't had any issues."
1858,1.0,2019-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have been a barista for many years and was looking forward to being able to make cortados at home. But this espresso machine is way to difficult to use, espresso either comes out burnt or nothing comes out but a drop of liquid. Trying to return"
1859,5.0,2020-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It takes a bit of trial and error, but once all all grinds, etc. are to my satisfaction, it is great! I have used the machine 1 to 2 times daily for almost 1 month. No problems with function. I have also only bought one commercial drink in almost 30 days- a huge savings at $6/day. So far I am very pleased with the machine."
1860,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,The whole family is enjoying learning to be baristas & drinking espresso.
1861,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this machine almost two years ago, and the price was much cheaper than now. Good machine."
1862,5.0,2014-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Exactly what I was looking for in an espresso machine! Makes great espresso but it takes time to get it right. Stick with it and follow the directions in the manual and search online for tips and tricks!
1863,5.0,2021-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the first espresso machine my wife and I have purchased, in an attempt to wean ourselves off a certain popular coffee chain. The BES870XL looks great and has been very easy for us to learn to make drinks with! The built in grinder was a key point for us, as it helps save on counter space and make for one less thing we needed to buy. I'd highly recommend this machine to anyone looking to make their first big step into espresso at home."
1864,2.0,2019-03-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After doing a careful comparison of the espresso makers on the market, I made the plunge to purchase the
Breville BES870XL Barista Express Espresso machine and feel like I have buyers remorse. The machine hardly puts out a consistent cup of express, no matter how fresh the beans you use. Unfortunately, you end up using the double-walled insert to obtain any sort of consistent 'espresso zone pressure', but the coffee simply doesn't taste the same. Add in the fact this machine is kind of a pain to maintain for a cleaning perspective, and you're better off investing in somethings else, especially for the price."
1865,2.0,2021-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Let me start by saying that this machine can brew a good shot of espresso. That said let me get down to the nitty-gritty

1. The steam wand is not powerful enough for any kind of latte art.
2. The grinder is not powerful enough to grind fine beans to brew using single-walled baskets, essentially relying on the dual-wall baskets to generate enough pressure for brewing. Practically, the grinder settings make no difference when using a pressurized basket since all pressure is generated by the dual wall system.
3. It has a 54 mm Porta filter. At max it can hold 17gms coffee. Even at the lowest setting the grinder grinds 17gms so the dial to set grind amount is also pretty useless.

Great machine for beginners, definitely not for the advanced enthusiast."
1866,5.0,2016-05-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Does everything I was looking for. Grinding coffee to making a great froth. Very pleased with its performance.
1867,5.0,2021-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great machine, I highly recommend it if your looking for high quality espresso. There is a little extra work with clean up etc. but it is very worth it to me. If you use high quality coffee beans the taste is amazing, and the steamer works very well. I can make a cafe latte with this that is much better than what you would get at Starbucks."
1868,5.0,2021-07-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,A truly professional product.
1869,5.0,2020-05-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am really enjoying my Breville Barista Express Espresso. I have had it for about 3 months now and no problems so far. It does require a little bit of learning to use, but is worth it. With just a little practice you too can enjoy a morning (or afternoon) cappucino or latte at home. This is a great little machine which does it all; grinds the beans, brews the espresso, and froths the milk."
1870,4.0,2020-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great entry point into the espresso world. For coffee enthusiasts, you may find yourself wanting more even after a month or so, but I'm still not disappointed for what it is. Beats spending $2k and makes a great cup of coffee."
1871,5.0,2019-07-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,This makes very good espresso especially if you take the time to play with the settings and get the right extraction. that said the dual wall inserts make it easy to use even without too much effort.
1872,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great all around home espresso machine. Pump is louder than usually on the one I got.
1873,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I did not know good Cappuccino until now. Starbucks is so over now.
Follow instructions, they are well written and helpful. Use good beans. Keep it clean and it makes consistently good brews."
1874,5.0,2021-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very well made and really works well. Plenty of steam for the milk.
1875,5.0,2018-11-24, Black Sesame,love this machine... great quality and taste is amazing!!!!
1876,4.0,2020-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,There was something wrong with the expresso handle engaging into the pressure connection. It was extremely difficult to engage.
1877,5.0,2018-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"THIS WAS A LITTLE GIFT I DECIDED TO GIVE TO THE HOUSE AFTER WE MOVED FROM WISCONSIN TO THE WARM WEATHER! i LOVE IT, GREAT QUALITY. YOU MUST CLEAN IT EVERY DAY!
IT IS A LUXURY ITEM SO TREAT IT LIKE ONE; IF YOU ARE OPENING A SMALL COFFEE SHOP OR RESTAURANT I WOULD BE HAPPY IF YOU SERVE ME COFFEE FROM THIS MACHINE!"
1878,5.0,2020-03-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine works as advertised, and the homemade drinks rival that of coffee shops (used skill not included)"
1879,5.0,2021-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I tried a cup of coffee at a friend's house from his 870XL, and was instantly hooked. This machine extracts all of the butterflies and rainbows from your beans and puts them into your cup. Truly exceptional coffee coming out of this machine, and actually, I get best results using inexpensive aribica beans. Though it appears daunting to use at first, you'll find that it's easier to use than your drip coffee maker and with far less waste. One of the best purchases I've made in years."
1880,5.0,2021-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Really good espresso machine. Fun to play with and can make versatile espresso. The manual function allow me to make the perfect espresso with all different kind of beans.
1881,5.0,2019-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,i absolutely love this machine! it makes great espresso and has great features. it allows me to easily adjust the espresso to everyones taste. easy to clean and looks great too. i highly recommend this Breville this is my second Breville the first one worked well for many years. this one is an upgrade and i am glad i went for the upgrade it has been well worth it!
1882,2.0,2021-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this in July, 2020. Since then, I had 3 warranty replacements. Twice the grinder failed, and once the machine’s brew and hot water dispensing became variable and inconsistent. The most recent replacement malfunctioned within 4 days. Breville claims all the replacement machines are new and not refurbished. While I have loved the machine when it worked, the failure rate is untenable. I would not have purchased this machine had I been aware of these problems. Do not recommend."
1883,5.0,2019-11-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine makes great espresso shots and very easy to use. My wife worked in a coffee shop in college with professional machines and she was even impressed with the functionality and quality of shots.
1884,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this coffee maker!! I can't wait to wake up every morning and make me a new cup of coffee. And it's perfect every time!! Starbucks has nothing on it.. I wish the portafilter had a different way to get locked in - sometimes it gets stock un to the top gasket and I have to place it back in place. otherwise it's a great coffee maker.. I use Lavazza medium roast beans and I'm really liking it.
1885,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So glad I bought this machine. Best tasting coffee. Better when you purchase a locally roasted bean. I still haven’t figured out how to keep the steaming wand clean, but other than that I love this machine!"
1886,5.0,2020-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have been using the Breville for about a month and love it!
1887,5.0,2019-11-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you want some control of how you make your coffee oppose to fully automatic machine this one is for you. Cleaning is easy and espresso taste great. For decaf you may need additional grinder, but that about it. Definitely 100% recommend!"
1888,5.0,2020-04-16, Black Sesame,So easy to use! I LOVE it!!!!
1889,5.0,2020-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this to replace the old one I had. It’s the same model, just updated a little. Have used this machine for years and love it. Makes great espresso and in the long run, is cheaper than going to a coffee shop everyday."
1890,5.0,2021-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was iffy on spending the money and thought about a cheaper option, I'm glad I paid a little extra fro this machine."
1891,4.0,2021-07-21, Black Sesame,"Flmy husband loves it! Great machine for the price. Easy to use, and compact size."
1892,5.0,2020-03-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love our Breville. Took a few tries to perfect how we like the espresso made. Do yourself a favor and read the instructions WELL and watch YouTube videos on how to operate before jumping in. We love the product.
1893,5.0,2018-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very good machine that makes amazing coffee. My family has been using them for a few years now and I was finally able to buy one for my own place. Me and my wife are loving it.
1894,5.0,2020-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Awesome product especially at the price. I changed all the filters and have enjoyed great coffee. The streamer works well too for heating milk for hot chocolate or capuccino. I did a lot of research and I'm stoked on this product. I had been in Colombia for a month before making this much needed luxury purchase after enjoying cheap Colombian coffee drinks. Before this, I used a French press. Love the coffee!!!"
1895,5.0,2019-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I USE THIS EVERYDAY! Best purchase I’ve made in years.
1896,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Took a bit of playing around to figure it out
1897,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love, love, love this machine. Everything in one unit. The grinder is easy to use and is very convenient. You don't have to wait for the water to heat up. The crema is wonderful. If you want a bigger cup of coffee, try the two shots followed by a single shot with the same cup full of grind. It's not diluted or bitter at all."
1898,5.0,2020-07-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my Barista Express! I've had it for a couple of months now and just use it on weekend to make iced vanilla lattes. It's super easy to use and clean. I'm not a professional barista so I can't speak to how well it performs against more expensive machines or how well you can pull shots from it, but as a regular dude I can tell you it's incredibly simple to reproduce something you'd spend $5 on at Starbucks."
1899,5.0,2021-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is the best appliance in my kitchen, I am in love with it. Grinder works perfectly grinding those coffee beans for that fresh coffee shop taste of espresso right in your home! Perfectly executed espresso machine for home use!"
1900,1.0,2021-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I hate giving one star to this product because of one issue but I must. Once you have a loaded the machine is awesome. The problem is that the coffee gets stuck in the hopper and doesn't fall into the grinder. The grinder, having no way of knowing this runs, for the predetermined time thinking there is coffee there to grind. The result is an inconsistent dose of coffee. Without a consistent amount of coffee, you can't get the coffee tamped consistently (or at all if the amount of coffee is below the top of the portafilter) and it's down hill from there. If there were a stirrer in the hopper so you could be sure beans didn't get stuck falling into the grinder so it could do its job; this would be a killer machine.
The other features are incredibly well thought out; especially the feature that removes excess water from the filter basket after coffee extraction, so the used grounds form a dry puck for quicker cleanup is incredible.
I tried about $100 on 8 different coffees; some oily, some not so much and some in between but this did not seem to matter as far as the coffees' just needing a stir in the hopper every 4 brews or so.
For this reason I have to award only one star; you can't count on it working. If you like to tinker with stuff; you may not mind this; but I get up at 4:00am and my short patience level rules that out. Sadly, returning the machine."
1901,5.0,2019-11-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect coffee machine. I loved it so much.
1902,5.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 Pros:
- Makes consistent espresso.
- Heats up liquid really fast and gets quite hot.
- Removable Bean Hopper and Water Reservoir
- Magnetic Tamper
- Pressure Gauge for instant feedback
- Stainless Steel Design

Cons:
- There's a learning curve.
- Can be overwhelming at first. Lot of knobs and buttons to dial in your ideal settings.
- Gets a little messy (coffee grinds, frothing splatter, emptying the tray, etc). Clean up takes time."
1903,5.0,2016-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s like having a professional machine at home. Grinder built in for ease. Takes a few grinds to find your niche for the perfect cup. So easy to use and feel like your a professional barista. Excellent machine. Couldn’t be any lore happy about my purchase. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality machine. Do not hesitate to buy - 100% worth every penny.
1904,5.0,2020-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a great espresso! Haven’t tried the steamer or foamier yet but so far love the machine. For new users you do need to read through the directions though to understand the grinding and flow ratio.
1905,4.0,2020-02-02, Black Sesame,"No dual voltage capability. Must have 220v as well.
Grinder cleaning is a tough task.
Excellent personal coffee machine"
1906,5.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I feel like a total Barista in my own home. ""Pulling"" a cup of espresso and the related varieties of drinks is now a bit of a hobby, and this machine works great. Feels like a professional machine (very nicely manufactured) but the size is manageable and fits nicely on my bar. Apart from having to learn (thanks to YouTube) how to make espresso, this machine has worked great. It does take practice getting the puck in properly, but both single and double-walled inserts are included so the beginner can have some satisfaction.

Have fun!"
1907,3.0,2017-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Having some problems, but was so happy to have it I didn't do anything from the onset, which I should have. Steamer doesn't heat up so it's hard to make steamed milk. Over and over, I have to keep running through the heat up process. Now, 7 months into it, the espresso won't extract high enough. I have cleaned the machine as directed when the light came on. I have tried many options of troubleshooting. I have tried to raise the degrees. Extraction will not jump to proper level now, even though it used to do it correctly. I'm disappointed. My friend paid full price from Williams Sonoma and hers works fine every single time."
1908,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My first espresso machine was the basic, bottom line one. One of my biggest reasons for upgrading is that I didn't like the time it took to put the coffee in the filter basket and then have to clean it out every day. Then I upgraded to Villa Spidem, which I've used to 7-8 years and loved it. It's very easy to use. It grinds the beans and the espresso comes out and the used coffee dumps in a container that you empty once a week or so. I would just get another one of these, but I couldn't find one (though looking closer it looks similar to a Saeco Vienna Plus). When I got the Breville Barista I so disappointed to read the operating instructions that I never took it out of the box. It has a coffee grinder built in, but you still have to fill up the filter basket and attach it, then dump it out after use. I don't understand why you would spend the extra money for the built in grinder if you have to do this step. It didn't even occur to me to check for this before purchasing, because I thought all machines with a grinder would have this feature. You are increasing the chances it breaks down and not simplifying the process."
1909,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Absolutely love my new coffee machine. All family and friends love and enjoy cappuccinos. Had to buy extra milk as we now drink cappuccino every morning!
1910,4.0,2021-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes great espresso coffee, just havinga hard time finding the best setting to grain."
1911,5.0,2019-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Don’t hesitate and buy it. The coffee tastes so good and it’s easy to use. I saved a lot of money by making my coffee at home
1912,5.0,2018-11-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,No more waiting in line for my morning cappuccino - would definitely recommend buying this machine
1913,5.0,2018-07-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have the machine for nearly a month - and perfectly happy with it. Just after a few (failed) tries and we managed to make great coffee with all the creamy and right in the ""espresso range"" pressure. Making espresso now is very enjoyable and easy. The steam is a little bit under-powered - would take a few minute to heat up 16oz of milk - but it is reasonable for this price range. Strong recommendation!"
1914,5.0,2021-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,An all in one espresso dream machine. It’s become my morning habit. Love it
1915,5.0,2021-04-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love my espresso machine! Love that the grinder is attached, easy to use and easy enough to clean. My husband's workplace has one in their kitchen that is used by A LOT of people and it has held up fantastically! Top rated by everyone in the office."
1916,5.0,2020-06-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"love it! use it every morning! it is my treat of the day. It requires some adjustment and learning to get used to the machine, but it is also the fun part of crafting coffee."
1917,5.0,2020-06-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Who says you can’t be your own barista!? Wether your wanting a latte, espresso, Americana, cappuccino, or whatever you fancy. This makes a delicious cup o’ joe! Also the machine and parts feel well made to last."
1918,5.0,2016-05-15, Black Sesame,"So far we absolutely love it. We had a little lower grade espresso machine for a while that we used every day for a couple years until it died on us. We decided to replace it with this machine. The lattes we can make are so good and frothy. Starbucks does not taste that good anymore :)
A tip: those of you who like more natural foods, replace syrup with Organic Agave Nectar. It is so delicious in a latte!"
1919,5.0,2017-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is with the money! Amazing product that works extremely well. Very easy to set up. I use it multiple times a day. I am so glad i made this purchase.
1920,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,My wife and I agonized over what to buy. This was our choice and we are very happy with it. It came with everything that is needed except water and beans.
1921,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use and easy to keep clean. Makes great coffee highly recommend
1922,3.0,2020-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,that was $600 wasted. machine started leaking after less than a year use. replaced the ring - only helped for another week. Gave up on customer service after being on hold for over an hour
1923,5.0,2020-11-30, Black Sesame,"Absolutely love this machine! My brother has the identical machine and whenever I go visit him I make myself a cappuccino. I could never quite bring myself to spend 500+ on a coffee maker, but after 2 years of denying myself the machine I finally splurged and got it for my birthday. Its AMAZING and makes delicious espresso, cappuccino, latte, etc. If you can afford it get it, you won't regret it!"
1924,2.0,2021-05-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,This item was was sold as new. It was not as it was not in its original box and was clearly a scratch and dent item. It was shipped by Amazon in a plain brown box with a wad of accessories wrapped in plastic. It had a sticker that said something along the lines of thank you for giving this item a new life. The filter pod that I first used wouldn't come back out of the machine without being gently pried out. I had to use a filter pod from my old machine to get it in and out properly. The only good news is that with a proper filter pod the machine is running OK........for now.
1925,3.0,2020-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The grinder has never worked. I've followed the cleaning instruction twice thinking perhaps that would fix it but no. The grinder sounds like it's working but nothing comes out. Also the clean me light comes on once a month. Kind of a pain but I clean it every time.
Using a separate grinder I've managed to grind the coffee to the level required to produce a perfect cup of espresso. This machine requires a finer grind than a store coffee grinder set on espresso can produce. All that said the espresso part of the machine works very well.

You would think if one spends $700 on a espresso machine it would work completely. The grinder not working just pisses me off. Trying to get the problem fixed is even more infuriating."
1926,5.0,2020-05-27, Black Sesame,I love this machine make my days better!
1927,5.0,2021-07-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday, we’ve been using it now for a few months and it’s amazingggg. I worked as a barista a few years ago when I was in school and I can honestly say this product it is great. It even comes with stickers of the labels in French for those francophones. You can just see the quality when you use it."
1928,5.0,2019-04-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We recently upgraded from a basic DeLonghi espresso machine and are SO happy with our purchase. We are by no means expert baristas and find this machine to be very user-friendly. Once we got the settings dialed in, we were good to go and have been enjoying delicious espresso! We find the machine to be very consistent. Trips to Starbucks are a thing of the past and our Breville is already saving us money!"
1929,5.0,2017-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It has worked well for us. Had it about 6 months. I have had to clean it once, and descale it once. Was easy to do and they included the cleaning pod/package for first time cleaning. Espressos are really good once you get the hang of it. Took us a few weeks to get the right grind size, amount, press."
1930,5.0,2022-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it!!! Previously had a nespresso machine and hated how expensive and wasteful the pods were getting. This amazing espresso machine now gives my husband his favorite espresso in the morning without having to leave the house or having to spend a lot! Saves us lots of money and time. Well worth it, and so cool looking in our kitchen!"
1931,4.0,2020-04-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My old Breville Espresso Machine was entirely warped in stainless steel, even in the back. This one has plastic on top and in the back. I am concerned that with frequent cleaning top will get ruined quickly."
1932,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've previously owned a Sunbeam EM5900 and more lately a Gaggia Classic, both with a Sunbeam EM0480 grinder. The steam wand on the BES870XL produces a similar high quality micro-foam as compared to the EM5900 which is far superior to the Gaggia Classic. However, the quality of the coffee shot is also on par with the EM5900 which is far inferior to the Gaggia Classic. I've dialed in about six different beans, with mixed results, but the best coffee shot I've so far had from the BES870XL only glimpses at the voluminous explosion of crema that was quite easily attainable from the Gaggia Classic. If I had the choice again, I would look at alternative options."
1933,3.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,After a little more than a year it has a faulty o-ring and or other issues and leaks water on my countertop. Shortly there after it continuously trips GFCI outlets in the kitchen. After trying the machine in different outlets and at my neighbors home the problem lies within the machine itself. Contacted Breville a few weeks back and still have yet to receive a response or rectify the situation.
1934,5.0,2020-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've owned this espresso machine since 2017. I used it every day to make the best cappuccino EVER. Love all about it
1935,1.0,2019-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As a Christmas gift, I bought this coffee machine in December 2019, and bought a 3-year warranty. The machine itself comes with a one-year warranty, but it broke in May 2020. I tried several times with Contact the manufacturer, the phone they provide can be reached, but there is no one to answer after waiting for about an hour, wasting a lot of my time, because I bought the 3-year insurance provided by Amazon, so Amazon can refund me, but need A handling fee of approximately USD 30 is charged. I bought some of the supporting facilities of this coffee machine and they are no longer useful. If I want to continue to use these supporting equipment, I can only buy another same coffee machine because the size of the grinding bowl of the coffee machine is special. Now the price of this coffee machine has increased again. If I buy the same coffee machine again, it will cost more than 100 US dollars and there is no coffee for about 20 days during the return and purchase process. This is a problem of product quality. Why should I let I'll take it! ! Very angry 😡"
1936,5.0,2019-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the best money I’ve spent and best bang for the buck. Buy the 4 year warranty and enjoy perfect espresso every single day worry free. You’re welcome.
1937,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine.
1938,5.0,2019-05-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use and convenient. Saves on going and buying 8 dollar Americanos. Only wish the water reservoir was bigger. Little on the expensive side, but was well worth it having the included grinder."
1939,5.0,2016-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This product is definitely worth the price. Great extraction, easy to care for, coffee tastes GREAT, also visually such an eye candy to look at everyday. I feel happy just to see it in my kitchen. Very well made product. Compactor is solid stainless steel, so conveniently stored with magnet! Love the function, design, engineering.
Buy it, you won't regret."
1940,5.0,2020-12-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great!!!!!!!
1941,5.0,2018-09-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine for my husband as a birthday gift and he just loves it since he’s a coffee freak. The only thing he doesn’t like from it is how fast he has to refill the water in the back, other than that it’s a great machine."
1942,5.0,2021-02-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've gone through several low-budget quality Espresso Makers and regret each one of them. This is the machine I should have shelled out for the begin with. A little maintenance and cleaning now and then and its pumping out god-like shots of Espresso in no time. Every aspect of the machine was well designed and thought out. Even the magnetic tamper is genius!
1943,1.0,2019-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had 2 replacements required within 60 days.

The first machine arrived and had an internal electrical issue where the machine would quickly power on and off. The second machine arrived and I was able to make espresso for about 3 weeks before the milk wand began having issues. I would allow the machine to heat for about an hour each morning before pulling a shot. Once the wand was activated, there was about a 50/50 chance of it actually producing steam. The wand would either shoot a little water out as it heated and then begin to steam, only to shut back off a few seconds after placing in the milk, shooting a flow of water into the milk, or it would never begin to steam and just provide a steady flow of water out of the tip. It seems like the steam/watwr switch on the side of the machine has issues where it won’t fully engage the steam setting.

This has been extremely frustrating to deal with for a $700 item. You could pay much less for a keurig and have equally crappy espresso."
1944,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Loved this machine for the first week. Then the pressure gauge started steaming up and the needle doesn't move. Still makes espresso but not sure operation is optimum. Going to try cleaning to see if gauge function returns. Otherwise coming back to you.
1945,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,I just got my machine today and I absolutely LOVE it! My first try came out PERFECT! I am so glad that I took the plunge!
1946,3.0,2020-05-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After about 4 months of use, the grinder quits working, so I returned the machine. It made a weird noise when grinding and no matter what setting I chose, it produced very fine coffee which made the machine work too hard to produce the proper drip. Overall, the machine is solid however it does not meet my expectation in term of the quality of the espresso. The milk steamer did not produce the consistent pressure I was looking for. It might be just me expecting too much for the machine in this price range. I am really happy the way Amazon handles the return, it reflects the high quality of service!"
1947,5.0,2020-07-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Working from home with handmake coffee everyday, my dream come true. The machine is high quality product, i wish would bought it earlier."
1948,5.0,2021-03-09, Black Sesame,"Bought on prime day, it's worth the price. My wife used it every morning"
1949,5.0,2020-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The only complaint I have is how long it takes to steam my milk, but the steam it does produces is great!"
1950,2.0,2019-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After having the espresso maker for about 6 months it started failing to pressurize. After literal hours on the phone with breville they emailed a youtube video on pressure tests. The unit failed them. Instead honoring the warranty and replacing it, they sent me a large list of repair chores. More things to buy that aren't guaranteed to fix the problem. Interestingly, many of those chores should have been in the manual since, apparently, the unit doesn't work if you don't do those things. Too much complexity. Too little reliability. Not worth hundreds of dollars."
1951,4.0,2021-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this espresso machine. We previously had a rancilio machine that we'd had for a bit. It made a great cup of coffee, but was inconsistent. I researched new machines and liked the reviews on this one, particularly as it is a double boiler machine. It works very well and makes a great, consistent cup of coffee. The one drawback is that it seems to ""waste"" coffee."
1952,1.0,2020-06-17, Black Sesame,"I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift. Luckily, he knew how to operate it easily. However, there is an issue with the pressure gauge, it never ever rises. I called the Breville about this issue, they told me I need to change the coffee beans and try again. I'm confused on why not all coffee beans will work on this machine? (Sorry, but I might be a newb on this). We used the Lavazza Super Crema Espresso, as I saw it is very popular on amazon. Anyway, we will try to buy different coffee beans and see if it'll work out. I will update my review accordingly.

------- UPDATE

I went and bought the EXACT coffee beans that our local Breville store uses to adjust pressure gauge. And guess what, it did not work. The pressure gauge did increase a bit than before, but not all the way up. I am so disappointed and frustrated with this purchase. I am currently working on returning it, but I will be losing almost all my money since this machine is very heavy and its transport cost is very expensive. (I do not live in the USA, that's why).

----------UPDATE

I ended up returning this item to amazon. I was so happy that amazon covered all the shipping costs and I got a full refund on this item. VERY happy with Amazon's service."
1953,5.0,2020-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is very well built, coffee comes out wonderfully flavorful, cleaning is easy, best purchase in a long time. The burr grinder is little harder to clean, but doable if you check instructions."
1954,5.0,2021-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Got it for my wife's birthday....she uses it every day and after learning the proper grind size and packing strength, we always get consistent pressure and flavor. Overall it's a great sturdy machine and after daily usage for over a month, it still works great!!!

PS: This machine needs practice and precise grind size and packing pressure. Just practice and also set your own extract time. normal double shot seems to be 25 seconds. We programed it to 30 and it's the perfect amount."
1955,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,So so happy I finally pulled the trigger on this after debating it for a couple of years. Don’t be scared! You can do it! Make coffee great again! Buy one!
1956,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,Good professional product for at home use. Love the convenience of putting in whatever coffee beans I want instead of stale pods.
1957,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's good and works fine. But it's really loud and it's does not work to foam the milk at the same time as you're waiting for the espresso to finish. Which I think is very weird. Having a two year experience as a Barista it surprised me. Especially after all the good ratings about it.
Another thing I find weird. I can't take the filter off that keeps the coffee powder from falling into the cup. Meaning I can't clean it properly, and I'm not used to this type of brand either so I wanted to read the instructions on how to clean it, but the instructions is a little bit vague."
1958,5.0,2019-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine! Great crema on shots & steams milk nicely.
1959,5.0,2020-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this Breville espresso machine! I use it minimum several times every day. It's already saved me a lot of money not going to Starbucks! The drinks are every bit as good as the coffee shop. My go to is the caramel macchiato. This maker will pay for itself in 6 months or less. I highly recommend this Breville.
1960,5.0,2019-10-29, Black Sesame,"If I’m in a rush, I can make a fresh cup of espresso in less then 3 minutes and that’s including the machines warmup time. A clean, user friendly design so that anyone can use with ease."
1961,5.0,2017-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 Love this so much!!!!!
I super enjoy my coffee now!"
1962,5.0,2021-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Whay can I say? I love this espresso machine! Already one month since I bought it, no issues, haven't spend anymore money at any major coffee places ... looking forward to many more years enjoying this Barista machine!"
1963,5.0,2018-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is AWESOME! I use it every day, making my wife and I espresso's, Latte's, and other coffees. Excellent machine all around. Easy to operate, maintain, and clean!"
1964,5.0,2020-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very fast and easy if you have used one before
1965,5.0,2020-06-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,It took 3-5 tries to figure out the right amount and coarse level to get it right but I’m loving this machine!
1966,5.0,2020-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,amazing. Worth every penny. very solid build. Makes great expresso
1967,5.0,2019-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,This takes a little trial and error to figure out your best extraction but that isn't any more than any other true espresso machine. The grinder is great and it yields a very strong espresso with great crema.
1968,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine a little over priced for what it is
1969,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Fácil de usar
1970,5.0,2019-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Simply fantastic. As others have said, just dig in and know you'll waste a few in order to sort out the settings. In 15 minutes- it was dialed in to my liking and rocks! The ""instant"" water heater inside staggers the mind with how quickly (and how hot) it heats the water in no time.

Update; had this for 2 years now, still loving it! Probably had three friends buy one for themselves, after seeing this thing in motion. Just great!"
1971,3.0,2021-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machined worked well for a year, then the grinder had a problem. Filling in the online support form is impossible since the Amazon order number does not match Breville's required number of digits. So, I am stuck, and cannot get a human being to answer the phone."
1972,5.0,2020-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Second purchase for a second home. Would have loved to buy the red but it wouldn't go well. The black looks nicer than the stainless in my opinion. But most importantly, works very well. Of course you have to find your favorite coffee and use trial and error to you find the brew you want but that is the whole point of having one of these."
1973,1.0,2019-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I can’t even speak for the machine itself because we didn’t get to use it. I bought it as a gift for my parents anniversary, gave it to them, and we were so excited to try it out we immediately opened it to set it up. Well, imagine our surprise when we take it out to see that it was used! It was dented and scratched up and there were grains inside of it! We immediately put it back in the box to return. I don’t think I can take a chance on buying something like this again on Amazon. Hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else!"
1974,5.0,2020-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"works great, I love it and has made my mornings so much nicer."
1975,5.0,2020-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee machine if you are into coffee this is your perfect match.You can buy your coffee beans grinder yourself.Make sure to watch a couples of videos though.Not so easy to use. Thought i find i a lil bit pricey
1976,5.0,2021-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to follow start guide for troubleshooting
1977,4.0,2021-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've used this machine for about two months now and it works great. Easy to set up, and easy to use. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not perfect, and the reason is because the filters get stuck from time to time otherwise it works without a flaw."
1978,5.0,2019-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to set up, easy to use and great latte's!"
1979,5.0,2020-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel, Súper!!
1980,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Really like it. The only thing I can’t figure out is how to get the auto grind to grind the right amount of coffee. Solid machine.
1981,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love my coffee maker. Easy to use and easy to clean. My husband purchased the machine only 2 months ago I hope I can keep it for a long time without any problems.
1982,5.0,2019-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love our machine so much, it brings style to the countertop, it works smoothly.
This is our second one from the same brand and we are still in love with brand and the machine.
Would absolutely recommend"
1983,5.0,2019-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I DONT HAVE TO GO FOR ESPRESSO ANYMORE.
1984,5.0,2020-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am in love with this machine! Sooo worth the money to be able to treat myself every single morning to an amazing cappuccino.
1985,5.0,2018-06-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,2 months in and this is definitely an amazing machine. Never had a problem with the quality of coffee or the machine. Make sure to use fresh beans to avoid issues reaching that proper espresso range.
1986,5.0,2020-05-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,We’ve had this machine for a while and this makes great coffee. Very rich and high quality coffee that also has a grinder built in.
1987,5.0,2022-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,The coffee is delicious but you have to resist the temptation to make a triple or quadruple shot because you think there is too little coffee. The double shot barely gives one inch of coffee in your cup and then you add cream or milk. It is the perfect amount.
1988,5.0,2021-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works flawlessly once you dial it in to your preferences.
1989,5.0,2022-05-18, Black Sesame,We love it! Best coffee drink ever! We have used it daily since purchasing!
1990,5.0,2021-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a perfect step up from the sub $200 espresso makers. The ability to grind your own shot, control the amount ground, and the fact it comes with both single and double walled baskets is great! The steam wand is marvelous, but takes a while to get use to for the perfect foam pour."
1991,5.0,2021-07-02, Black Sesame,Love love love this machine ... more importantly love the taste we get from our beans ... way better than our previous automatic machine
1992,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,Amazon has the best price and this is a good machine!
1993,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,A friend recommended this and I have enjoyed this product tremendously. I bought one for my brother and he enjoys very much. Well made. Make a beautiful espresso and latte. Great price for the quality. I never enjoyed a cup of coffee this much ever. Highly recommend.
1994,5.0,2018-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve used the same local roaster’s beans in at least 3 other machines over the years but this Breville produces a cappuccino as good as any I’ve had in Italy. Thick crema and froth that is more like meringue than steamed milk. Easy to use and fast. Pricey but I would recommend it to any serious espresso lover. Very pleased -5 stars!
1995,5.0,2019-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,We were looking for an espresso machine that was powerful enough to push the steamer through a tightly packed portafilter basket. This one has the power and makes very rich espresso.
1996,5.0,2021-04-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am so used to things breaking in a year or so. I've had this 2.5 years and have had no problems with it.
1997,5.0,2019-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"You need to carefully read the instructions for this machine to get the most out of it. However, once you do you will not be disappointed in the results."
1998,5.0,2020-12-30, Black Sesame,Easy to use. Lots of info on YouTube
1999,5.0,2020-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,It's as great as advertised. Great home expresso machine.
2000,4.0,2021-04-26, Black Sesame,Very good
2001,5.0,2021-05-16, Black Sesame,So far so good
2002,1.0,2019-05-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,During routine cleaning and descaling I found that one of the screws in the water tank wasn’t stainless and that I have been drinking rust in my water opposed to filtered water as the rust was under the piece that the filter hooks into.
2003,5.0,2019-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this for my fiance for a holiday gift and he said it was the best gift he's ever received. We use it multiple times a day. This machine is amazing!!!
2004,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,What a great machine. All-in-one capabilities make this the only coffee machine I'll ever need. Certainly worth the investment before medical school!!
2005,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is my fourth one. We use them in my cafe. We love them.
2006,5.0,2017-03-20, Black Sesame,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it
2007,5.0,2018-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I'ts easy to use. Perfect size. Excellent machine.
2008,5.0,2021-07-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this after hearing about it from friends who love theirs. This is a wonderful espresso machine. High quality construction, easy to use, and makes great coffee."
2009,5.0,2020-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine! At first it seemed like it was going to be complicated to figure it out. It is totally easy to use. They include a quick start guide that is all you need to be making expresso with in minutes. And the taste, OH MY WORD!! I now have a shot added to every cup of coffee I make."
2010,1.0,2014-03-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The grinder definitely requires some improvements. First of all, it is not easy to use, especially with scales for measuring the ground coffee weigh for a shot, and a funnel. So, the grinding process is really messy. It is better to have a dedicated grind button on the panel rather than running the grinder with a portafilter.

Used this machine for a month. The first day I received it I had to adjust the burr settings from the factory-default at 6 to 3 because otherwise, it was impossible to get fine enough ground coffee for espresso (using 18g ground coffee in a portafilter you should be able to receive 36g liquid drink in a cup in approx. 25-35 seconds of extraction. In opposite case you have the wrong grinder settings).

After a month of usage, the grinder stopped providing constant results. I had to configure it finer and finer each day because each time after a few shots it started providing too coarse grind.

Finally, returned it back.

PS: The steamer is also not of good quality. The steam is not constant and mixed with water at the end of steaming even for the first latte in the morning. Steam power is poor."
2011,5.0,2018-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Got one of the Amazon Warehouse deals on the Breville Barista Express and it was a great way to save money on a fantastic machine! I couldn't even find the scratch that the description said was the issue with my particular machine.

Machine was easy to use and I pulled my first shot of espresso within 10 minutes of unboxing. So easy to use!"
2012,5.0,2014-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had a Breville espresso machine several years ago, but this one has a Burr grinder and options for making espresso. I did waste about 1/2lb of coffee getting the grind and amount of coffees just right, but now I realize how easy it is."
2013,5.0,2019-10-02, Black Sesame,"I've been using this machine for over 2 months. It makes good coffee and very easy to use it. I would say that it's noisy but nothing unbearable. Cleaning it's fairly easy , not big of deal."
2014,2.0,2021-05-27, Black Sesame,"Fair espresso if you are not accustomed to good.
The grinder needs to be set one notch below finest with good fresh coffee for proper extraction according to the gauge on the machine. The flavor is bitter probably due to the grinder, but who knows.
There is little to no control over the steam unlike prosumer machines. There is no control over extraction or temperature of espresso unlike many machines. All I all I may buy a better machine like the Silvia pay more, but get good espresso at home."
2015,5.0,2021-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have had this machine for almost 2 years now and it’s has worked great. I have made on average 3 espresso drinks a day and it has work flawlessly the whole time.
2016,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worth the money, love the coffee"
2017,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,We did our research on this unit and read almost every review! We are so happy with it... since Xmas we have saved over $400 that we would have didn’t on the driveup coffee stands. ❤️ You won’t regret getting this... but prepare to pour a little more into accessories which are well worth it!
2018,4.0,2020-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,The espresso maker is very consistent and customizable. There is only a minor annoyance. The filter sticks to the machine when left for an extended period after brewing.
2019,5.0,2020-06-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Simply perfect! Everything you need for your best home made cappuccino.
2020,5.0,2021-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it works great
2021,5.0,2020-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,My mom says the caramel macchiatos I make for her are better than the ones from Starbucks. I love this machine!! I’ve only had it less than 24 hours and I’ve saved $20! It’s very easy to use and clean. Now to find out what coffee beans I like more 😁
2022,5.0,2021-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,For that price it is very good. My first try didn't go so hot so I reread the directions and my 2 shot latte was sooooo good. Like weak knee good. This is way bigger and much more complex then my $40 Brentwood that broke Monday. I love sugary lattes so the price is worth it to me. Put some Peets in there and holy cow..... better than Starbucks.
2023,5.0,2020-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great home espresso machine. There is a bit of a learning curve if you are new to making espresso.
2024,5.0,2017-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,First Espresso machine I've owned and so far my girlfriend and I love it. It works great with our Vitamix to make afternoon fraps!
2025,4.0,2020-07-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,After a day of use I can say I am very satisfied with the simplicity/quality of this machine. I have yet to fine tune the proper combination of grind size/volume/tamp pressure. But once I have that figured out I'm sure the product will earn a 5th star. The grinder is one of the best I've used so far. Finest grind I've ever had
2026,5.0,2020-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Did everything promised
2027,5.0,2014-05-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the second one we bought as a gift. This machine is simple and produces a great shot and very good hot foam. You can't get better for the money.
2028,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Stunned at how good an espresso this machine makes!

Right out of the box barely and reading the manual, I made a two shot and it was as good as anything the big box coffee guys serve you. I will try to tweak the grind and strength but I am impressed.

PS- Someone please remove ""expresso"" from the title or the trailer park people will think that is the correct pronunciation!"
2029,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,quality is great. Easy to use. Best machine you can buy. Perfect for entertaining
2030,5.0,2021-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We use it for our church, were a small congregation, we love it"
2031,5.0,2020-03-22, Black Sesame,"Once I figured out that dry beans are necessary for appropriate pressures when making espresso. As well as the grind size of the bean. It uses a lot of water and builds up quickly so I drain it out and wipe it clean every few uses. It's beautiful, and my favorite birthday gift from myself I've ever given/received"
2032,4.0,2021-03-07, Black Sesame,I have had this machine for 2 weeks. I started with Illy- dark roast ground coffee and it produced a consistently tasty cup. Yesterday I started with grinding beans. Here we start to have challenges. Inconsistent pressure with all of the preset grinds. This is for a dedicated fiddler. I hope I can get there
2033,5.0,2021-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this espresso machine after a trip over to Europe. I read the main issues with this machine and luckily (knock on wood)) it will not have any issues like prior buyers!
2034,5.0,2021-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 For what I needed is more than perfect 👌🏻"
2035,5.0,2021-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing machine! I love this!
2036,5.0,2020-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes great coffee. It nearly makes a barista out of anyone. Takes a little time to get used to but after the initial learning curve it is great.
2037,3.0,2021-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After several times experimenting with the grinding size and amount, we were finally able to make a perfect cup within the espresso range.
It's been a couple months of use and are unhappy with the filter getting stuck in the group head every time we use it. I have to turn it to pull it out and the filter stays stuck in the head. I put it back on and twist it at least three times before it comes loose.
Now I don't seem to be able to connect with the seller to remedy the issue. Not sure I would purchase again."
2038,5.0,2019-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Took me some time to properly learn how to use the machine and pull the best shots but once I did its amazing.
2039,5.0,2014-12-28, Black Sesame,Llegó muy bien y a tiempo. Luego de usarla haré un review completo.
2040,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love our Breville!! It’s a great investment!! Our Keurig hasn’t been used ever since we got our espresso machine. We use it almost everyday and it’s a great addition to our coffee corner.
2041,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I don't even drink coffee, but she does and everybody's mornings are perfect since I received this unit."
2042,5.0,2021-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've really enjoyed this so far, works as advertised and makes some damn good espresso. The steam wand takes a bit to get going sometimes and dribbles out water initially, but I think that's normal and part of the process. If it stays working and is a reliable product I will definitely be buying the model above this years from now!"
2043,5.0,2018-08-03, Black Sesame,Nothing less then perfect.
2044,1.0,2017-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Our first brewing attempt resulted in no coffee. The manual indicated over-extraction as the cause, so we adjusted the setting, after which the grinder clogged and jammed completely. We called ""customer service"" for a week (!) with no representative answering. We twice left our number for a call-back, but no call-backs came. The manual described a fix for jamming that involved dismantling parts. At this point, unable to get help, we returned the unit."
2045,5.0,2021-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Seriously the best investment. Works GREAT
2046,5.0,2016-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For a small office or home use, good product. It takes awhile to dial it in for the best pull. Take your time. We ended up calling the factory and they were very helpful in giving type not shared in the instruction manual."
2047,4.0,2022-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love it so far, it’s awesome to learn how to make good expresso itself, we do not know how long it will work but you don’t need to stay in line to get Starbucks or whatever expresso"
2048,4.0,2020-07-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really nice machine, my only real issue is that the front steel scratches very easily. Just by laying the grinds holder or milk cup it scratches."
2049,1.0,2020-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Updated 7/4/18: Unit stopped working. Not even a year. Cleaned it regularly. Now the clean me LED doesn't function. Was pulling 1 double shot once a day since I purchased it September 2017. Now the machine won't make pressure. The one shot two shot function doesn't work. I have to manually stop it. What a waste of $500.
___
Burning smell after the machine is turned on. The amount of water used by the machine for a double espresso has increased. Resetting the machine doesn't work. Programming the machine doesn't work either. The BES870XL is not even a year old. Removing 2 stars.
Updated 6/4/2018
__
I love this machine. Before September 7, I knew nothing about espresso. Today, I still know nothing. But I do know how to pull a great double shot using the Breville BES870XL. Took me a while figure it out, but once I did _ I'm in espresso heaven. There are a total of 5 bars, including the bars at the beginning and end of grey area marking the espresso zone. I get the pressure up to the 3rd and 4th bar with the grind setting at 6 and the grind amount a bit under the half hour mark (more like 25 minutes after). I use Death Wish beans, Valhalla Java Odinforce beans, Koffee Kult beans, and Lavazza beans. Keep it clean when requested."
2050,5.0,2021-07-16, Black Sesame,We like it so far. It is very nice
2051,2.0,2020-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I gave it two starts based on $ amount spent, time spent on maintenance and cleaning the mess.And cost to repair after one year.
For features/design, I would do a 4 star.

I used it lightly. Twice a day for few months...then once daily.
It broke in 9 months. I did the periodic maintenance steps as per Manuel.

Contacted customer service.
Issue 1: No ground coffee coming from grinder. I had to perform advanced cleaning for the conical burr grinder. Based on manuel, I did that twice but issue not resolved. Customer service is telling me to use coffee that is <30 days old. I use Costco Starbucks beans but, was told to get fresh beans. Also, they had me re-calibrate, after that it works with same old Costco Starbucks beans.

Issue 2: some times water is leaking [for this one, customer service asked me to replace the silicone seal. I will order that today and try].

After one year...If you were to mail it out for a tune up, it would cost $239 plus shipping.
Overall its a lot of maintenance work!!"
2052,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it as soon as I can master it. I put off buying this for many years then went into a small coffee bar in Tennessee where the barista was actually making espresso's using this little guy. I was sold when I had my first shot. And I've gotta add, this guy was using 8 O'Clock espresso beans. Go figure!"
2053,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this espresso machine! I bet I've made my money back by avoiding coffee cafes.

One thing I would change is the milk steamer. Its slow to warm the milk but in the end its worth the wait."
2054,5.0,2021-01-25, Black Sesame,So far this is the best espresso machine i've ever had. I love the fact that is has a grinder so you could make fresh specialty coffee. The taste of lattee and from outside cafes are pretty similar. This is worth to buy item. and i never regret that i bought this espresso machine. This feels like having a coffee shop in your house. Highly recommended!
2055,5.0,2017-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Buenísimo espresso
2056,5.0,2020-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Everything I ever wanted in an espresso machine. Took about 40 shots to get the grind and dosage correct, but once you do this makes an incredible espresso. The attached grinder is such a great addition to this machine. I cannot say enough good things about this. This is by way the best wedding gift a coffee lover can receive."
2057,5.0,2021-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best Espresso Maker !!!
2058,5.0,2021-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes great lattes
2059,5.0,2022-08-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a great cup of coffee!!!
2060,5.0,2018-03-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Nothing better. Gives you manual control to extract the best shots.
Love this. Clean the portafilter after every shot. Descale it every 60 days and run the clean cycle monthly. Keeps things fresh."
2061,5.0,2016-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,I roast my own beans and have made espresso for years. I finally bought this (more expensive) machine. The taste of the espresso is much better than the DeLongi I had before. It does take some practice to get it right. I suggest looking at the YouTube videos out there.
2062,4.0,2021-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso machine for the price -- grinder is not the best
2063,5.0,2020-11-18, Black Sesame,"What can i say? I finally have my allongées (if you’re from Quebec, you’ll know what I’m talking about). The quality is all excellent. I would maybe only improve how fast it steams the milk. Otherwise, do not hesitate- it’s worth it’s weight in gold!"
2064,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The frother did not work on mine and made a screeching sound. Tried 5 cups, none turned out."
2065,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I Love this machine!!! It took my partner and I about a week to figure out the machine. We sacrificed a bag of beans for experimentation, but it was worth it!"
2066,1.0,2020-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am a barista.
Espresso quality was subpar and did not improve from any adjustment (grind size, amount, bean type, tamp pressure, etc...) Pressure gauge was either stuck or the machine just didn't have proper pressure. I wasn't happy with the steam wand as it did not create the micro-foam it should have. The milk produced was bubbly, and remember I am a barista so I know how to foam milk. Even though Amazon makes returns as easy as possible, it is still a pain to lug this machine to the UPS store, and I had to buy new packaging which cost $15. Also, there was the cost of my time and effort in the unpackaging and setting up, the disappointment of it not working, trouble shooting with whomever helped me (I went through the steps on the Amazon return procedure for this item), and now having to start the process over again and find another machine that hopefully WILL work."
2067,5.0,2021-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent Machine. It delivers a really good coffee! Recommended. The quality of expresso coffe equals any professional coffee shop. Price and construction quality are good. Breville have good support and accesories for this machine. I'm very happy.
2068,5.0,2019-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! No more going to Starbucks!
2069,1.0,2014-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I ordered this unit in August and had a great ... 9 months with it. But this machine is incredibly sensitive to the grind of the coffee, so when the hopper broke .. it's almost useless. I tried grinding the beans in a vitamix, making it look a little like the griders results .. and I got coffee flavored water out of my espresso maker. Under grind it .. and you're lucky to get 10 drips. Sigh.. there is nothing I should have done to this hopper that should have broken it so.

Now, a year or two later, I can say the following. ""don't ever depend on this thing"" when you need a cup of coffee. There are so many times where I clean it, it works for a day, and then bam, it spits out an eighth of a tsp of liquid. It's just so unpredictable, I think it's time to get rid of it. I don't think I've gotten rid of something that cost so much because it's so untrustworthy.

....Update one year later, it's the only thing in my life that I've spent > $500 for and unceremoniously thrown away. Sure, I'm glad to have the counter space, but with zero pressure I'm not going to be Breville's QA department figuring out what's wrong with it. Don't buy this, you'll likely be sorry."
2070,5.0,2016-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I fought buying one of these for so long. Now I'm sorry. This is great. Burr grinder works flawlessly. Nice, decent capacity water storage tank. Makes the most perfect coffee every time...and fast. We don't ever use the drip machine anymore.

Well built. Seems like they want it to last a long time. Of all the choices out there, I would buy this item again.

Exceptionally well packaged. Delivery chosen was the free standard. It took a bit, but it was around Christmas."
2071,5.0,2020-09-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,It took about 10 pours to get the right combination of settings to make the perfect espresso for my taste. This model is for users who like high quality espresso and the flexibility to utilize the semi-automatic customization for adjusting the perfect espresso to their own tastes. Very price competitive to fully automatic machines.
2072,5.0,2020-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had no problems with this machine it’s everything it says it is, I love making cappuccinos with this machine and I 100% recommend"
2073,5.0,2021-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Highly recommend this espresso machine. It’s perfect size, not too big or small. Love everything about it. We decided to purchase this so we wouldn’t have to spend money at Starbucks or Dutch. Have already saved money on switching for the amount of coffee drinks we’ve made. Good investment."
2074,5.0,2020-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Product as described. Makes great coffee. fast shipping
2075,5.0,2021-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far it works well and make good espressos. The steam wand is a little hard to clean as the milk sticks to the outside.
2076,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easily programmed. Consistent Brewing. I use it daily.
2077,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"already made a couple hundred beverages. Cappuccinos, Lattes, Americanos, Mochaccinos. Made them all and they are way better than that coffee joint, what's their name...? you know, that one from Seattle."
2078,5.0,2020-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Santa brought me this for Christmas. Nice person that Santa guy. Now that I’ve practiced a bit with the machine, I’m making my favorite coffee drinks and love using it."
2079,1.0,2020-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very disappointed. After researching for several days I chose the Breville Barista Express. After following all instructions and watching youtube videos on how to make the perfect espresso I set out to perfect my latte. My first hurdle was getting the pressure to rise enough to getting into the grey extraction area. I ending up spending a bit of time going through some diagnostic testing and several trials to get that right. However, never did get the proper amount of extraction time. no surprisingly there are lots people online that have had the same problem with this machine.

A few days later I started having problem with he steam. It does one of two things, it either doesn't work at all or it purges and then starts to steam and then when you turn the dial to standby (so you can placing your cup of milk under it) and back to steam it purges again - right into you milk and then steams. I wasted several cups milk with this. I don't need perfection but I do expect a machine that costs $500-600 to work!
I'm not even going to mess around with it anymore. It cost as much as a washer or dryer I should not have problems with an appliance that cost this much money.
I will resume my search for a decent espresso machine."
2080,5.0,2020-10-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is nothing bad to say about that machine !!! !!!Amazing !!!
So good that this was my second one ! I got one for my office and 1 for my house!"
2081,5.0,2019-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it. Can’t go back to the original drip coffee maker. But be aware you will need to invest time to learn ins and outs of the machine.
2082,5.0,2020-04-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We splurged on this after our little De'Longhi espresso machine gave out after 8 years of use. We are all very happy so far after several months. Grinds well, extracts well, foams well. We have a much more expensive one at work that foams a bit faster but for the home kitchen this works well. I prefer my drinks to Starbucks now!"
2083,5.0,2020-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this after ditching my delonghi for poor espresso that was watery. I'm so happy I splurged a bit for this. My family is very big on espresso drinks and they loved this. Tastes perfect and gives perfect crema each time. Easy to clean and super easy to use. Plus the fresh grinder that goes right into the basket is great too.
2084,5.0,2021-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very good coffee machine I will buy again
2085,5.0,2016-07-24, Black Sesame,Love this espresso machine! Really easy to use and brews great coffee. Great buy for beginners
2086,3.0,2020-07-01, Black Sesame,I found the grinder was not consistent with the amount of coffee dispensed. This machine is not for the amateur.
2087,5.0,2021-04-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use and clean. Everything I expected for the price. Takes a little time to start from a cold state, but makes a great cup of coffee."
2088,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very user friendly
2089,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"While I love this Breville espresso maker ( I now have two, I previously purchased one for another house in silver), I was disappointed with the black one. Not only was it more expensive but I don’t think the picture fairly represents what the item actually looks like. I was expecting this to be a flat black matte finish- but it’s VERY shiny! Also un- like the silver one that I have at home the black one has a shiny silver back to it. I was looking for something that would blend in a little bit more for a camp and this, unfortunately, sticks out in the kitchen like a sore thumb. My advice would be to save the $70 and stick with the silver one!"
2090,4.0,2020-07-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,After some practice it’s working
2091,1.0,2021-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Broke right after warranty was up. Looks like this is a common thing after researching the internet.
2092,5.0,2021-02-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! You really have to read the instruction book before doing anything!! It's no way a plug in and go!! I was pretty confused at first but I printed off a review that a guy wrote that was three pages long! He gave great suggestions as well as do's and dont's!!
2093,5.0,2018-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best espresso machine I have had. I previously had a delonghi super automatic which was fine but this machine makes a way better espresso. Fantastic crema everytime.
2094,5.0,2016-05-23, Black Sesame,I love this machine so much. Making iced and hot drinks. Just watch a video on how to fine tune everything.
2095,5.0,2019-03-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love love love my espresso machine. I managed a high end coffee shop and now love this machine for my home use. It steams beautifully, pulls nice shots!!!"
2096,5.0,2021-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a good product, I am still learning"
2097,5.0,2020-12-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Unit works great.
2098,5.0,2019-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I haven’t bought starbucks or even had regular coffee since this machine. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Please watch YouTube videos to get the best experience!!
2099,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent product!
2100,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is exactly as advertised. It works like a professional model for the home. It is well designed, and makes consistently high quality coffee every time. Very impressed. Wish I had made the decision to get one sooner. I use it several times daily."
2101,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Best coffee
2102,3.0,2022-02-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,It took some time to understand how to operate this espresso machine and I'm an engineer! Now just four years later the machine isn't performing. You'd expect an espresso machine that just makes one or two cappuccinos several times a week to last longer than four years. I am trying to find out if it can be repaired. At the price of this machine you'd think it would last longer than four years. I'm in contact with manufacturer and will give an update when I hear back them.
2103,3.0,2021-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Looks pretty. Great coffee, when it works. I have lots of trouble getting the espresso pressure to be centered in the meter. The coffee grounds filter often gets stuck on the machine, but comes off with little effort. Also, it wastes a lot of water in its ""purge"" cycle, which happens each time you use the steamer. Makes a bit of a mess, and needs a lot of cleaning. Lasted 3 months so far, with almost daily use. All in all, I don't regret buying it."
2104,5.0,2018-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. Once you get it dialed in it delivers perfect shots. It's easy to use, even my husband can make himself a great mocha so it saves us money."
2105,5.0,2021-07-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I researched and researched prior to deciding upon the Breville Espresso. Several days of experimenting and I am now making delicious coffees. After reading negative reviews on this item, I would like to say that it is extremely important to read the instruction manual and to watch several youtube videos. The more you know and understand the machine the better your coffee will be. Hopefully I will never need customer service so I can not comment on their service department at this time."
2106,3.0,2020-05-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,The water only gets up to 140 degrees. I preheat it for 15 minutes. Did it make any difference. Water temperature needs to be 195 degrees at least to pull a decent shot of espresso. Breville needs to fix that issue
2107,5.0,2018-06-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes great espresso and has been very reliable. Just pay attention to when the cleaning light comes on and keep up on maintenance. Had mine for over a year and it is still going strong!!
2108,5.0,2021-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,It is absolutely amazing. Makes the best coffee. No longer want or need to drink coffee anywhere else. So easy to clean and maintain. Worth every penny
2109,1.0,2019-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this machine 18 months, it's in a 2nd home I spend about 1/3 of my time in, mostly alone, so not used daily or heavily. I've taken care of it as directed, cleaned it, descaled it, etc. Watched multiple youtubes on how to fix, how to use, and called customer service for help. I've had all sorts of espresso machines over the years.

Nothing about it is working right. Grind amount doesnt work (only grinds a small amount , dial does nothing to adjust), and coffee won't dispense properly.

Foolishly I didn't get an extra warranty with it so I have no recourse.

I NEVER could master the foaming process so used a separate foamer. I did have a friend once learn how to do it. Has a learning curve just for that.

I know many seem to really like this machine, maybe they have better technical skills or got a better version? Just beware if you're not the handy sort and want an easy machine to use this may not be for you."
2110,1.0,2021-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Lightly used for less than 2 years and it stopped working. No children or heavy handling it. I suspect we got something faulty because it’s weird for a machine over $600 to just stop working like that despite gentle use. Triplenet was the seller and offered no assistance.
2111,5.0,2020-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. I had gone thru 3 before this, they were all not powerful enough to make strong double shot. The grinder is great, the strength of the shots, and the size is perfect. I can't recommend this machine enough. The gauge helps u see if ur getting a good shot or not which I like alot."
2112,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Like most of you, I was debating about espresso machines and glad I went with this one. It's more expensive up from but in the long run, cheaper than capsule espresso makers"
2113,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"make nice espresso, easy to use."
2114,5.0,2016-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far we are very happy! Make a real Italian expresso as well my wife is very pleased with the Cappuccino’s I made for her!
2115,5.0,2022-08-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent product!!
2116,5.0,2020-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,It takes couple days to fine tune it after that works like an angel definitely a must have for coffee lovers
2117,5.0,2017-04-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Totally worth the price! My wife and I use it every day. Quality built product that produces tasty espresso! I’d recommend this product to anyone.
2118,5.0,2020-09-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought it for my sons birthday and he loves it.
2119,5.0,2021-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,It's very good 👍
2120,5.0,2018-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best coffee ever - once you get the pressing down. YouTube has lots of tips for the best practice.
I have not cleaned it yet. Looks simple."
2121,5.0,2021-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes excellent espresso, lattes, coffee."
2122,5.0,2014-06-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso machine for home use. 100% excellent choice of coffee machine!!
2123,5.0,2015-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Got this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he was thrilled! Works way better than our previous starter espresso machine, although we loved that machine too."
2124,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Delicious espresso at home. My pod based nespresso machine died and I decided to go for the real deal espresso machine as a replacement. I'm sure glad I did. Strong velvety espresso shots are easy to pull. Much higher quality than nespresso pods. Get this machine
2125,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have Starbucks home made every morning! I absolutely love this machine! I had the three thousand dollar one built in a few years back, since sold that house and purchased this, it’s better!"
2126,5.0,2015-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the best coffee machine! So easy to use and I am so happy that I can make my favorite lavender/ honey oat milk lattes at home!
2127,5.0,2019-05-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very easy to use
2128,3.0,2021-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"To start, the filter baskets keep sticking to the coffee maker instead of the filter holder, second, no matter how you set up the grind amount dial, the same amount of coffee is ground and third, even though a tiny amount of liquid drips, the drip tray has to be emptied on a regular basis, it seems that the same amount of coffee gets in the drip tray that actually goes in the cups"
2129,5.0,2019-09-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it so much....make my coffee on my way...
2130,5.0,2020-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This will change your life.

MY ONLY ADVICE

Get a Knock box. It will literally change our life. Its such a mess cleaning out the coffee maker without it.

I also really like Lavazza Beans, the Crema one definitely is true to its name and its not very expensive. Plus they go on sale occasionally."
2131,5.0,2020-07-08, Black Sesame,"This is my first espresso machine and I hope it last long with me b'coz I really love what it does and not to say, it cost almost my one paycheck.
I'm still a beginner and learning latte arts, but it really makes good foam and great shots - I needed to dial the grinder alot of times to pull the almost perfect shot. What I really like is that I get compliments whenever they try and taste my coffee. They loved it and so do I."
2132,5.0,2019-12-31, Black Sesame,It is awesome to be able to make my own lattes. I can make stronger lattes that what’s available in most cafes. This machine has saved me hundreds of dollars so far.
2133,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! This is the 3rd one I’ve purchased
2134,4.0,2021-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,More like 4.5 stars. This is a great machine. I love that it has everything in one. It took me about 2 weeks to adjust the settings just right for what they call an optimum press. The one thing I wish - that the holder for the portafilter under the grinder was lower. Grinds tend to spill over and create a mess. The milk and coffee come out extremely hot. I like that. Overall it's just about perfect so far.
2135,2.0,2020-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The main issue with this machine is the poor quality of grinder (literally everything else is great).

I've owned 3 or these before. I purchased my first one 2 yrs ago. I loved it, it was superb and had no issues. I purchased another one about 10mths ago and I assumed I'd received a fualty one because the grinder couldn't handle the lightest load of grinding fresh beans and just continued to malfunction and break down. Sometime after I sent that 2nd machine back I ordered another one. Now after a week of very light use the grinder is failing to function properly as well. I now have to assume that the first one I purchased 2yrs ago was a great machine, but not the norm, and the two I've owned since are what is to be expected. I'm very disappointed."
2136,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Holy smokes! I’m so lucky I bought this before the whole Coronavirus. Killer machine. Great coffee. Why didn’t I buy this years ago.
2137,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I don’t even go to coffee shops anymore because I can choose my beans and prepare my latte just the way I like it!
2138,5.0,2020-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my espresso machine!!! Although I still have some figuring out to do as to how fine and what number I have to set grinding for Starbucks espresso beans.

Otherwise it’s a dream machine. ♥️"
2139,5.0,2021-07-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What do I like? Everything! Hubby got this for me (a former starbuck-a-holic). Breville makes a most excellent latte... like suckling straight from the latte teet.. hahahaha ERR ma Gerrrr amazing flavor with the starbucks espresso beans.. This has paid for itself, with the money saved from not going out."
2140,4.0,2021-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A nice design with a professional barista look. However, depending on the coffee beans, it takes time to dial into the exact expresso shot with consistency. In time, I will update this review....Only had it for a day so stay tune!"
2141,5.0,2021-04-21, Black Sesame,"Excellent machine, BUT quite difficult to setup. Takes time (1 week) to get a good espresso. There are lot's of issues to make a creamy good espresso: grinding, amount and type of coffee, temperature, pressure, etc. The setup is more difficult than I would like. But after a successful tentative and error setup, the coffee it produces is really good. Highly recommended, but take time to setup."
2142,5.0,2021-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Used with Lavazza Super Crema beans, available here.  Lavazza Super Crema Espresso - Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag (Packaging May Vary)  After about two mornings of fiddling with grind size, amount, tamping pressure, and extraction...we'll never buy coffee from a shop again. About the only negative thing I can say is that the steam tank occasionally runs out of juice before you're done frothing. Then you just have to wait a minute for pressure to build and you're back in business."
2143,5.0,2020-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very easy to use and clean .
2144,1.0,2015-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Warranty expired 12 days ago... now machine is broken. For $700 +tax you would think it would last a bit long after the warranty expires.
2145,5.0,2020-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Other than me not being very good at putting things together, I find this product excellent. It's easy to use and makes great krema. I love it and highly recommend it."
2146,1.0,2021-05-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm very bummed to have to give a single-star review for a product. Let me preface by saying I love Breville -- their products are a great blend of form and function. I have a fair amount of other Breville products too: a toaster oven, a microwave, and an electric kettle.

This machine was great. I'm not sure if I received a defective unit that just never acted up until now or what. In any case, the machine no longer does what it's supposed to and I'm about half a year outside the warranty. I'm a heavy coffee drinker, so this is a pretty big bummer for me. I don't want to spend money on a repair or go without some kind of coffee maker for weeks/months while I wait.

You can search on YouTube for ""Breville buzzing sound"" and you'll see plenty of videos that have the buzzing issue to one degree or another. My machine has it so severely that it buzzes throughout the entire double-shot process and fails to even push any water through or build pressure. No amount of cleaning cycles or decalcification cycles have made any difference.

No way I would have ever dropped $600 on an espresso machine with a 1.5 year lifespan if I had known -- *sigh* -- time to start saving for another (non-Breville) machine."
2147,5.0,2020-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Would definitely recommend.
2148,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"While at first I was hesitant to invest in such an expensive machine, I've come to realize that this machine will quickly pay for itself. I'm making coffee for so cheap and it is far more delicious than nespresso or my local coffee shop!"
2149,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really like how this Espresso Machine is very easy to use and clean up is a breeze. I've had this for 4 months and have no issues whatsoever. After continual use, I'm able to make my coffee faster than making a pot of coffee on regular machines."
2150,5.0,2021-04-01, Black Sesame,"Love it, love it, love it. No need to stop at the coffee shop no more!"
2151,5.0,2019-11-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great Product
2152,5.0,2020-05-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee machine!
2153,5.0,2021-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Thus product has brought delight to the family. Learning how to make lattes, macchiatos , etc. This machine is very sturdy, the material isn’t the cheap feeling . Best purchase! Took me a little while to find the perfect setting for the espresso grind . One you find it you’ll have no problems!"
2154,5.0,2021-05-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We had the 860 for many years and used it every single day. After the pump died, I replaced it then the grinder started to go out. Decided it was time for a new machine. The last one was so great we just got the newer model. Works great!"
2155,5.0,2014-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect
2156,5.0,2021-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,My daughter loves her gift!
2157,5.0,2019-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Expensive but exactly what i needed. I previously bought a cheaper espresso maker and that was a bad idea. This espresso maker is so much better.
2158,4.0,2018-02-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Machine is very loud.
2159,1.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,It arrived in a very large box and it was broken and with a lot of use
2160,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have had this machine for 4 years in June. It had performed well and we have treated it well. Now the machine will no longer produce sufficient pressure and the gauge had stopped working. Likely too expensive to repair and I cannot locate any Breville factory service (even for a charge) after the 1 year warranty. My advice: Buy the longest extended warranty available.
2161,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Kicked my ass until I figured everything out. Making good espresso is definitely an acquired skill. Lots of good YouTube videos though.
2162,5.0,2017-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Many reviews have been written but this is a terrific machine. Very easy to operate. And you can adjust the machine so easily to your own style that it is a top class espresso machine for your home. It fits easily on a counter without be obtrusive and still has the style everyone wants.
The unit comes with an assortment of extras that really come in handy. I use this mostly for espresso and lattes. The frothing is superb. Easy and consistent."
2163,5.0,2020-08-08, Black Sesame,It's easy to use if you read the instructions.
2164,5.0,2019-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works great! Easy to set up and use.
2165,1.0,2021-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE: The grinder on this coffee maker has been nothing but trouble. It has broken several times. Breville support has only been okay. It takes around 1.5 to 2 hours to get in contact with them, the first time I had service done they accidentally mistyped my address and delayed the process 2 weeks, and while I'm waiting on them to fix it I'm stuck without an espresso maker. The last time I had service done I clearly explained the problem and I even made a recording to show them what the issue was, and despite all that, once they shipped the espresso maker back to me, it was still broken, as if they did nothing to fix. It failed the first time.

I've been really disappointed with how the machine is holding up after just 6 months of ownership.

PREVIOUS: I have had this for 2 months now and it’s great! Honestly the coffee I get out is better than starbucks. I have had no issues and cleaning it is surprisingly easy."
2166,4.0,2021-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,You have to finesse the machine
2167,5.0,2019-11-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been using this for about 3 mos now and I LOVE it. I'm a beginner cappacino maker and after some experimentation, I now make my own delicious cappacino without having to leave my house! It did take a liittle time to figure out what settings worked best for me, but within a dozen times I figured out how to get it exactly right. And it also looks great on my kitchen counter . UPDATE 1/17/2018, just wanted to update from last review. Still love it!"
2168,5.0,2020-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee..... just like Starbucks!!
2169,5.0,2019-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love when a daring plan comes together! Since I am a real novice I spent a lot of time researching and finally decided this product had to be the one. Man, was I right. All the instruction videos helped make me familiar with the Barista Express right out of the box and before I knew it, we were brewing. Just that simple. So now that I no longer ""fear"" the damn thing, its time to start experimenting and I expect that will be a fun journey in the days ahead. I'm very happy I decided to purchase!"
2170,5.0,2014-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works great as seen on YouTube
2171,5.0,2020-03-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this espresso maker machine. I have been using this every day as part of my daily routine. Easy to install,clean and quick and make tasty espresso."
2172,2.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,I used to own a coffee stand did not want to pay for coffee again so purchased this hoping it would be good shots don't get hot and the grind is a mess no pressure. watched some you tube videos got the grind down and the shots down worked great for a while now back to the same thing ugggh i would not buy again or give as a gift good luck
2173,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If it works well for you then you are in luck. But you’d best hope it never has an issue that requires sending it in to Breville for service. Ours didn’t last 1 year before features weren’t working properly. Had I know it was going to be such a hassle to deal with their AWFUL customer service I would’ve just kept it and used a machine that didn’t work properly. Would have saved me time, money and a headache. I sent it in with the understanding it would take approximately 3 business days to fix. After 7 without any information I called on a Friday and was told it’d be shipped back the following Monday and that I should look for a tracking number. Monday came and went without a word. Now it’s Tuesday, the next person I got on the phone has told me it’s not even fixed, and for the second time today I’ve been transferred/put on hold for over 1+ hours. Safe to say I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER BREVILLE PRODUCT."
2174,5.0,2020-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As a complete newbie, I simply unboxed the Barista Express, actually read the well done documentation, and made my first espresso. While my first was not perfect, within 3 simple adjustments per the books guidance, I now make perfect lattes. We use Twinbrook Creamery 2% milk and it nearly stands alone in the cup it is so creamy."
2175,5.0,2018-11-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"5 years after purchase and daily use, love this espresso machine!"
2176,1.0,2016-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Initially I loved this machine. It made great foam, the espresso tasted fantastic, and it was easy to clean. However, shortly before the one year warranty expired, the water pump quit working. Breville arranged a repair and sent it back to me quickly--still in it's broken state. They repaired it again and sent it back--still broken. The 3rd time, they sent me a new machine. All was well for another 9 months. Then the 2nd machine quit. This time the espresso won't extract and no amount of trouble shooting will fix it. A call to Breville informed me it would cost $167 to repair it. At this point, I'm looking for a new machine from a different company. I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I truly expect more from such an expensive item. Look elsewhere--Breville has great advertising but I don't think their machines are good quality. (Just for reference, I extract 3-4 cups a day and cleaned the machine faithfully.)"
2177,5.0,2021-12-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome espresso machine! Does exactly what it is suppose to do. Would buy again. Saving me tons of money by not going to the coffee shops.
2178,5.0,2021-06-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine! And the Breville customer support was super helpful with trouble shooting and helping me to set it up:)
2179,2.0,2019-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this machine for Christmas of 2016. We liked the way it brewed coffee/espresso. Because of the cost I took very good care of it. Also because of the cost I bought the extend warranty. Good thing, because after 16 months it stopped building correct infusion pressure. We had to ship it from California to New York to have it checked/repaired. Parts are on order. It has been over 2 weeks now. You would think if you paid ~ $500 for an appliance it would work without issue for a lot more than 16 months. I was going to try other Breville products, but now I’m having second thoughts…
My machine has been at the repair facility for over 30 days now. The extend warranty contractor's (Asurion) web site is always buggy. This makes it quite hard to get status updates. I will update this review after I get my machine back."
2180,5.0,2019-07-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I get fresh roasted coffee beans from my son which caused me to buy an espresso machine. What a great 'all in one' machine. Works great. Very flexible for grind, extraction time, one or two shot, compression. Besides, it is great fun, truly enjoy the experience."
2181,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this coffee machine!! Best purchase ever!
2182,5.0,2017-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We are so happy with our purchase, this machine has exceeded expectations! We are no baristas but we do like to enjoy a good quality espresso. Having the grinder, tamper all in one is so conviniente. The product arrived even a day before schedule. Also, we had to turn to the instructions, and they were very informative!"
2183,5.0,2015-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easily fits under the counter.
2184,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was the last Father's Day present I got for my dad before he passed this year. I'm so happy with how straight forward everything works. Very well made. I'm happy he got to enjoy it so much, and I will get to remember him every time I make espresso. His greates compliments were how well made it was and his espresso was always perfect."
2185,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent product! Takes time to clean and needs to be well-cares for, but if you’re willing to learn the machine properly, it makes a fantastic drink!!"
2186,5.0,2020-03-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Might just be in the honeymoon phase, but I just love this machine... I’m by no means an expert barista, but I just love playing with this toy. Tastes amazing every time... and there’s a lot of available videos online to help narrow down the best ways to operate this."
2187,5.0,2021-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"La mejor máquina expresó en su precio. Buen sabor y aroma, también depende de el grano brinda buena espuma( foaming) el vaporizador para la leche no está nada mal crea buena crema."
2188,5.0,2019-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Really happy with it so far. Had it for a month. I've had some rainy weather and need to adjust the grind and a couple of clicks and only one shot waste and it's perfect. The tray takes the overspill of water and grinds and needs to be rinced out almost every day but it's easy. Pull the whole thing out and quickly rinse with water.
2189,5.0,2021-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,I had two super automatic espresso machines and they don't last long for the money. I also didn't like they way the machines textured the milk. After much research I settled on this machine and never looked back. I makes the best expresso for the price!
2190,5.0,2022-06-05, Black Sesame,I have loved this since I got it about 3 weeks ago. I have used it daily and have not had one problem. It is easy to use and operate. The lattes are amazing and my husband loves americanos. I make my kids hot chocolate with steamed milk or steamers and they love it too. It was been great to serve lattes and drinks to family and friends when they are over as well. I have not one bad thing to say so far!
2191,5.0,2020-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the real thing. Not overly complicated. Although it has a few settings that look daunting, the initial positions for all the dials noted in the manual work just fine. Takes about 2 minutes to make an iced latte from initial grind to final cleanup."
2192,5.0,2016-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I got this as a present for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. It looks really nice in the kitchen too.
2193,5.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,LOVE IT!
2194,5.0,2019-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had the BES870XL for a little over a week now and have almost gone through a 1 kilo bag of Lavazzo super crema while testing it. Overall, it's a great machine. Had it dialed in in no time and have been making great single and double shots, lattes, and ice coffees. Great functionality and ease of use. Can't recommend it highly enough. If you love coffee, it's a sane alternative to spending $5 for a latte at your local coffee shop."
2195,5.0,2019-09-25, Black Sesame,This is an amazing home espresso machine. It makes a beautiful espresso! It’s stout and sturdy and beautiful. Oh god I just spent almost $600 on a coffee machine!! It is a ritual for me every morning so this is worth it.
2196,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Got this for the husbands b-day and I’ve never seen him buy so much coffee beans just to keep trying it out! The only downfall??? The fact that he can’t stand normal coffee at work anymore lol which is bad for him but that goes to show how good this thing makes coffee!!!
2197,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Recieved my espresso machine on time from amazon. I have only had it for one day but its working perfectly so far. THIS IS AN AWESOME MACHINE. Looks super clean. Heats up fast. Makes espresso making simple fast and clean ups a breeze. Lots of crema in every shot so far. Will amend post in a few months to let you know if Ive had any issues. Great all in one machine.
2198,3.0,2019-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought mine in 2014, since then I have had to return it to be fixed (actuator on the grinder stopped working) and that was 200 dollars after owning for 3 years. Now, at 5 years, it will have to go in again for service, making it another 200 dollars. Otherwise, I like the machine but I shouldn't have to send the machine back twice in 5 years for an added 400 dollars."
2199,5.0,2020-10-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine! I works very well would like a little more steam power but that’s just nit picking! This machine is worth every cent.
2200,4.0,2020-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"i use this machine to make my art latte every day
love it no long go coffee shop"
2201,5.0,2021-05-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love our machine. We’ve had it for 4 years now and still going strong. We had to watch YouTube videos to learn how to properly use it but once we figured it out we became little baristas. Everyone looooves my iced caramel lattes!!
2202,5.0,2018-11-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"God bless America. Do not buy another espresso machine. This is the one. Not a single flaw. Promise. Clear off a good space on the counter Marge. RECOMMENDATION: Go ahead and get yourself a huge bag of Lavazza espresso beans too. Crema e aroma, or l'espresso gran crema. Grind amount 2 o clock, grind size 5. Go with god."
2203,5.0,2015-11-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a great espresso/ cappuccino
2204,5.0,2021-06-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great coffee machine. It is pricey, worth every penny. It makes super creamy Espresso. It will actually save a lot of money to in long run. Espresso is made within 5 mins from turn the machine on to ready to serve. Super easy to operate and clean."
2205,5.0,2020-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I had a older Breville espresso machine for 15 years and decided to upgrade. WOW this machine is so much faster and easier to use. It is like having coffee made from a professional machine every time. Makes the best lattes. Mark
2206,5.0,2017-10-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,No complaints. Looks good and makes a great cup. Love the hopper/grinder and steam wand. Feels sturdy and hopeful it will last for years.
2207,1.0,2014-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For a >$500 product, it should not stop working after 4 years. I bought this at the end of 2017 and it has just stopped working, the grinder will not start. Warning to future buyers: the Breville warranty is ONLY ONE YEAR. So if you also encounter this poor situation, you now have a giant hunk of dead $500 sitting on your kitchen counter."
2208,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,espresso machine kicks ass
2209,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Unless you want to spend over $2000.00. This is the best espresso machine I’ve seen or used. The steam want is pretty nice for the price of the machine. The espresso it creates is really good. So if you want excellent for under $2000.00. Get excited about this machine.
2210,3.0,2019-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love everything about this machine--it brews fantastically (I use Lavazza espresso) BUT the grinder part, I absolutely HATE. I wish I would have ordered the one without the grinder on it. It is extremely temperamental, hard to ""edit"" if you will--because the grounds need to be a certain consistency to get the perfect espresso and I still haven't figured it out. I just buy pre-ground espresso now. Screw that damn grinder."
2211,3.0,2018-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Started out as a great product but the coffee grinder failed after 6 months. Followed all the care and troubleshooting directions and have been trying for days to reach their customer service. So disappointed as I chose the brand for their strong reputation. Their website is not helpful and waited over an hour for a call back from their 800#. Then the call answers that they've got technical difficulties and it hangs up. Terrible service.
2212,5.0,2019-10-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have made an espresso on this machine every day since we got this at Christmas. It’s very simple to use. Definitely give it 5 stars.
2213,1.0,2020-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you enjoy working and cleaning your machine every few times you use it, get this POS. If you want hassle free espresso, DO NOT buy this machine. It’s been a headache ever since it was delivered. Simply not worth the headache of it not working correctly after trying n trying."
2214,3.0,2018-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had high hopes for this machine but some of my expectations were not realized.
for one, its really messy, the brewing handle is too shallow and the grind from the grinder spills over. many espresso machines are designed with deeper brewing cup so the pre-temp grind will not spill out but this one is very shallow and so some grind is being spilled all over so i always need to use my hand to wipe the cup edges.
the espresso itself is not consistent even between shots and i can not figure why, some comes out nice and slow and the next will gush out resulting in watery brew, could be that the grinder itself is not consistent or another reason."
2215,5.0,2020-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine, it is pricey but worth every cent and saves me money in the long run for my double shot latte with soy from Starbucks."
2216,5.0,2020-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best coffee maker ever
2217,5.0,2018-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing coffee machine. I use it everyday and it has worked flawlessly for couple hundreds of cups at least. I bought an extended warranty for 3 years from Canopy just because of the other reviews, but no problems yet! I had bought a Nespresso machine, but returned it after using about 60 pods of coffee and realizing how expensive it is vs buying coffee and grinding your coffee/making your own Nespresso. This thing is way cheaper and much better"
2218,5.0,2020-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I just got this today and although I've only had one cup from it, I'm in love! Love the milk frother, the setup, and the easy accessories to make a perfect cup. I haven't tried the grinder yet. This is my third espresso machine in 6 years... the other two lasted 3 years each"
2219,2.0,2018-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I so wanted to like this machine. We spent for us a large sum of money, $600 for this machine. When it works it produces wonderful espresso but that is not a majority of the time. We are just two years into ownership and we are on our 3 rd machine plus one repair of one of the 3 or 4 machines. That's a new machine every 6 months. The warranty was originally 5 years I believe, they have now changed that to 6 months for any refurbished machine they send out.

To their credit Breville has good customer service but if our machine/s are any indication they get plenty of experience.

We have had the new machine less than a week and already the pressure gauge does not measure correctly. An email to support has not generated any response.

We are not in a position to replace this machine but if we were I'd do so in a heartbeat."
2220,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This obviously has a learning curve if you’ve never pulled a shot of espresso before, but it’s seriously so easy to use!"
2221,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This unit can make excellent coffee. It can be a little finicky as to the beans used, grind and pressure used to compact the beans. But overall it's a good/best value."
2222,3.0,2022-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really loved this machine for the first year. However, the grinder stopped working after about 15 months. It will still grind, but it grinds incredibly fine regardless of which setting I use, rendering coffee that is unusable. I finally had to resort to using a separate grinder for my beans and just using the Breville to make the espresso and steam milk. Really sad that I spent so much money on something that didn't stand up to normal, every day use."
2223,5.0,2020-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, great espresso!"
2224,5.0,2019-09-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,The Breville Barista Express is amazing. It is fast & easy to use. No complaints at all. Love it. BEST CHOICE.
2225,4.0,2019-07-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great tasting espresso.
2226,5.0,2016-04-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I give 5 stars for this espresso machine, purchased in May 2018, I use it every day and love it. Easy to use, easy to maintain, it is just perfect.

Update:
4 years later (today is 09/12/2022) still works great, I use this espresso machine every day.
Highly recommended !"
2227,5.0,2021-11-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this as a gift for my husband who is an avid coffee drinker. It's very easy to use and the coffee comes out better for us than what we buy at coffee shops! We use it every day - definitely a good purchase!!
2228,5.0,2017-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This expresso machine is great and very easy to used for the coffee lovers
2229,5.0,2018-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far ... so good.

I went through a full bag of $20 espresso beans just to dial in the right amount of grind/pressure. It will take you some time as well. Every coffee bean is different. Be prepared to spend a few wasted shots before you get your perfect shot. It is easy to set up and use. Won't take a lot of adjusting before you're enjoying a great latte on a Sunday mornin before waffles."
2230,2.0,2022-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Not for moms who need magical bean juice to function in the mornings. My hubs bought me this for Mother’s Day, and it would be AMAZING if it came with a barista. But for the money, it’s not worth the effort to stand and make custom coffee drinks with littles clinging to your ankles. I ended up going with a Keurig instead because it’s much simpler to operate and much easier to clean. This machine is super nice and bougie. But as a mom of 5, it takes too long to “babysit” while making coffees than I care to spend."
2231,5.0,2019-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had multiple Gaggia expresso machines over the past 10 years. A close friend made me an Americano with her Breville and it was wonderful.
So when my espresso machine was dying I shelled out the extra and purchased the Breville BES870XL. I LOVE it! The machine and accessories are all well made. The machine is easy to use and my first cup perfect. Definitely worth the money."
2232,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Recent purchase after my last one from a different brand fried. Didn’t know what I was missing. This espresso machine is worth every penny. Easy to use and set up, not complicated for any beginner. This machine blows other one out of the water."
2233,2.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"I hate when the negative reviews end up being correct. I really do.

I decided to splurge on an espresso maker for our new home and really enjoyed the espresso machine and learning the different ways to make espressos, lattes, and cappuccinos and then....well, then things started to go bad.

Let me say I was adamant about properly maintaining this machine. I cleaned, descaled and changed filters per the recommendations and sometimes even before the recommended time but apparently, that doesn't matter because the internal mechanics are not made to lasts. My machine no longer creates any pressure instead it makes a bunch of noise and bitter coffee drips from the cup that used to produce delicious espresso.

I've searched online, cleaned and prayed to the coffee goods but can't get it to work so save yourself $600 and go with a different brand."
2234,5.0,2021-02-14, Black Sesame,Excellent espresso coffee machine!
2235,1.0,2020-11-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This product was great while it lasted. It sprung a leak shortly after purchase with light use (once or twice a week). There is no pressure at all because of the leak and I tried to reach out to customer service multiple times but was unable to reach anyone because of covid all wait times were way over an hour. Their live chat option was always unavailable which means you only have the option of waiting on hold for hours. I waited until covid died down months later and was able to talk with someone about the issue. I am outside of the warranty and they charge a flat rate of $300 for any repairs. Long story short, great product, not great warranty or customer support."
2236,5.0,2020-02-20, Black Sesame,"Great machine. The only thing that I am a bit disappointed is the tamper seems a bit in a cheap side, very light."
2237,5.0,2017-03-06, Black Sesame,"It took me a few weeks to learn the proper frothing techniques, but, man, now the lattes and cappucinos I am making are some of the best I've had. This is all the machine anyone needs, really. It would be nice to have a double boiler, but it isn't worth the extra 700. If you dont mind taking a LITTLE bit of time to make your cup, then this machine is all you need."
2238,5.0,2020-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great coffee maker. Takes a little bit to get started/set up when you first get it, but once you figure it out, the espresso/coffee is great."
2239,5.0,2020-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worth the money
2240,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Second one i bought one for the house and the other for my office, love it"
2241,5.0,2018-07-25, Black Sesame,"The best espresso machine ever!
We've had this for a little of 3 months and it's been amazing how the coffee just keeps on getting better! The espresso it produces is at a professional grade and makes our neighborhood late's to shame!
We had a Delonghi machine before this one and it barely lasted one year before it went out and was no longer covered by the warranty..
Highly recommend spending a little extra and getting this machine as it is worth every penny."
2242,5.0,2021-05-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,very good machine
2243,5.0,2018-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had that for almost a year, works like a gem. Unfortunately I only have the time to make lattes on the weekend, but they are anywhere from as good to better what i get for $5 at a sbux/coffee shop nearby. Used different beans with different results, the lavazza crema may make the best looking espresso."
2244,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best all around expresso machine for the money. Amazing looks and design! The grinder works great, everything seems to be very well made. The froth wand works well, I feel like it could use a little more pressure but still does it's job. I've been using the non-pressurized basket and it delivers a great shot of expresso with the prefect amount of cream. Very happy with this purchase!"
2245,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love it
2246,5.0,2019-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent product!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2247,1.0,2020-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have bought this machine for a while but could not use it because Filter Size lights kept flashing. Finally, we figured it out that the hooper must be locked. I cannot even find this step in initial start up guide."
2248,5.0,2020-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Machine is great want Ice coffee or a small cup of expresso done. With in minutes enjoy a good cup of coffee to start the day.
2249,4.0,2020-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Noisy
2250,5.0,2021-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Really straight forward to put together. Makes a really good cup of coffee. Have been using the factory setting and haven’t messed with the pressure or grind size. Not a coffee snob but know enough to tell weather it’s good or not. I’d recommend it for sure
2251,2.0,2021-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"bought this product used it for a couple of days somewhat good quality although it stopped working right after plugging it to 220volts as this product does not contain killswitch which turns device off when accidentally plugged to 220volts, this literally almost burned my house, such poor design for an expensive product that doesn't contain a cheap killswitch. When contacted customer support as I had bought a 3 year warranty and just bought the device they completely ignored the issue at first then would not replace or help in fixing the issue after it stopped working."
2252,5.0,2019-12-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Has worked well and it is just as good if not better than any coffee house machine. Great quality and easy to use.
2253,5.0,2019-01-11, Black Sesame,Best espresso machine ever. Only downfall is I drink way to many macchiatos now that I have the power of Starbucks in my own hands!!
2254,5.0,2020-11-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love, love, love it. Amazing"
2255,3.0,2016-08-03, Black Sesame,"Machine lost pressure right after warranty. Researched several websites for the cause. Replaced pump, still didn't work. Then was told to replace solenoid assembly, and the problem I ran into is that no-one sells it. If I was to choose again what machine to buy, I would not buy something that no-one has parts for. Choose a different brand
To my surprise, Breville honored the warranty after 20 days of expiration, and agreed to repair."
2256,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this machine a little over a year ago along with the protection plan. It worked fine until it decided to spit coffee all over the place. I purchased a 3 year protection plan and guess what? There is no repair. They send you an Amazon gift card instead so I’m now stuck spending the amount on them anyway. So basically you’re buying a plan that makes you buy more stuff. Screw you amazon!!!
2257,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is my second Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine! Without a doubt it is the most used and appreciated machine in our home! Perfect espresso every single time!
2258,5.0,2020-06-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome expresso maker!
2259,4.0,2018-06-08, Black Sesame,Espresso machine is awesome . down falls are small water tank and milk steamer is a little slower than i wanted . Still a great product.
2260,5.0,2021-05-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Overall a solid machine. Was very frustrating until I picked up a scale to premeasure each batch and a palm tamper to have more consistency.
2261,5.0,2020-03-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I had a problem with the grinder and offered a replacement immediately after running some tests with me. I should received in few days d
2262,5.0,2017-08-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Life changing, high quality machine produces a latte or espresso approximately a gazillion times better than that available at your local Starbucks. Does it sound like you are in a coffee shop - why yes it does but it's totally worth the noise the clean up etc. Worth every dollar so far ..."
2263,5.0,2020-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Works amazing! I had to learn a bit about what goes into making a good espresso. Once I read through the manual a couple of times and experimented with it, it cranks out a great Americano or Latte every time!"
2264,5.0,2021-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very nice machine, been using it for over a year daily! The best coffee machine i got"
2265,5.0,2019-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Definitely the best expresso maker I have purchased. I have had 4 ranging from 200 to 1000 dollars. Best one out of all of those.
2266,5.0,2021-05-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I absolutely love this espresso machine. It definitely takes practice and reading the manual. I also found the reviews very helpful. I have no experience at all in making espressos. Shot glasses are not included. So make sure you buy your glasses, knock box and a tamping mat. It’s gorgeous on my counter. I love it!"
2267,5.0,2019-10-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,First one we ordered didnt work but was able to return it and get a new one. Works great! Easy to use.
2268,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing!
2269,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great
2270,5.0,2020-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,best machine I ever got .. we’ll worth the money ..super easy to use and clean and the best freshest coffee ever
2271,5.0,2020-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Got this for a present. Very easy to use and clean. Makes great cappuccino and lattes!! Definitely worth the money!!
2272,4.0,2020-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,We bought our machine about a week ago and are absolutely in love with it! Have been using it a few times on the daily.
2273,5.0,2020-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Once you have a latte or shot from this machine youll never go back to Starbucks. The beans you buy are just as important but if you looking at investing in a machine at this price point then you already know that. Best machine for the money. Ive had it for 4 months now and making mocha, latte, or shot with this machine is a garaunteed treat. Worth every penny. Hope it last a long time."
2274,5.0,2018-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A wonderful machine to fuel my coffee addiction. Easy to use with automatic modes, but every operation can be manually controlled too. This lets you experiment with your technique. I wish it were easier to change the beans between caffeinated and decaf, but I make do by only putting in enough beans for a single shot."
2275,5.0,2021-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine and I’m glad I invested in it
2276,5.0,2021-03-04, Black Sesame,"This was not an inexpensive purchase for me and I spent a lot of time looking around. Last espresso maker I purchased was $100 so this was a big jump! I could not be happier it took some playing with the settings but with a little practice I was able to get it consistent. Lavazza beans, grind 6, medium tamp = perfect espresso every time! BUY IT IF YOU CAN!"
2277,5.0,2018-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine! Love it!
2278,2.0,2017-04-19, Black Sesame,"I was excited to finally get this machine after eyeing it a few years ago. Unfortunately it didn’t work. Something was wrong with the pressure. Regardless of grind size, tamping pressure, etc. I could never get the single shot to pull for the right amount of time even though the pressure gauge said the pressure was in the ideal espresso zone. The double shot worked better. Not sure why there is a difference.

The other problem is with the steam wand. It takes forever to start generating steam, and when it finally does, it stops after only about 10 seconds. That’s not enough time to froth milk.

Fortunately Amazon has a great return policy,"
2279,5.0,2019-12-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love the color, the price and the ease of use"
2280,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine!! My first try at making my own cappuccinos went pretty smooth thanks to some of the detailed reviews on here. I’m still learning, but this machine makes it easier than I thought. The espresso is perfect and so smooth."
2281,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love it so far. It works great. The pressure control really makes a great difference in coffee's taste. I would never go back to drink coffee drops. And I haven't bought one Starbucks latte over last four month, which is about equal to the cost of this machine."
2282,1.0,2015-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve texted 6 days ago and still no answer! After 7 month of using we have a problem with this machine! Water leak under machine.
2283,5.0,2021-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Professional grade coffee at a great price. A bit of a learning curve, but if you use the double wall extractor cups, it is pretty easy to get a good cup of coffee, and will tide you over until you learn the more difficult single wall."
2284,5.0,2016-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use and very customizable for personal taste. I've been using for about a month now and am happy with the purchase.
2285,5.0,2018-11-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is my third Espresso machine and my best... Love it❤️
2286,1.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased Barista Express 8 months ago. It stopped working after about 7 months. I called Breville - they sent one part to replace, still did not work, then sent another part, did not work. Took 3 weeks. Finally they said to send the machine to them to fix. Called them after a week and customer service said they seem to have lost the machine when shipping back. I asked for refund or supervisor to call back - no one called. I called 4 days in a row - their reps are completely clueless, unhelpful. DO NOT PURCHASE this product - customer support non existent!"
2287,5.0,2019-11-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is an amazing Espresso maker. I have 2 of them the first of which is two years old now. I make 1-2 cups/day and machine is still going strong.
2288,5.0,2015-09-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. I am pure espresso drinker and this makes a wonderful cup of espresso. However, my mom and other members of my family like latte and the foamy milk is very good. The machine is not cheap, but definitely delivers."
2289,5.0,2016-09-11, Black Sesame,"We are coffee snobs, and we LOVE this machine!!!

The money you save not buying coffees on the road is worth it!!!"
2290,5.0,2015-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Ｉlike it。
2291,5.0,2020-06-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,This has been a game changer! No more expensive overpriced coffees out! It blends well and makes a fantastic latte - one shot or two. Early days but cleaning and care has been pretty easy.
2292,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wanted one for years finally bit the bullet and it is fantastic just love it
2293,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,After watching a couple of you-tube videos and reading the manual I was quickly able to master the process of making great cappuccino's and lattes. this machine is great for home use and is a beautiful piece of equipment as well.
2294,5.0,2020-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are used to using very nice machines elsewhere (costing > $2000), then you will be able to feel the difference in the sturdiness/heaviness of the parts. However, lighter construction can be expected because this machine costs less than $600, and is only making about 15 cups of coffee per week instead of hundreds per day.

Luckily, the quality of the coffee it makes is very good, and I also really like the integrated coffee grinder."
2295,5.0,2020-06-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is everything, goodbye Starbucks!! I am obsessed, easy to use & makes amazing espresso :)"
2296,5.0,2020-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I can't judge the reliability yet, as I've been using this machine only for 5 months. However, in terms of beverage quality, it produces an amazing espresso and delicious cappuccinos. It is clearly the best espresso machine I've ever used, and I've owned many of them.
Worth the price, hopefully it will last."
2297,3.0,2017-10-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Through numerous trials , I have not been able to reach espresso range on pressure gauge. All coffees taste good but not true espresso since I can only achieve pro- fusion pressures. Tried new beans, different compaction and fill amounts. NEED HELP! Return from Far East Thanksgiving / GSS"
2298,1.0,2020-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this one because our old coffee machine broke down. Then I found there was a good deal on Amazon and I bought it as soon as possible. I opened the box very happily but I found some scratches around the button. The products I bought should be a brand new one, why are there some scratches? I am concerned that if it is the one someone returned or something else. But if I return it , there will not be any discounts anymore. There is no way to contact the customer service, so I write the review."
2299,2.0,2019-09-27, Brushed Stainless Steel," Bought this product about a year ago and my wife and I LOVE making Lattes every morning. The coffee grinder grinds the perfect amount with the perfect size (once you experiment a little).
And the espresso is perfect. the steam wand is excellent and feels very professional.

All was great until it blew up on me. See video below. i had just made my wife hers when i went to remove the portafilter it completely exploded and shattered the cup i was pouring in to. thank goodness the glass went flying to the left and right or else i could have been seriously injured.

PS. we regularly clean and decalcify the product per instructions."
2300,5.0,2020-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my second Breville (I have 2 homes) I cant live without it, I figure if you add up the Lattes from a coffee shop it justifies this wondrful indulgence. takes some practice, look at youtube videos and only use good never frozen or refrigerated - fresh whole coffee beans or it just wont pull a good shot"
2301,5.0,2020-02-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a great product. We don’t buy coffee drinks anymore. It takes a bit to clean but it’s worth it
2302,5.0,2017-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just get this. It’s everything you need. No really, stop reading reviews and just get it."
2303,5.0,2020-04-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes an awesome espresso!
2304,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love how it looks, and can't beat a tasty morning latte!"
2305,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This product leaked water from the getgo. I finally contacted support and ended up sending the machine in for repair. Got it back and not it leaks worse than it did before. I am now trying to get them to email me back. I want a new machine but likely not going to get it sense its outside the window.
2306,5.0,2020-04-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very nice! The quality and build is superb, the espresso comes out amazing! The controls are awesome, I’ve adjusted for the water to drop little longer than usual, and it taste great! I love the packaging, the ease of set up and the options of grind, steam, water collection etc. Worth the price!"
2307,5.0,2020-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm so impressed. This not only makes an amazing espresso - it's so much fun to use. I'm a ""newbie"" and with a few days of playing around, it's easy to use. I also feel I've gotten consistently better at the craft of making great espresso shots as time has gone. The product has performed flawlessly the last month and we use it every morning. I'm just so impressed."
2308,4.0,2020-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this because we had a super automatic which when grinding the beans would sometimes overflow in to machine causing problems. This is a semiautomatic and the beans grind out so eliminates this problem, although it can be messy. Love the espresso and milk frother!!! YUM!!! Just like Starbucks!"
2309,4.0,2018-02-17, Black Sesame,"Only complaint is that stream for milk frothing always starts with water, not stream! Have to wait couple seconds before stream eventually comes out."
2310,5.0,2020-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works great.
2311,5.0,2014-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great product to use for people who have a hobby of making coffee. I think a background in coffee making helps as it takes a little practice. Great design, function and results. It took a little experimentation to get all the settings correct."
2312,5.0,2021-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes a PHENOMENAL espresso. I have been able to stop spending so much money at coffee shops and enjoy it at home. Pretty easy to set up and use, but it does take a bit to get the hang of making espresso to your taste."
2313,4.0,2018-07-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Machine is great. Only gripe is that Amazon literally dropped the price by fifty bucks mere hours after I purchased the machine ugh.
2314,5.0,2017-12-11, Black Sesame,"I have had this espresso machine for over a year, and having used a variety of machines, I can honestly say that this espresso machine will pull better shots than machines that cost significantly more. It is an elegant combination of modern technology and design, and it comes with everything you need to have a top-quality experience. If you want a practical machine that doesn't cut corners, here it is."
2315,3.0,2018-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Missing parts, so buy new not refurbished. Very difficult to use in my opinion. Cannot seem to dial in the grind correctly. Not sure what I’m doing wrong."
2316,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing espresso machine for a small office. We have a team of 22 people and this machine is used all day long. Very convenient to have the grinder built in. We chose to have the steamer separate and not have the milk built in so everyone can change their choice of milk.
2317,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine!!
2318,5.0,2019-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome espresso machine!
2319,5.0,2019-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes the best espresso I've ever had, but does take some tinkering to get the settings right.

The key is to compress the puck, probably about it can take.
If the coffee isn't as good as you'd like, try different beans. We started with regular Starbucks espresso bean, but they made horrible espresso. When we switched to Lavazza, it was night and day."
2320,5.0,2017-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,An impressive machine
2321,5.0,2019-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Man i love this thing. It gives you everything you need at a pretty good price. I looked online for weeks and decided to go with this and it was one of my best decisions. Super high quality
2322,5.0,2020-08-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works as described! We use this almost daily! Heats up very quickly and makes great steamed milk for Latte's. This unit is very easy to clean and easy to use! Great product at a great price! Nice job Breville!
2323,5.0,2020-05-03, Black Sesame,I love this thing. I use it several times per day. I’ve have no issues at all. Makes amazing espresso.
2324,5.0,2020-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Extremely good for the price, almost perfect coffee and works well, I’m using it for my coffee shop and it is amazing how good coffee make and all my customers love it!!! Thanks Breville!!"
2325,5.0,2021-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have bought a few lower cost/quality machines in the past. This machine is definitely not that! Although we haven't had it long, it has been easy to set up and use. Since receiving it, we have used it multiple times per day. We are giving up going to the local coffee shop every morning, and while we'll miss our baristas, we won't miss the money we're going to save!"
2326,5.0,2020-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent espresso machine. Easy to program, just press one button to get desired amount and a knob adjusts the grind amount a selector on the side adjusts the grind. Very durable construction and excellent quality. The result is a machine that is conparable to commercial machines. This was my Christmas gift to my Mom this year."
2327,5.0,2019-04-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Looks like a high quality espresso machine. After 5 yrs of super automatic machines, I actually enjoy making my own latte coffee and found the taste and desire I was looking for. Very happy with the purchase and price was less than I expected of this quality."
2328,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!! Working as a barista (of course) for over 5 years, I used to only think Cimbali was worth your time when it comes to espresso. This little machine, however, is the best thing to be added to our countertop. Good bye, coffee shops!"
2329,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As many others have suggested, it does take time to configure (finding the right grinder setting, right tamping technique, right volume of coffee ground, etc.) but once you get it down -- and it took us about two weeks -- this machine does indeed turn out the perfect espresso. Be patient, it's worth it.

Now that we know the machine can really bring it, the next criterion for us will be, for how long? For that, we'll just have to wait and see."
2330,5.0,2021-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nicely designed. Working perfectly. Make great espresso/coffee. Easy to operate. Highly recommend.
2331,5.0,2019-09-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It takes a while to really learn the skill of packing the portafilter properly, there's a learning curve. But once you get a feel for what works for you, this machine makes fantastic espresso."
2332,5.0,2018-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"i wish it was a little quieter, but i can't complain really, since steaming milk isn't a quiet process. i LOVE making my morning coffee with this machine!"
2333,3.0,2020-08-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Used it every day for 18 months, and now the reservoir has a leak. No way easily see a fix. Will have to call the company. The leak appears to be from an area where there is no way to replace a gasket. I hope I wont have to buy a whole new tank considering the cost. The machine itself is great! makes great coffee... just didn't expect to have to fix the thing in under two years."
2334,5.0,2019-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine helped me preparing my coffee at home with wonderful taste
2335,5.0,2020-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve only had my Breville for three days and there is a learning curve. I’ve found that when I have made less than a perfect cup of expresso I can still turn it in to a good cup of Americano! A lot of fun!
2336,2.0,2017-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,So I went through a whole bag of coffee trying g to get it to pull a shot correctly. Very frustrated in that the next bag of coffee was a different flavor and so I was back to square one. I thought since I worked in a coffee shop I could master this but I ended up frustrated. There was no way the rest of my family was going t on be able to get a cup of coffee if I couldn’t. It looked so easy online. I ended up returning it and getting a breville grind for drip coffee machine.
2337,5.0,2020-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I couldn't be happier with this machine. The grind is great, the adjustments you can make are wonderful, you can program the shots to the volume you need, it will grind unattended and shut off when done. The steamer seems to be a little bit weak, but does get the job done."
2338,5.0,2020-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Now that I have this espresso machine, I can't quite figure out how I survived without it. Makes every morning coffee that much better knowing I made it myself and tastes just as good if not better than coffee I would buy at a coffee shop."
2339,4.0,2020-07-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, perfect for home espresso. Takes some practice to get the right pressure to achieve good crema and consistent good results. I have no experience as a barista and found the instructions and machine to be easy!"
2340,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine!
Easy to learn to use, it is loud though.
Clean after every use and it lasts."
2341,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have our favorite barista in town but every since we've purchased this beast we have ""no need"" to pay $4 and $5 a pop per latte. Amazing brew flavor, great crema,...and well,,,there's no turning back!"
2342,5.0,2021-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Like a good cup of espresso, it takes time to learn this machine and enjoy the process. Beautiful and fantastic machine that will do that you want it to do. 5 stars, if you read the manual and know and practice its limitations!"
2343,5.0,2016-04-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent machine. Does require a small learning curve to get the taste you prefer for your espresso. If you enjoy your coffee, this shouldn't be an issue. Very simple to use, and the grinder works great. If you enjoy espresso and want some control on the taste of it, this is a step up from the nespresso machines and a must buy."
2344,5.0,2017-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best Expresso machine only complaint is the milk frother doesn't work as it should, takes way to long to froth."
2345,5.0,2020-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wife is very happy with 'better than coffee shop' espresso! Easy to use.
2346,4.0,2016-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wish it was a little taller. Good grinds and shot pulling ability. Steam wand always needs to be turned on for about 20sec to get a good steam stream. Over all a great machine once you get it dialed in. Expect to pull atleast 10-15 shots to figure out the settings. High quality materials.
2347,5.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,New to brewing lattes and just got this thing and it’s the perfect machine. Sturdy and it works and is very simple to use. Watched YouTube and got a foam on my first try!!! Pretty excited. Love this machine
2348,5.0,2020-07-14, Black Sesame,This is a fantastic machine for the price point. It is easy to use and operate.
2349,5.0,2017-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Probably the best espresso machine out there. It takes a bit to set it up correctly for you type of grind but once set its perfect, the taste is excellent and you get the little foam in the espresso too."
2350,5.0,2021-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love love love this machine!!! Easy to use, delicious espresso!, steamer is quick and easy! Be sure and buy good beans!"
2351,5.0,2019-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Super easy to use and great taste! Worth every penny and with the cost of one Starbucks a day it will pay for itself in three months!
2352,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"The info-mercial I watched on this machine a few years ago was insightful. After a little more research, the purchase became reality. I run our church's older LaMarrzco machine and this Breville is almost a mini of that. Easy to use and pulling shots with beans from our local espresso roaster makes a great doppio. The foaming function works well which is important to me as I like the velvety texture it gives to my latte."
2353,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a fabulous little machine. It was really quick and easy to read the instructions and get it started. Has a little guide to help you troubleshoot pulling great espresso shots. So far, we're really pleased with this purchase."
2354,5.0,2020-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it. It’s easy to use!
2355,5.0,2020-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Expensive but so worth it. Dont get pods or that Nespresso junk. This thing makes coffee as good as my local fancypants joint - now i just buy the beans from them. Everyone who uses this at my place becomes a convert - probably had 4 or 5 friends end up buying their own, which is amazing given how expensive this thing is"
2356,5.0,2019-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is no joke amazing...your going to be ruined forevermore as to what coffee is supposed to taste like...get it...don't look back
2357,1.0,2020-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Do not ignore the bad reviews!! You will end up like me. Only TWO WEEKS of use, after talking to 4 different Amazon reps for over 2 hr total, trying to reach Breville for 2 weeks straight (which they NEVER PICKED UP), finally getting my refund. It is just so unfortunate for me as I was soo excited and was looking forward to using this machine. I read bad reviews about this product but ignored them hoping I am not the unlucky one like them.. Since DAY 1, I had issues. It doesnt produce enough pressure that even at the finest grinder setting, pressure barely goes over the espresso range. I tried changing coffee beans, still espresso runs quickly and barely passes espresso range. Major problem is WATER LEAKING. Even though the days I dont use this machine, water leaks on the bottom wetting my counter and my floor!! This would have been a perfect espresso machine for me if it worked fine.. but sooo frustrated with so many issues and non-existing customer service I would NOT NOT recommend this product."
2358,5.0,2021-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Outstanding! It makes the best coffee you can think of. I’ve had it for almost a year and is working perfectly. I am super happy with it. I highly recommend it.
2359,5.0,2020-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a wonderful Latte! Highly recommend. Takes a little time to master. But when you do it is perfect.
2360,5.0,2021-02-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Lo recomiendo
2361,5.0,2019-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I loved it the second I opened it/set it up, but I waited a few months to make sure it kept working (aka the other shoe to drop). It's working great, delivers hot coffee, great crema, it really does look great - not cheaply done. There are some design features that i think are pretty cool (the magnetically stored tamper for instance). Very pleased w/ this."
2362,5.0,2020-02-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I got mine slightly used and couldn’t be happier! Everything works perfectly.
2363,5.0,2021-05-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine. My one complaint is the coffee grinder could be redesigned. Coffee beans get jammed in the hopper and do not feed all the time. Besides that one little thing..... we love it.
2364,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"this is the greatest addition to my kitchen since I bought a cast iron skillet. I would be totally lost without either one. This coffee maker is easy to use, it does everything, but most of all makes a really great cup of coffee. It is versatile enough to make whatever you like and provides the freedom to pick what ever beans you want to try. It is the best available in this midrange price."
2365,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,so far so good!
2366,2.0,2016-08-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Since we've ordered and set up this machine, the pressure gauge and getting a ""proper"" brew on espresso has never been adequate for a machine with this high a price point. At first, I thought it was user error, however, after reading the manual, watching countless YouTube videos, it hasn't gotten any better. At first it was the pressure gauge never getting quite high enough into the ideal ""espresso zone"". However now a little under 6 months in, the pressure gauge stopped working and it has zero crema at all. I've done all the proper cleaning, changed filters, altered grind size, etc. but it has been extremely dissapointing."
2367,5.0,2020-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it 10/10 would buy again.
2368,5.0,2018-02-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I'm in love with this expresso maker. Only used it for a month and a half but I would highly recommend.
2369,2.0,2021-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Just off the phone with Breville. The grinder died after 2 years and the cost to have it fixed is $239 ... Kind of a rip off at almost half the price of a new machine. I plan to buy another brand this time. This is not the machine to buy if you want to take good care of your product and expect it to last well beyond the manufacturer period of 1 year.
2370,5.0,2020-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,This brand done a good job in kitchen appliances especially in espresso maker I have been Using this brand espresso machine for 12 years.
2371,5.0,2019-11-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes consistently excellent coffee. It warms up in about 45 seconds and is ready to go. The meter allows you to determine the right grind, and the right pack to get the pressure correct... no guess work. After 4 months and lots of coffee it is proven to be very reliable and easy to clean and maintain.

The programmable settings are really useful and allow you to program all of the functions to fit your tastes and coffee.

100% satisfied... I have a new best friend."
2372,4.0,2021-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product with a learning curve on getting the grind right. The only issue has been that the durability for similar products from Breville has been an issue. We bought the extended warranty to help offset this but that becomes a hidden extra cost.
2373,5.0,2017-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use. Makes great coffee.
2374,2.0,2021-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I liked this machine while it worked. It stopped functioning, I diagnosed the problem as a bad solenoid valve. I was going to repair it. I ordered the part, only to receive an email over and over that the part was on back order. Meanwhile, this product is still available. This and a grinder are two products that I have now purchased from breville and lasted less than five years. Both products I attempted to repair and couldnt get the parts. I have replaced both products with Rancilio machines. Time will tell how they last. Off the cuff, there seems to be more metal than plastic, unlike breville."
2375,5.0,2021-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far so good. No complaints! I like how easy it is to use. My first espresso machine. I wish i decided sooner to buy it.
2376,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This was my first introduction to espresso at home and I am hooked! The machine is very easy to use and has produced the most delicious drinks I've ever had. If it broke now I would buy another!
2377,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After much research, we bought this model 6 years ago, and it finally conked out after daily use. Just bought another because this gives you the most bang for your buck, and a great coffee! Highly recommend!"
2378,5.0,2019-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,We are so happy with this expresso maker! We had a much cheaper model for many years and thought we were making expresso but really were not. This machine takes a bit of time to master but it is well worth it. The ability to make a quality expresso is amazing.
2379,5.0,2020-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"THIS MACHINE IS INCREDIBLE AND COMES WITH A MYRIAD OF OPTIONS TO ALLOW FOR PERSONAL COFFEE PREFERENCE. A BUYER MUST BE PATIENT AND WILLING TO TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN THE OPTIONS AND USE THEM. FRANKLY, IN OUR HOUSEHOLD WE ARE STILL LEARNING AND FINDING MORE WAYS TO MAKE STILL BETTER COFFEE.

EVEN SO, THE COFFEE THAT WE MAKE NOW IS EXCELLENT. THIS IS IN FACT A BARISTA'S MACHINE"
2380,5.0,2019-12-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"How did I ever live without this! I absolutely love and it worked perfectly from the first expresso made and one can easily tweak the adjustments to perfect to one's taste. It is easy to use, and I enjoy that it is not totally automatic. It looks so classic too! I just added a second bean hopper so that I can have one for regular and one for decaf coffee."
2381,1.0,2021-02-27, Black Sesame,"There are two dials to adjust grind size - one the left side of the machine and the other right underneath the dispenser. For the 1st year, the two dials worked well. After that, suddenly the one on the left side of the machine stopped working. I still can rotate the dial, but its effect is RANDOM. It's not just not working. The setting is unpredictable. Every time the left dial sets a new random size regardless of what number is chosen on it, I have to disassemble the dispenser to compensate the error. I would have requested a replacement if it had happened when the warranty was valid, but it's too late."
2382,5.0,2020-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is our first espresso machine and it works great. It needs a few minutes to warm up and get the best shot but overall a great brew. We use the hot water dispenser as much as we make espresso.
2383,5.0,2020-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,All I can say is that I don’t miss going to a coffee shop anymore this is worth every cent spend
2384,5.0,2020-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,After several attempts to get a good cup of coffee the machine delivers a consistent quality of coffee you can't get with brewed coffee. I highly recommend this product especially if you enjoy a good espresso based coffee.
2385,5.0,2019-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent product. As long as you take care of it and clean it as needed you’ll get your money’s worth.
2386,5.0,2021-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best machine ive purchased! Takes some fine tuning to make the espressi just right but so delicious and creamy!
2387,5.0,2020-11-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s been one year using these coffee machine every day and it’s awesome! We make about 30 coffees a day and it never showed any problem. The steamer works perfectly as well. I never tried the grinder because I don’t need it.
2388,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Me encanta!!!
Cafe recién molido por las mañanas"
2389,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Takes a bit to learn to use, but so far it works as expected. I use my own burr grinder instead of the one attached, as the settings are more precise on the burr grinder."
2390,1.0,2019-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought the Barista Express Espresso Machine, BES870XL after Googling the crap out of ""best home espresso machines"" and having this one come up regularly.

Huh??? Who is getting paid off to promote this terrible machine?

After a couple weeks of trial and error (different grind settings, different beans, playing around with the tamping pressure, etc) I was only getting one good shot out of every four or five (even when all the variables stayed the same). At first I assumed I was just a terrible barista, but eventually, I noticed that the pressure gauge needle wasn't moving at all, no matter what. Back it goes to amazon.

Word of advice: If, despite all the negative reviews, you decide to try your luck and purchase this product anyway, save all the packaging. Also, have someone video the process of taking it out of the box. That way when you have to send it back, you won't be pulling out your hair trying to figure out how to Tetris the machine and its accessories back into the box."
2391,5.0,2020-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So this thing makes badass espresso. Same or better quality than professional machines. The only difference with professional ones is the output potential, as far as how many cups you can make at one time. I'm utterly impressed, and I'm a total snob when it comes to good coffee"
2392,5.0,2020-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I was going to Blue Bottle coffee at $5/pop every morniing - it's so addicting. So i took the splurge on this machine and got a subscription. Now I can have it twice a day!
2393,3.0,2019-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It is a very nice machine for *espressos*!
Pulling out some nice steamed milk and froth drinks as well but it is more time consuming and the ""espresso should not wait for long"" (tip: act quickly).
I would get the double boiler version but it costs too much.
Overall, probably one of the best machines out there for home use at the price range.
No problems so far. (1 month)"
2394,5.0,2018-10-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is our 2nd edition since first purchase in 2010. It had allot of improvement and design changes. So far older model still works great and and this new edition works better. We are not ready for complete customization of espresso coffee. We are just fine by how it is easy to make a good consistent espresso coffee that is ground just before brewing.
2395,5.0,2020-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,everything about this thing is amazing. best coffee ever.
2396,5.0,2020-05-31, Black Sesame,"Wow! I love this machine, it’s a great entry/mid level machine. Easy to use and maintain. Very happy with this purchase"
2397,5.0,2020-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine is what I needed, it’s fast, easy to use and clean, noise free, and makes great espresso."
2398,5.0,2021-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had this for about a month now, absolutely love it. Go to YouTube to learn how to steam milk on this unit, I learned a lot. Use good fresh beans for that coffee cafe taste and enjoy!"
2399,5.0,2021-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine! It is the best I have ever owned and has performed flawlessly since I purchased it.
I love the different settings and I love that you could store the beans and the being hopper and then grind them as you use them; very convenient.
I got some LeVazza coffee from Amazon and reminds me of my years in Italy!
Nothing but great reviews from this user.
:-)"
2400,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this in October of 2020, at the end of August 2021 the machine does not auto stop for the single shot or double shot options. I have to manually stop it everytime. I called Breville and they have sent me the shipping label and it is covered under warranty (i'm assuming) since it is less than 1 year. Not sure what the wear and tear of shipping it to NY and back to Houston will do.

But very disappointed that this has happned. Will update my post based on the feedback i get from their service center"
2401,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far -- more than good. It took me a while to get the right settings, but once I did the espresso is as good as any I've ever had."
2402,5.0,2020-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s only been a few weeks, but so far we love it. It’s easy to use and clean."
2403,5.0,2021-04-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had a em200 cuisinart for over 3 yrs @ 4 shots 6 x a week with great results. So far this product takes me to the next level if lasts 3+yrs like my ole em200 its a true machine
2 months down love it
34 mths to go"
2404,5.0,2022-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Muy buena en construcción y manejo. Un café exquisito.
2405,5.0,2020-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Works great, no complaints."
2406,5.0,2020-06-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been a barista for over 20 years. And own my own coffee shops. Been using this machine now for a couple of months. It makes incredible espresso, Comparable to The commercial machines That coffee shop use, As far as quality of the espresso. I am very pleased with this machine."
2407,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this thing!
2408,5.0,2021-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was dreaming of this one forever, and now I know why! It is great to have the ability to pour a great espresso anytime you want. Highly recommend!"
2409,5.0,2021-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wow! I am really enjoying the espresso machine. My son is a Barista and he taught me how. If you are buying one without any knowledge, you may be a bit overwhelmed. Otherwise, the saying applies, You get what you pay for. Get a quality one like this model and you won't be dealing with issues later."
2410,5.0,2020-03-03, Black Sesame,"I love this espresso machine, it may not be a high end but it gets the job done for a at home latte. Having this at home has saved me so much $$$$.
Completely recommend it."
2411,5.0,2018-08-07, Black Sesame,Perfect!
2412,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Loving it. Still having trouble reaching the ""espresso zone"" on the pressure dial. I called their customer service, walked me through testing to make sure the pump was making pressure at all. It certainly was. We got is just about dialed in now, just took some trial/error."
2413,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works great! Takes a little to get used to if you've never used an expresso machine before.
2414,4.0,2020-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband surprised me with this ! Absolutely love it and makes delicious lattes! It’s easy to use and easy to clean and looks great !
2415,5.0,2018-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this thing, I’ve had the entry level Breville before and this is the best upgrade for coffee enthusiast. I use it every day!"
2416,5.0,2019-08-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is gorgeous and so much fun! Read the directions, play around with the settings, and you will get some yummy coffee! Another reviewer said to keep a hand towel underneath while grinding because the loose grounds can get everywhere. That has been helpful for me also. If you're on the fence, it's so worth it!"
2417,5.0,2019-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took a day of practice to use it for the very first time, but the second time it became easy and quick. I absolutely love this machine, highly recommend this."
2418,5.0,2021-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Es súper cómoda y no ocupa mucho espacio. La mejor inversión.
2419,5.0,2020-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,This makes the best espresso I've ever tasted. It takes a little personal technique and practice to get it just right. Don't buy ground coffee beans buy whole premium beans. The milk frother turns the milk into creamy foam not airy. It makes hot chocolate too. It's easy to keep clean. Watch the video a few times. You will love this machine.
2420,2.0,2021-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Multiple issues with getting pressure. Barley makes a cup when it is in two cup setting. Fresh coffee beans in machine and had a previous machine so I know how to work the machine. Only has a 30 day return on it
2421,5.0,2019-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the third Breville I have purchased and this is the Rolls Royce for Coffee espresso/coffee makers.
2422,5.0,2019-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have used it for about one month, so far so good. The best I like is the test of coffee. It is much better than
Starbucks coffee."
2423,5.0,2020-12-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had this bad boy for nearly a year. Excellent machine. High quality. The machine is heavy duty and has handled our 3-5 cup a day habit beautifully. The settings allow us to get a thick, dense shot of espresso. The steamer wand goes from room temperature to full steam in under 30 seconds. It's easy to use and maintain and looks beautiful on my countertop."
2424,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Saved a lot!!! Better from here!!!
2425,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel," I have many many Breville products and find them all to be quite wonderful so decided to stick with the brand when purchasing an espresso machine. After using it about a dozen times, I find it fails to grind the beans and have gone through every suggestion here and in the instructions to solve this problem. No luck. I might add that it is quite loud so I try not to use it in the morning when I most need espresso and my family sleeps."
2426,5.0,2021-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use. Holds plenty of beans in the hopper and let's me get lots of practice making beautiful art on steamed milk for lattes! Not to mention that it pays for itself quickly once you calculate all of those $4 coffees at the local coffee shop.
2427,5.0,2019-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is Awesome!
2428,5.0,2017-09-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Life changer! This was my first ever espresso machine purchase and it was surprisingly very easy to learn and master. The grinder is so convenient and makes for the freshest shots. The machine is very beautiful and the perfect size for our town home kitchen counter tops.
2429,5.0,2020-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been using this for several months, and I've had no problems with it yet. It's a high quality espresso machine and I'm very happy to drink an Americano in the morning instead of drip coffee :)"
2430,5.0,2020-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso maker is excellent! If you’re willing to experiment with beans, grind size, tamp force, and grind amounts, you can pull some excellent shots from the single wall filter. I usually have a latte in the morning and dopio espresso or americano in the afternoon and can’t imagine life without this machine."
2431,5.0,2016-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Prior to this purchase I always bought lower cost pump espresso machines (every couple of years) so I was somewhat apprehensive at spending so much. Given that I was getting through machines every two years I thought I'd change my approach and what a difference! I've gone from a kitchen appliance to something that looks good, produces excellent espresso, and, more importantly, demands I give it the care and attention it warrants."
2432,2.0,2021-05-04, Black Sesame,"If you look up comments about this machine on forums, you will find that many people complain that they can't get the pressure up to the espresso level without grinding a extraordinary fine grind and over packing the filer with coffee. The espresso is ok. I can't get the milk to foam. So i get a latte with warm milk. It takes a lot of time to clean it with a lot of parts. I wouldn't buy it again."
2433,5.0,2020-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This thing is awesome, watch a YouTube video on how to perfect your poison and enjoy."
2434,5.0,2017-07-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've had this Breviple Barista for a little over a week and I have to say I just love it. It fit perfectly under my cabinet. I love that it grinds the beans fresh. And it makes the most amazing tasting coffee. I wish I had bought one of these a long time ago. I'm in love ❤️ ❤️☕️
2435,5.0,2020-10-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I don't write reviews. The very first cup was rich and creamy. Exactly what I was hoping for. Similar to Starbuck's quality. So glad for this purchase. Very easy to operate. Did not need to read the manual.
2436,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This espresso machine has saved me from the daily trips I would make to my local coffee stand. In the long term I am saving a lot of money
2437,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had my Breville BES870XL for two weeks now, and I can't be any happier. I'm an espresso aficionado and this product has exceeded my expectations. It is easy to use and in few hours of practice you will be doing commercial level espresso at your home.
In-built Coffee grinder is so convenient and does the work just fine for the entry level barista like myself.
You can find more professional espresso machines in the market for sure, but no other can beat the value/price ratio of this one.Its an excellent choice."
2438,4.0,2020-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Buena máquina.
2439,5.0,2018-08-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very impressed with the quality of the machine. Works every time. No need to pay for overpriced coffee shop brew. Make sure to get quality beans. This machine exploits the difference.
2440,5.0,2016-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have been using this 4x daily for the past couple months. Excellent machine! Very happy with the purchase.
2441,5.0,2020-01-16, Black Sesame,"watch the video first, then make your first cup - excellent product - I have all my family over and its making about 12 cups each morning! each cup is near perfect - well done on a super fine machine - I am now a Breville fan, thank you."
2442,4.0,2020-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Lived up to expectations. Great espresso with minimal effort. Takes some getting used to, and adjustments are needed with different bean types to get pressure to the right level. But that's part of the fun. Enjoy!"
2443,5.0,2021-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love the coffee this machine makes!!! Worth the investment!
2444,5.0,2020-03-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I can make a good alternative instead of buying coffee from Starbucks
2445,5.0,2017-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is amazing. It has a button for everything! Super easy to use too, I didnt even have to read the directions. The steam takes a while to heat up the milk to a desired hot temperature, so I can start it and then walk go to the restroom and come back and it is still heating, but it tastes just like a coffee shop."
2446,5.0,2020-05-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"best machine ever!!!! I am using it I guess already for a year and it just works efficiently using it daily multiple times, very easy to clean, and the taste is just delicious! Game changer! Recommended it to a friend who said the same thing afterwards.
This is one product, where I can't seem to find a flaw."
2447,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Like how easy it is to use. Very good buy, probably not the best expresso that I’ve ever had.....but I didn’t have 5 grand to buy the best. For the value it is great though."
2448,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,We LOVE our Breville! So easy to use - even my kids can make coffee for our guests.
2449,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great item! Completely worth the investment. I use it every day and can make the same drinks I used to pay $6 for. It paid for itself in no time! Highly recommend.
2450,5.0,2019-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,After several years of daily use this is still going strong. I really appreciate the maintenance reminders (clean me!) and the fact that regular maintenance is easy and super cheap.
2451,5.0,2020-07-31, Black Sesame,"Minus a small manufacturers defect that the company took care of for me, this espresso machine is great for making espresso, latte, cappuccino, etc. all from the comfort of home."
2452,3.0,2018-08-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,this is my third machine the first one had a square grinding bin so it clogged a lot the 2nd one was better but the steamer gave out but this one is very loud it sounds like it is out of water all the time and the pump is working hard. I got a square trade thankfully because it seems like it might go out at anytime.
2453,5.0,2021-04-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is awesome. We now make fresh cappuccino for breakfast every morning. We've had no trouble with it at all and my wife loves trying different coffee beans for different flavors.
2454,5.0,2022-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,I can finally make a cappuccino at home like they do in the fancy coffee houses!
2455,5.0,2021-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Even after about six months of this machine, I can't think of anything that is lacking. I use it a few times per day. Makes espresso as good as the beans am can provide."
2456,3.0,2019-07-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s good for once while to drink latte and good for one person. Its not worth it to spend $500. If you’re thinking to use everyday then you have to buy cleaning kit and water filter.
2457,5.0,2018-09-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"great coffee, well made device"
2458,1.0,2019-05-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Don't waste your money. I spent 2 DAYS reading and rereading the pi$$poor instruction manual. I then tried to make coffee following the poor instructions. I can't get the pressure gauge to work no matter what. So, i ended up wasting expensive espresso beans. I followed the instructions **as they were written**. I even went on Youtube for tutorials. NO pressure to make espresso or steam the milk. Nada, zip, zilch. big fat goose egg.
Breville customer service?? HA HA HA!!! There really isn't such a thing! They're open from 6 am to 3:30 pm PST. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??

UPDATE: When I initially tried to get a replacement, the seller sent a 1 sentence message saying send it back for a refund. Total loser! Avoid this guy.

I sent it back to Breville for a replacement. I was told that it would be shipped immediately. I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. Breville claims backorder issues. I can't get a refund from Amazon sonce it's been more than 30 days. Breville will only replace, no refunds.

NEVER AGAIN. NEVER will I buy another Breville product!"
2459,4.0,2018-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We are not new to Breville as this is our 3rd unit, never had one with its own grinder an will not be without this feature in the future. After getting use to its operation there will also be no more Pods, it's very quite and easy to operate after you read the manual a bit for experiences. Would recommend this unit"
2460,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Once you buy this machine, you don't want to go back to starbucks or any other coffee place out there! I really like it because its fresh coffee and you can also steam the milk. In my opinion its much better and healthier than having starbucks or other coffee places out there. It also has the ""empty me"" tray that pops up when it needs to be emptied and cleaned. Happy with the Breville Barista Express Espresso!"
2461,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine is easy to use, produces a nice shot of espresso. Overall impressed with the purchase and would do that again."
2462,5.0,2021-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing machine
Keep in mind it is 110V incase you are using it outside the usa.
I burnt the control unit of mine since it didn't have a short circuit switch."
2463,5.0,2016-09-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update: CC called back in 5 min. problem solved

Original review:
I am extremely disappointed. The machine worked great for 4 months but today it completely stopped working suddenly.
Please resolve my issue on priority and call back on 973 652 8859"
2464,5.0,2018-04-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love my espresso machine but it had a defective pump. Breville promptly sent me prepaid priority packaging to safely return the machine to them and the repaired machine was back to me in less than one week.
2465,5.0,2019-10-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Once you have figured the correct settings on everything and set up, it is an excellent machine."
2466,5.0,2018-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Once you get it well programmed it works amazing. The cappuccino are awesome my husband loves it too..
2467,5.0,2021-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Superb!! Excellent!! High finish great coffee, best coffee machine ever. The price is awesome. high quality!!"
2468,1.0,2018-07-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Sorry the photos are sideways - I only had a minute to do this and didn't have time to figure out why they uploaded like that. OK... the espresso machine: It makes great coffee and is easy to use. It has been a life saver during COVID19 since we couldn't go out for espresso. But it is only a month since our purchase and its outside is rusting! At first I thought it was just some coffee driplets, but it does not wipe off and the smell of rust is unmistakable. We have taken excellent care of this machine during the month we have had it and have not left it wet or dirty. The exterior is clearly either not made of stainless steel, or is a really cheap grade of stainless steel. I would not recommend buying this machine. If they cheeped out on the exterior... what else did they cheap out on."
2469,5.0,2021-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use and a professional product.
2470,5.0,2021-04-20, Black Sesame,Excellent
2471,3.0,2021-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When I push ahead portafilter today, it can not grind coffee bean. I purchased it less than one year, please advise how to claim the one year warranty."
2472,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love Breville, this is my third machine, they are well made and durable. The machine does the job and more... plain simple you will get a real espresso just like Starbucks and other coffee shops."
2473,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This has been a great machine and lots of fun for the holidays. Beware cappuccinos are addictive 😊🍵🍵
2474,3.0,2019-12-26, Black Sesame,I'm still getting use to the machine but I've having trouble dialing in the perfect cup. The pressure gauge worked the first week or so... but now it never reaches the perfect blend zone. That's making it hard to get the grind right since the time of the output and the color indicate that there's too much pressure while the pressure gauge says otherwise. If I don't get it dialed in within the next week I'm returning it.
2475,5.0,2019-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing!! The bean grinder on top is so convenient. It's a bit intimidating but worth figuring out. My sons (cappo experts, lol) visit and we (husband and I) have impressed them with this buy. It looks really clean and it makes DELICIOUS cappos and espressos. I've gotten so picky with my beans!"
2476,5.0,2019-11-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Sounds like a Space Shuttle launch. The milk steamer has a nice bass rhythm and I was able to achieve ear splitting screams that exceeded 120 decibels. My pets ran and hid in fear.♥️😎
2477,5.0,2019-07-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife and I were spending minimum 50 dollars per month in coffee, and it wasn't always that great. Ever since we purchased this we have used it enough that it has paid for its self. And we always have great tasting coffee."
2478,5.0,2021-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I've had this machine for two weeks now. I've used it at least twice a day. I'm still getting the hang of pulling the perfect shot and making perfect foam, but non the less she is still making great espresso.

I love it, my favorite thing in the kitchen."
2479,5.0,2020-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the best expresso machine you will get a as a beginner! I highly recommend.
2480,3.0,2021-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Considering I have bought 2 of the same model Breville maker both leak water from the left side of the machines when facing you, now it will leak at different times so it's not as immediate as to happen once you use it but typically you will find water by the machine when not in use or shortly after you use it. It's a little irritating but all Breville will do is say ship it back blah blah then a month later you call back with the same problem."
2481,1.0,2019-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased the Barista BES 870XL in October of 2020, the first six months it worked great, but since then I have gone through multiple seals. Twice I ordered seals from Breville and twice they sent me the wrong seals. Even with the proper seal it still sprays water all over the counter, its a 600.00 piece of garbage and their customer service is deplorable.!!"
2482,5.0,2021-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love love love love love!!! By far the best espresso machine we have purchased. I have used this since mothers day several times a day. It is very easy to use and easy to clean. It makes great espresso! If you have ever been a barista this will make you feel at home!!
2483,5.0,2018-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As a newbie espresso connoisseur, this product is easy to use and makes the feeble handed seem extraordinary"
2484,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've been making espresso every morning for 5 years. My trusty machine finally died so I decided to move up to this machine. It significantly improved the quality and consistency of my coffee. You won't be disappointed!
2485,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this thing! I have had it now for about a month and use it every day. It makes perfect cappuccinos every time. I quit going to the coffee shop since getting the Breville. I don't have anything negative to say about it.
2486,5.0,2016-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very consistent quality cup to cup, easy to use once I played with the grind and different brands-the process itself is not terribly complicated, just need to be patient while you figure out what works for you"
2487,5.0,2018-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far I really love this machine! I can have a delicious latte at home!
2488,5.0,2020-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the greatest thing in my kitchen! Easy to use and strong espresso! I love this machine!
2489,2.0,2019-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,I just used the machine for 4 months and it started to have air leaking problem when making a coffee. I am also not satisfied with Breville customer service who is not very patient which makes me very upset. I also need to pay myself for the replacement. I would not recommend this product.
2490,5.0,2020-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,It works and taste way beyond expectations. Am so happy my daughter wanted it! Now I can't wait to use it every day!
2491,3.0,2020-03-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just started using the espresso machine yesterday even though I purchased it early August. The pressure gauge does not work at all!! I am contacting Breville customer support to see if they can help with the repair. This pressure gauge is needed to determine if the espresso liquid itself is within quality parameters. Hard to troubleshoot grind, grind amount, etc. levels without pressure gauge."
2492,5.0,2021-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing product
Unlimited potential to adjust your coffee texture
Best latte’s ever made with that machine"
2493,5.0,2020-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Several house guests and after one demo they were all able to make their own. Now when I travel I hate to leave the espresso machine at home.
2494,1.0,2020-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"In a nutshell this is an expensive Made in China piece of junk. I'm not in the habit of writing product reviews, but after just having hung up the phone with Breville customer service, consumers must know what a poor product this is and what poor service is offered. After 16 months the machine pump no longer functions and I have been told that since the 1 year warranty is expired, my $550 espresso machine will cost $250 to repair plus shipping, for a grand total of about $350.00. It's obviously not even worth fixing since the repair is ⅔ the cost of the original machine. This means that this machine is now scrap metal. Breville machines are Made in China. They may look nice on the outside, but they are poorly manufactured. Despite relatively light use and the regular maintenance that i performed diligently, the machine broke down anyway. I have a close relative who purchased this same machine and is now having the same mechanical failure after a little less than 2 years. I believe that he has also submitted a negative review for this product."
2495,5.0,2018-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,great lattes and cappuccinos
2496,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Awesome. Mostly mechanical parts so not too worried about digital components going haywire. Steamer is more than adequate for texturing milk. Great tasting lattes, better than spending $5 at Starbucks for their nasty coffee every morning."
2497,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,My coffee/espresso never tasted better! I just love this machine and so much better having it right here in my kitchen then having to run out to get coffee! Best coffee/espresso I ever had!! Very happy!!!
2498,5.0,2019-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After several try, The machine makes perfect expresso."
2499,5.0,2020-02-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,I had read all the great reviews and waited to pull the trigger. Wish I had purchased a year ago. So simple and quality espresso pull.
2500,5.0,2018-05-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use and incredible quality espressos. Sure it's expensive but it saves my wife from buying $6 drinks at the coffee shops over even a year.
2501,1.0,2018-03-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worked well for 3 months, took great care of it, cleaned it as recommended, then it stopped heating water. The thermocoil that heats the water burned out after only 3 months with normal use. Avoid, contacted seller and they advised to go direct with Breville.
update:
Breville's customer service was excellent and had a quick turn around. They fixed/replaced parts in the machine and had it back to us 6 days after shipping. Bumped the rating up because of their customer service."
2502,5.0,2021-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Decided after our old brew pot died to indulge in this machine after reading all the reviews for this and many others. It has performed flawlessly over the past month with almost daily use. Already had to do our first cleaning which it automatically notified us it was do. Took a time or two to adjust the grind amount and fineness to our tastes but have it down. Very pleased with the purchase and look forward to a long life together.
2503,5.0,2020-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love, love, love this machine! My first espresso maker and it's been very easy to learn to use."
2504,5.0,2021-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Overall my daughter is very happy with the machine which is what is most important, that she's happy."
2505,2.0,2020-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This product brewed pretty good for 3 weeks, then the quality went down hill. Doesn’t brew in espresso mode anymore."
2506,5.0,2021-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,One of the best purchases ever! Easy to use and clean. Mine has been used 5-7 days a week for two years and have not had one issue. Well worth the money!
2507,3.0,2019-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very disappointed in this product. After 1 year main electronic board burned out. For $600 it should last a lot longer then that for sure
2508,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,User friendly and makes delicious coffee
2509,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Our Breville espresso machine has performed flawlessly! We love the ease of use (once you get used to it) and the consistency of each cup of coffee. You'll make your money back quickly, too!"
2510,5.0,2020-03-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First time Coffee maker and very essy to use.
Does a great job, so far no issues."
2511,4.0,2022-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this coffee machine, easy to use and makes great coffees.
Only issue we have had is with the grinder keeps clogging up on us
called Breville and they said we were using too oily of beans we were using
Starbucks so we tried some lighter brown non oily beans instead still no
better. We are now using a separate grinder."
2512,5.0,2019-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,It took a little bit to get it right. This machine is awesome!
2513,5.0,2020-02-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been making 2-4 doubles a day with the Nespresso machine.$$$$$$ for the pods. This unit makes better coffee. It really takes no longer, and there are more variations to experience. It is worth the initial outlay of money. It will pay for itself in a few months."
2514,1.0,2020-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Seriously, where is the quality control with the cost of this espresso maker. I have two other Breville products and no issues. The scratches on the stainless steel drip tray is very noticeable and should not have been there on a brand new item. I am giving 1 star because I tried to contact Breville on their website but the ""support"" form wanted to know everything but my social. Even after filling out all the info on their form I could not submit it because of the stupid setup to upload images failed and reset the entire form. Contacting product support should not be a hassle people not when you ask customers to pay a premium for a premium product. I know some people may think I should suck it up, but if I spend this much on a brand new item, I expect it to be in perfect condition. Scratches on stainless steel are very noticeable and annoying.

Update: The review is not even published as yet and it looks like the pressure gauge is not working!"
2515,5.0,2020-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just replaced my coffee maker with the Barista Express and have great espresso, latte and Americanos."
2516,5.0,2020-12-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is super easy to use makes great coffee heats up quick definitely worth the price !!!!
2517,5.0,2021-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Little bit of a learning curve for us novices, but Cafe quality drinks. It looks beautiful and is made solid. Just about commercial grade. A lovely Christmas gift for your Mocha monster."
2518,5.0,2020-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After a little dialing-in with my beans, I had a great shot within minutes after delivery. I did watch every video possible on YouTube beforehand, so that helped, of course. Couldn’t be happier."
2519,3.0,2021-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We are HUGE Breville fans! However, if you don't have a lot of time to make your espresso in the morning, you may want the more expensive version of this one... we liked the espresso but it took my husband about 1 hour to make espresso for both of us... we just can't wait that long in the morning...
we own many breville products (blender, panini maker, juicer, etc.) we wish we had the time to spend with this but unfortunately, we had to send it back... :O("
2520,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have owned this for 6 years now with no issues. Best machine I ever bought.
2521,1.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"This espresso machine served me well for almost a full year. Now, exactly 14 months later, the pressure gauge is not working. Also, there is no crema with the pour and the two-cup dispenser is delivering only one ounce of espresso instead of two. The one-cup dispenser is delivering only about 1/2 ounce. Not sure what the problem is and will have to call the manufacturer to solve. I did call and talked to a very nice, polite person who is looking at my case as a warranty case. Very disappointed to have such an expensive piece of equipment fail so soon. Also, the quantity of the grind is the same regardless of the setting of the know which supposedly allows one to adjust the grind amount. Also, at the person's suggestion, I did descale the machine and now getting the correct volume of pour from both the one-cup and the two-cup dispenser. Still no movement on the pressure gauge nor is the grind volume adjustment working. And too, there is no appreciable about of crema."
2522,5.0,2019-05-15, Black Sesame,"It’s pretty expensive and bulky but this produces professional grade espressos. You just need practice for the extraction and pours. Not easy to make the perfect pour but loads of fun.
Easy to actually use but it’s an art form."
2523,5.0,2021-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it. Use it everyday (multiple times per day) Bye Starbucks!!
2524,5.0,2018-06-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Took me a while to figure out the grind size, the tamping and everything else!"
2525,5.0,2018-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is amazing. Easy to learn and use. I’ve used this machine several times since I’ve gotten it and have also saved a lot of money not going to coffee shops.
2526,5.0,2019-11-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"OMG!best investment we've made...not a expresso machine expert, but for a first time buyer, its not bad. however, the steamer is a bit weak and it take about 20 seconds more to heat up milk than a 5000 dollar expresso machine, its well worth the buy (because of the functionality)."
2527,3.0,2016-05-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,There is something wrong with the machine. How to guarantee it? Please let me know and contact me.
2528,5.0,2020-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,My favorite part of my morning is to make a cup of coffee. The machine comes with so many different options. Only hard part of the machine is figuring out how to adjust to perfect shot of espresso. Once you got that down everything else comes easy! Perfect cup everytime.
2529,5.0,2019-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Fabulous service and fast shipping. These are excellent Espresso makers. Long lasting, easy to maintain and make wonderful coffee!! Seriously, this machine is the..Bomb!!"
2530,5.0,2020-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing espresso machine. I have used it with different beans. Always comes up absolutely fantastic. Milk frothier tquierea practice. So I use a separate frothier that is super consistent. Love it!!!!!
2531,1.0,2020-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really enjoyed my Breville BES870XL Barista Express Espresso machine while it worked but unfortunately it is no longer usable as the water reservoir drains onto my counter top over night and during operation. The leak is coming from within the unit and may not be visible until it gets bad (the puddles start small and are hidden by the large footprint of the machine). I implore all users to notify the manufacturer as soon as you observe this defect (check underneath the machine NOW) as they are rather strict about their limited 1 yr warranty. A repair of the device will cost nearly $250 dollars which simply means I will purchase a different brand altogether and write this manufacturer off my list of preferred brands. The Breville Customer service center states this is an issue that occurs but since it is outside of warranty no remedy is available. Again, please ensure you inspect for water leakage NOW and notify Breville immediately so you won't end up stuck with a defective product. The water will leak, and it will get worse. Lesson learned, no more Breville products in my house."
2532,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am in love with my Barista Express! It’s absolutely amazing. So easy to use. The quality of the product is spot on. Use my machine every day.
2533,4.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Excellent machine once you get it set up and adjusted for the coffee beans you are using. What a difference in the taste of the expresso this machine makes over cheaper units.
2534,5.0,2022-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I like everything about the Breville and I use it daily for fixing my favorite cappuccino.
2535,5.0,2018-07-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"very well made and packaged. Makes great coffee. Realtively easy to use, though there is a bit of a learning curve in grinding the right amount of coffee and getting the tamping right, but once mastered it works great."
2536,5.0,2019-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,After visiting Italy this past summer we wanted to make espressos & cappuccinos at home and this seemed to be the best product to do so. I would recommend this Espresso Machine.
2537,5.0,2021-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product
2538,1.0,2020-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was so eager to get this machine and it made great espresso but unfortunately my foaming wand and hot water dispenser were not working properly. I worked directly with Breville and they suggested I return it when it was determined the problem.
So sadly I returned it. I think this particular machine was just an anomaly."
2539,5.0,2021-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this thing!!! A bit of a learning curve when it comes to the Tamping. Since I got this in February I have only gone to the local coffe shop once, where I used to go 4-5 times a week!"
2540,1.0,2020-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was the biggest splurge appliance of my life. Was so excited to get it, and enjoyed it immensely for a mere 22 days. At that point, the grinder stopped working. I spent hours reading instruction and watching Youtube videos trying to fix, to no avail. Now for the Breville customer service experience...I have called four times. They are only open 8 hours Pacific Time Mon-Fri. I got on a queue for them to call me back. I waited nearly two hours for a call back, but when they finally called, I couldn't answer as I was driving and they would require numbers I would have to read. I queued up again to be called back shortly after that. I have now waited another two hours with no call back. I feel like a fool for spending this ridiculous amount of money on a malfunctioning appliance. So disappointed. Wish I never purchased this item."
2541,5.0,2020-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Seldom am I so pleased with a purchase as I've been with this EXCELLENT appliance!! It's an aazing machine that makes amazing espresso with very little effort - a pleasure to use, easy to maintain -- I highly recommend it: Bravo Breville!"
2542,5.0,2020-11-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best investment we ever made. We can have freshly grounded good coffee everyday! So worth the price.
2543,5.0,2021-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Within 5 minutes you have espresso or cappuccino that rivals coffees from cafes located in Italy
2544,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very well made, good job team brewville, small compact and easy to use and clean."
2545,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Instead of going out and buying a expensive Espresso I decided to get my very own Espresso Machine. Time and Time again came out just as good as the ones you get from a Good Esspresso stand. Best when I make a small shot for on the go.
2546,5.0,2020-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the first espresso machine we have ever purchased and we absolutely love it! The quality is incredible and the instructions included have allowed us to easily learn how to utilize this machine to its fullest potential. Extremely happy with our purchase.
2547,5.0,2021-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Super easy to get a great espresso with a nice crema, I read a couple of reviews saying that it was complicated to get the best of these machine but I tell you, it is very easy to get a nice espresso.
It was so good since the begining that the day I got it I drank too much caffeine, it was a very intense afternoon! but I regret nothing!"
2548,4.0,2020-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have been using this at my business for a couple of months and I'm very happy with it. The steam wand could have a bit more juice behind it. But overall a solid performer.
2549,5.0,2020-02-06, Black Sesame,"Words don’t accurately describe this machine!! It’s like having a piece of Italy 🇮🇹 in your kitchen.
FYI... better experience you must have different types of coffee beans that agree with your pallet."
2550,5.0,2019-06-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great espresso machine. Only complaint, boiler takes a very long time to heat up to where the pressure gauge moves to the middle of the dial."
2551,5.0,2019-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,This has been a great purchase. If you are used to buy espressos on coffee shops you will get similar quality with it. Also you will recoup it's value in less than a year with the amount of money you will save.
2552,5.0,2020-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best coffee maker I've owned till now.
Grinder works well.
Feels like quality parts.
Steamer is perfect and I can't fault it. Turns all angles and ready to work almost immediately.
Coffee extraction is great.
Has just the right features for those that are new to making espresso and need help from the automatic features to more advance users who want manual control."
2553,1.0,2021-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine broke down in 6 months and there is no support from Breville with regard to the machine. I tried everything from calling them, sending in tickets after tickets, getting all the subsidiaries in US, Australia and MY to respond, and 3rd party to get the pump EP5 110V to replace the faulty pump but to no avail.

The part offered by all the third parties do not conform to this particular part and I have wasted hundreds of dollars trying to fix the machine and it has turned out to be a disaster for me, having the warranty expiring half way through this battle with the customer support and third parties (i.e. BigWareHouse or WarehouseSpares) who don't give a damn about the specs and gave all kinds of excuses for their incompatible parts or non-delivery. I advise you not to buy it because if it breaks down, and it will, you have zero help from Breville."
2554,5.0,2019-05-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use. `Makes the yummiest, creamiest coffee right in your own kitchen!"
2555,5.0,2020-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After my wife and I ran a coffee shop for five years we had often missed the treat a real espresso machine provided. That was is until we purchased the Breville 870. It works as well as our $10,000 High end Italian machine we used in the store. Almost to good to be true."
2556,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This product is perfect..I bought it as a birthday gift for my hubby..it is easy to use and the coffee it makes is so delicious..really love it^ ^
2557,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very disappointed. Very complex to use. I have been trying to get the esspresso to come out not tasting better or correctly for over 3 months now. I tried returning it or excahing it and they would allow me because it was last the date. It’s very expensive and not happy with it at all. Before you you purchase make sure you practice the machine somehow and have time to learn it. I have three kids and wanted a nice Easter eco machine to make lattes etc. now it just sits on the counter and looks pretty. That’s about it. 700.00 down the drain. Completely bummed.
2558,5.0,2018-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,If anyone can be in love with an espresso machine... count me in
2559,5.0,2015-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love my coffee machine every time I make a cup. Easy to use, easy to clean. Plenty of ways to adjust the type of coffee made. Best coffee in town!"
2560,5.0,2019-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine. Expensive initially, but no more pods, so end run will be less cost. Best beans requires some experimentation but worth it!"
2561,5.0,2020-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,No more Starbuck for me. This is easy to use and everything works great.
2562,2.0,2014-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Grinder switch just stopped working. Loved the machine otherwise but after 3 months use at 2 cups per day, the grinder switch just stopped working. This malfunction makes the whole system useless. Sending back today. Sad, I thought this one was the best out there. Only 3 month life."
2563,5.0,2019-08-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I absolutely adore the Barista Express, by far one the best purchase’s I made this year"
2564,4.0,2020-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,This was a Christmas 🎅 present 🎁 for my husband and he absolutely love it except for it's kind of messy. Other than that you'll definitely get a quality coffee ☕.
2565,5.0,2020-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is so cool and thoughtfully made. So many neat features from the hidden storage to the floating sight that says Empty when the over flow ray gets too full.
2566,5.0,2019-10-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, looks nice and perfect for the purpose of use in a small art gallery."
2567,5.0,2019-02-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the excellent Coffee maker
2568,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Daughter loves it. Uses every day. Fabulous wedding gift.
2569,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this for my husband for Father's Day. He was a bit overwhelmed by the process to make the expresso-but now he LOVES it!
2570,5.0,2017-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it! I use it every morning, then again to travel with a coffee."
2571,5.0,2017-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"love this. for some reason, it came used ... it was a little wet out the outside and the filter was installed (and wet) ... that was disappointing, but I figured it would be a huge hassle to get a new one ... so I just dealt with it ... probably shouldn't have, but, it makes great coffee. i had the model before it and loved that one too."
2572,5.0,2016-01-14, Black Sesame,My wife loves this machine. Uses it twice a day for 2 doubles. She never makes a regular cup of coffee anymore. It was pretty easy for her to learn to use.
2573,5.0,2021-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,I save soooo much time making my own espresso!! This machine was super easy to learn how to use. I watched a 10 minute YouTube video and now I feel like a barista!
2574,5.0,2022-07-05, Black Sesame,"so far, so good. Everything works great."
2575,5.0,2019-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best espresso machine ever. I am a big coffee stand freak and thought I would buy this to help save some money and I am so glad I did. The shots taste exactly like any coffee stand. Would highly recommend this to anyone.
2576,5.0,2016-04-30, Black Sesame,"Absolutely love it! Built-in grinder makes a huge difference for the quality of espresso. Pressure gauge is also key to adjust grind/tampering and to know which beans are better for espresso. The only downside is the noise, but for the price, I wouldn't expect more."
2577,2.0,2021-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve owned this machine for one week and I have had take apart the coffee grinder and clean out the twice. I bought it after hearing and watching friends who raved over it for years and was told they never had any issues. I bought and tried the same coffee brand as they used so I know they oils in the coffee aren’t the issue. I read many reviewers who had issues with the coffee grinder but based on my friends experience I thought it was going to be fine. unfortunately that’s not the case. I’m very disappointed. If I had bought it at a store, I would have taken it back immediately!"
2578,3.0,2019-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel," Loved this machine....until it stopped working correctly after about 2 weeks. On some shots, the pump had big swings in pressure. To Breville's credit, their customer service was swift and they offered to replace the machine. Returned to Amazon by that point for the refund. So great service from both. Not sure what to look at now....still considering another try on this one but $600 is a hefty purchase after having an issue. How is everyone fairing with their machines now? Still recommend them?

Thanks."
2579,5.0,2019-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,It works real good! I would recommend it....would be nice if cleaning up the bottom tray would clean better but it still is not that bad
2580,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased Breville BES870BSXL The Barista Express last Christmas, using it every day, sometimes twice a day and it runs as new, no problems whatsoever. Didn't have coffee machines before so can not really compare to others. I use it with a transformer on 220-240V"
2581,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Very nice intro to espresso machines. The savings on pods/capsules is noticeable.
2582,5.0,2020-07-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this 5 years ago and have made a minimum of 8 shots per day... that is a minimum of 7,300. The grind is perfect, the pressure creates a rich crema on top. All of our friends love our coffee. If you are on the fence because of the price, JUST DO IT."
2583,5.0,2021-03-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s really enjoyable espresso machine and I love it
2584,5.0,2021-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing cafe-quality coffee at home. Easy to use and fantastic performance. Love it!
2585,5.0,2018-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought for my husband and he loves it! Great product. Would purchase again.
2586,5.0,2019-04-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to figure out! Was worried it would be complicated and difficult. It’s not. Works great for iced coffee and hot coffee. Hot water for americanos and steam feature for
Mochas. Very satisfied"
2587,5.0,2021-04-29, Black Sesame,"I love this machine - easy to use, reliable, excellent espresso, beautiful milk foam."
2588,5.0,2021-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was my very first espresso machine. In fact the very first latte that I ever tasted was the one I made with this machine. I don't know how mine compares to the ones that professionals make, but mine is certainly the best I ever tasted :-)"
2589,5.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine, too bad it went on sale over the fourth of July for $90.00 less than I paid for it! Wait for it to go on sale and you will absolutely love the espresso shots."
2590,4.0,2020-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"amazing, compact, easy to use."
2591,5.0,2022-08-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Impressive, makes great lattes."
2592,4.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,So far we love it at the office the quality of espresso is like been in Italy. I would recommend it to anyone of our friends
2593,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this for almost three years, using it daily. I love this machine. Recommend it to anyone.

UPDATED: It has been six years since I bought this machine and it is as good as when I bought it. I use it daily and love my morning ritual!"
2594,5.0,2021-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Definitely a very well thought through Espresso Machine!! It has it all, and you can't beat the price! Nothing has broken for me, but if you are worried about it, by the extended 4 year warranty, and it'll still be much cheaper than anything else in it's class and yet just as quality!"
2595,3.0,2020-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine! Overall, I love it. However, The water tank is super small and requires constant filling."
2596,5.0,2016-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this to replace a cheaper delonghi machine which had started delivering inconsistent shot quality. With a few tries with the breville, I was able to consistently produce great quality shots at the proper pressure and they tasted great! The whole machine is a thing of beauty, with every step carefully thought out. Even the waste reservoir has a sign that floats into view when it needs to be emptied. The quality and design warrant the price."
2597,5.0,2020-11-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely LOVE this machine!! All I have to do is push a button! Super easy to clean! (The machine does all the work for you)
2598,5.0,2020-11-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Went from Keurig to Nespresso to this... and what a difference! It really isn't complex, the coffee is so much better... and you'll save a ton of money buying coffee beans instead of pods. I could never go back."
2599,5.0,2020-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing Espresso Machine! Had it now for 2 weeks, and I don't miss my coffee maker one bit. Has already saved me money, I'd rather have my caffeine fix with it then with Starbucks simply because it tastes the same if not better! Super easy to keep clean and just looks nice on my counter!"
2600,5.0,2020-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this for my husband. We can now get a quality latte/espresso from home.
2601,3.0,2015-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Several parts to clean and must purchase expensive filters etc with the machine.
2602,5.0,2021-01-28, Black Sesame,I love the idea of making ourselves a cappuccino any time we feel like it! One negative- the beans tend to clog in the hopper and delay the process.
2603,5.0,2014-12-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Took some getting use to grind size and tamping to get to right espresso extract but we have it dialed in and love it so far... been using for about 3 months daily with no issues - not sure we ever want to go back to fully automated - working for you coffee makes you appreciate it more ;)
2604,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have purchased a number of Breville products and over the last few years thei customer service has become nothing than a prerecorded message that talks about the many calls it gets and never answers. This situation is something that has plagued them long before the pandemic. Other companies and services have been able to adjust to the challenges. Not Breville, and it disgust me that they disappearing from their responsibilities to customers. I’ve phoned, left numbers, tried live chat but was clocked out, and emailed over the last four days, and nothing. Oh, maybe I should’ve tried carrier pigeon. This all makes no sense. Are they trying to sour and turn faithful customers, like myself, away. Don’t know how faithful I can remain given this careless and perfidious lack of service."
2605,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great, once you master it, follow instructions, move in small increments."
2606,2.0,2021-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this Oct 26, 2019. The pump & solenoid need replacing. This must be a common issue because there are multiple YouTube clips dedicated to diagnosing the issue & replacing the parts yourself.

Can’t get a stream of water out of the water spout, it spits violently & pulsates. You can hear the pump struggling. At $700-800 this shouldn’t be an issue after only 2 years.

A final note, it’s in our bedroom not the kitchen because it’s so loud it woke up our housemates. Regrettable purchase."
2607,5.0,2020-01-27, Black Sesame,Can’t get enough of it
2608,1.0,2021-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Paid big bucks for this machine. My espresso was room temperature unless I steamed or frothed milk/cream to make it hotter. I paid hundreds of dollars for this machine and ended up having to microwave my espresso every morning. I sent it in for a repair and they sent it back saying they had cleaned it. It didn't need cleaning, it needed the temperature control to be adjusted. (Yes, I tried the machine's temperature control...elevating the temp by 4 degrees....didn't help) Impersonal and ineffective service. The customer service rep said to me that my 'hot' may be different than some other person's 'hot'. She said that they purposefully don't have a high temperature for the water because most experts believe 'hot' ruins the espresso beans. I owned a Starbucks BARISTA machine for over 20 years and it made piping hot espresso every morning....guess I am not an 'expert'. Sadly, I had to return it. It had lots of bells and whistles and I really wanted to enjoy this product."
2609,3.0,2020-07-14, Brushed Stainless Steel," This machine makes really great espresso, but we were quite disappointed with the steamer. For the price, I expected a better quality steamer, but as you can see in the video, it takes several seconds before anything happens then it sputters out water then finally steam. It also doesn't work well with heavy cream. We still enjoy the machine, but my husband likes americanos with a little steamed heavy cream, so we can't use the steamer as we hoped to."
2610,5.0,2018-02-28, Black Sesame,We have had this for a month or so and we LOVE it. We use it every morning. It makes a great espresso and the learning curve is easy. The steamer is wonderful. It's been fun getting different beans and learning how to make a balanced espresso drink.
2611,5.0,2020-10-07, Black Sesame,"Got this for our 16 wedding anniversary gift to each other. We use it everyday and love it. We get locally roasted beans and the results with this machine have been excellent. Haven't had better espresso, mochas, or lattes any where else before."
2612,5.0,2020-07-10, Black Sesame,"My wife often asks, “how do you have so much energy?” And I respond by gesturing toward the Breville. It does what it’s supposed to I guess."
2613,3.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine came with 110v.
When shipping outside the USA, it should have been considered to ship with 220v
I had to buy aadditional 180$ transformer 😕"
2614,5.0,2020-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I debated buying this espresso machine for a long time. I am so glad I did. No regrets!!!
2615,5.0,2018-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it
2616,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Unfortunately the machine came damaged, upon doing all the pre step checks as indicated in the instruction, the machine leaked all over. We tried all the steps per instructions and company site but it still leaked. We could see the leak was coming from one of the seams on the left bottom side of the machine. We returned it with the intention of getting a replacement as indicated on the Amazon site but it was declined after entering all the information. We were only able to get a full refund with no replacement option…"
2617,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! Easy to use. Enjoy several types of espresso drinks with this unit.
2618,3.0,2019-04-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great Machine but very unreliable, it makes great coffee but requires a lot of maintenance. Breville company support is very weak, they will not stand by their product and will point you to their website to view videos and give run around. If you can maintain it and have light use, this machine is for you. If you are a heavy user, you can be sure to be running to repair shops ot trashing the unit after 1 year or so."
2619,1.0,2020-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I received the Breville, with a problem with the grinder almost out of the box. I took it apart, per the cleaning process, with the problem occurring a couple of more times in the first month. It was purchased for me around Thanksgiving, and given to me at Christmas. The problems with the grinder occurred again, with my following the process yet again. It is now two days past return, and the grinder does not work. It jams, with a very notable noise indicating that the beans are jammed. I now have an expensive Espresso unit that only make espresso, and does not grind. I will try to make contact to see if there is a repair available. I will update this should I have any positive resolution. If not, if the grinder so much as hiccups at any time, I would return the unit. I do love the espresso though. It makes a great product...now I am using a cheap twenty dollar grinder."
2620,3.0,2018-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Has many features of a commercial espresso machine packaged in a cheap home appliance. Using the same coffee beans, my espresso tastes better in my Italian made ESE machine. This one is also much slower. You can find a Grimac ESE machine that will have much higher consistency day in day out than this machine for the same price."
2621,3.0,2021-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"makes good espresso but for some reason water leaks from the base under the machine. I always have to mop up after I am done. I wanted to unscrew the back and check the seals but it was impossible to get into.. also the pressure gauge doesn't work, it never moves.. very frustrating that something comes and leaks and was $550+"
2622,1.0,2017-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,This broke down(the heater element) just before the 2 year mark are light to moderate use. You'd expect better way quality for this price. The square trade warranty is a joke. Everyone at square trade is clueless and could care less since they all live a continent or two away. I just noticed that they sent me an email stating that my replacement TV is on the way!! ( never got the TV though..) I've had to call these people mulltiple times and spent at least 2 hours on the phone and now I'm waiting for them to call me back for hopefully some type of resolution. Wish me luck!!
2623,5.0,2020-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,I got this as a gift from my husband in October and forgot to write a review. It has been working great and the espresso tastes delicious! I use it every day :) I would highly recommend!
2624,5.0,2019-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I Received the Breville BES870XL one month ago and it has worked as expected, at the beginning I had some trouble with the optimal pressure but I took care buy lowering the grind size. Its very good get used to it and works fine and looks fine also."
2625,5.0,2019-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,After TONS of research and analyzing reviews I decided to take the plunge. I learned there is a secret to making this machine work well. Read the instructions and follow them. I did everything the booklet suggested and watched the video on line. My machine is working great and produces an amazing coffee.
2626,5.0,2017-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far I am loving it!!! Still fine tuning my shots and it's so much fun! Missed being a barista so this is pretty dang close.

Update: The shots are down and I am still enjoying this so much!!!"
2627,5.0,2019-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Had this machine for three years now with daily use by working college students. We tried many different types of beans untill we found a really tasty one that this machine still produces perfect shots three years later! Highly recommend this machine. Wish i would have bought the dual boiler version though.
2628,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this machine, but alas, it is a dud. With the single shot filter, it was able to get up to pressure and yield good espresso half the time. With the double shot filter, it resulted in practically no pressure and runny espresso. I did follow the guidance of the other reviewer here regarding using the cleaning shield + foil etc, which worked (kinda), but the double shot just never gets up anywhere near the espresso pressure range. I also tried playing with the dose, the grind coarse/fine (tried fine, tried a high enough dose to just allow locking with firm pressure). Too hard to use, too inconsistent, messy. That's not fun to me. I'm not a barista. I like great espresso, but I'm not a coffee artisan and honestly I don't really want to be. If you're going to spend this kind of money on a machine, I'd go with a one touch (like a Saeco with the detachable milk pitcher that you can store in the fridge), which is probably what I'm going to do when I return this one."
2629,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am in love of this machine. Pair it with good quality beans and you will know what coffee is supposed to taste like (yes, I am a frequent Starbucks patron and it does not even come close to the results I get with this one). Very easy to use even for a relatively new coffee snob such as me."
2630,5.0,2015-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Coffee has never tasted so good
2631,5.0,2019-02-27, Black Sesame,So simple to use yet so professional!!
2632,5.0,2020-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This offers a degree of control and performance I could not get with the Rancilio Silvia using an inadequate grinder. Though not built like a tank, with mindful care I'm anticipating a long counter life in my kitchen. It has temperature control, pressure monitor, and shot volume adjustment to tweak one's skills to barista competence. I've only had this a month, so in two years time durability of materials and construction will begin to be known. So far, all good!"
2633,5.0,2021-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’m absolutely loving my new Breville!! Easy to use! I just need to practice my Latte “art” more.
So far, everything is as was expected with this product. Love it!!"
2634,5.0,2016-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I use this thing a lot. It can be a bit flakey (about the amount of coffee that comes out, about whether it needs to be cleaned, etc) but I use it a *lot* and I enjoy it."
2635,1.0,2019-06-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Do not buy this product - I just purchased this machine and I was excited to get it after reading the good reviews. However, it is a big expensive disappointment - the machine gets clogged almost every day and has to be taken apart to clean the grinding part of the machine - this includes removing the hopper, remove the upper burr, unscrew the nut and remove washers, remove the lower burr, clean and vacuum the residue to unclogged the machine, place everything back to original set... by the time you are done doing all this, you just want to take this barista express machine and put it in the garbage. $700 dólar mistake. I contacted the company and no response so far. I want my money back."
2636,4.0,2018-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The cup warming part on top is made of plastic while other parts are stainless steel.
Overall, satisfied. It's been about 4 months, and so far so good."
2637,5.0,2017-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it. It's exactly what I want in an expresso maker. I use it several times a week. Still works like new. Hope it lasts forever. A bit pricey but am glad I spent the money.
2638,1.0,2019-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine lasted about 11 months working great. Once the problems started (low pressure), I was forced to attempt to contact customer service. Absolute nightmare.

Day 1: ""Pressed 5"" to have them call me back. No call in two days.
Day 2: Waited for an hour before speaking with Sandra, who said she was having system problems, put me on hold for 20 minutes, dropped the call, and never called back.
Day 3: Waited for 45 minutes before talking to Selia?, who suggested the problem was that my beans were roasted over 5 days ago. (REALLY?!?!) She organized a service pick-up, without really organizing, meaning she gave me the wrong carrier (UPS instead of FedEx), forgot to send label, and gave the carrier the wrong pick-up time.
Days later: Technician Jesse finishes servicing and then disappears for three days. No response to emails, phone calls. Radio silence.
Today: Machine is still not working."
2639,5.0,2020-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Gives you everything you need without all the gimmiks and nonsense of some $1000+ machines. You can manage the amount of water, pressure, and temprature. Good to go.

Bonus! Conical burr grinder."
2640,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Actually, i already have brevile Nesspresso machine. But when it's come to brevile barista 879xl nothing to compare.
I'm in love with this machine. Much recommended"
2641,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine. My new hobby
2642,5.0,2019-06-17, Black Sesame,I love it. I can make coffee just how I want it. The compactor has a place to go. I can grind out my coffee while it steams the water pressure is great.
2643,2.0,2019-06-06, Black Sesame,I had it for 2 weeks and the grinder stopped working. I did the troubleshooting suggestions and it still didn't work. I guess I am glad it happened within the first 30 days because I was able to send it back.
2644,5.0,2018-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Still learning the little things, but havent had a complaint thus far."
2645,5.0,2021-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great barista machine that fits in the kitchen. Love it.
2646,5.0,2019-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Was easy to learn and clean. I have been using it daily for several months. Only issue I have had is that the steamer will not always kick on, however it is easily resolved by turning the knob to the hot water pour and back over to the steamer and it then works as expected."
2647,5.0,2019-07-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine! Great cup of jo and easy to use!
2648,5.0,2020-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We pitched in at the office to buy this machine and it has been outstanding. About 12 of us use it every day, and it has been more than up to the task. Very easy to use and clean. Highly recommended!"
2649,5.0,2022-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have had it for over 4 years now. Absolutely love it.
2650,5.0,2021-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Encantada
2651,5.0,2019-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have always wanted a unit like this for making crafty coffee. After considerable research, I decided on the Breville. It works well and has all the features of the large units that you find in units being used at high volume coffeehouses."
2652,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm in love with this machine. The only down side is that I am very picky about my java right now. The famous coffee shops just wont do it any longer. Took me a day or two to get my measurements right, and with the Breville Milk Frother... my Americanos and cappuccinos are superb."
2653,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine! I’ve had it a couple years now and it’s held up perfectly! This machine is one of my favorite things in the house !
2654,5.0,2019-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very easy to use. I save a ton not going to the big box coffee shops...and it tastes so much better. Definately recommend.
2655,5.0,2019-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this as a gift and it was definitely a good one.
2656,5.0,2020-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,I had my machine for 2days now and it squirted steam in my face and spit coffie on me and makes farting noises. like I do it when I make chocklet milk shakes best machine ever
2657,5.0,2022-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is a boss! Makes excellent espresso and lattes. I am very impressed. I have been a Starbucks fan for years and now I make them at home and they taste exactly the same. Worth every penny.
2658,5.0,2013-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"what a machine. if i had to make love a robot, this espresso tops the list. My first espresso maker, after doing extensive research, we found this all- in one machine to be super handy. grinds beans into fine mode and thermacoil water heater is great. easy clean and maintain.

Beans. Always be grinding. A++++"
2659,2.0,2020-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Product purchased December , 2017. It was easy to set up and makes a decent cup of coffee. It is not easy to grind fine enough to get a decent pressure on a double shot with the standard 2 cup filter basket. Another problem is that when the pressure indicator does show a brewing pressure greater than 11:00 o`clock on the gauge, water is forced out of the valve between the water tank and the base, leaving a puddle on the counter. It`s a nice product, but since I have not been able to find any solution to this problem, I cannot recommend this product."
2660,5.0,2021-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love the machine! It's sturdy, feature packed, and looks great. You need a little patience to experiment and get things dialed in to your liking. For a double shot, I have the grind setting on 6 and amount at 12:00. Once that's done the flavor is fantastic. I hope it lasts."
2661,4.0,2015-08-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's nice, but I can't always get the pressure right. At first, I thought it was defective. Generally, though, I'm satisfied with the purchase."
2662,5.0,2018-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve had this machine for 7 months and i use it multiple times daily. It is loud but it makes great coffee!
2663,5.0,2016-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"More time consuming that the jura, but the results are much better"
2664,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wow, breville really delivered with this machine. I had a lower end Breville prior and I can say this machine is phenominal for the price. The creama is so rich and
The shots are exactly what I like! Breville also has excellent customer service."
2665,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've always thought of this brand as being a premium high-end brand but the machine Stop producing expresso sufficient pressure after about 20 to 25 uses. It's also an incredibly complicated and difficult machine to use, now I understand why Nespresso and other Machines of that nature and it becomes so popular and widely used. You can buy them for 1/5 the price and they're incredibly simple compared to a full-blown expresso machine. The only two things I like about this machine as you can freshly grind the coffee, use organic coffee and you don't have to worry about leaching of aluminum from the Nespresso capsules"
2666,5.0,2020-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Cleaning it can be a pain but works great overall
2667,5.0,2018-08-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Built very well, they thought things through. The system will tell you when it it time to empty the spill tray for instance. I love it."
2668,5.0,2018-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What else do you need to know. Great coffee, great machine. Great combination of everything you need to make a quality coffee of your liking."
2669,5.0,2020-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use and produces a good cup of coffee.
2670,5.0,2020-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far this has been amazing. I got to Peet's almost every day so I needed a way to save some money by making coffee at home. I was hesitant at first but so far I've made some really good lattes.
2671,5.0,2020-02-18, Black Sesame,"Makes a great espresso,latte, cappuccino and more. Easy to use"
2672,5.0,2018-08-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I use this every day. It's user friendly, sturdy, reliable, and brews exceptional espresso."
2673,2.0,2019-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had this machine for 8 years and it was great, then it broke so I replaced it with this order.
After 6 weeks the foamer stopped working, so its been sent back. 8 years is what you expect not 6 weeks. I'm undecided if to re buy."
2674,5.0,2020-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine makes great espresso, is easy to use, and looks great!"
2675,5.0,2016-04-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine, it of course takes some time to get a great shot but after some practice it delivers a great shot. Provided you feed the machine with high quality fresh beans. only downside is i bought the black model an it sure is a fingerprint magnet, but overall a great buy."
2676,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine! Really easy to use and the coffee taste great!
2677,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine! Easy to do even for first time users like me. Now I make Espresso Lattes like Starbucks and am saving lots of money doing it myself. Best of all I can have there specialty Lattes whenever I want. LOVE, LOVE,LOVE this Espresso Machine!"
2678,5.0,2020-05-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great for a first time machine buyer. Had a friend who has owned a coffee shop for over 10 years give it a test run and got approval so as far as for home use I can't imagine much more I could want.
2679,5.0,2017-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome! Don’t know why we waited so long
2680,5.0,2019-05-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have had it about 2 months and love it. It's easy to use and clean.
2681,5.0,2018-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Just awesome! It is now slightly easier to get out of bed in the morning.
2682,4.0,2021-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent.
2683,5.0,2021-06-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Stop over spending on Americano's on the economy. Make your own, to your liking."

2688,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great and solid machine and excellent espresso.
2689,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve saved so much money on coffee since purchasing this. Easy to use and makes great espresso. Only complaint is that it’s a bit too noisy.
2690,5.0,2020-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine i make ice carmel machiatoo's with this and its fast and easy. Ive had it for over two months and this is a great machine easy to learn for first timers my drinks come out consistently the same. Taste alot better that starbucks and dunkin.
2691,5.0,2015-09-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Like this machine! You can adjust water temperature. Froths great!
2692,5.0,2021-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Espresso taste great. Does take a bit of fine tuning but can not lower score as I knew this to be true. With practice, can get the steamed milk smooth and with as much foam as desired."
2693,5.0,2018-03-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've used $2,000 machines that don't work as well. Comes with everything you need including built-in burr. Heats fast and clean up is a snap. Couldn't recommend more highly ... I'd even argue they aren't charging enough!!"
2694,5.0,2017-02-27, Black Sesame,"We purchased our Breville a few months ago. How did we ever lived without it?
It looks great. It's all contained in one device. It makes fantastic coffee. Our friends are all jealous.
It does take some fiddling with to get everything dialed in. Once you do, it's great!"
2695,5.0,2021-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Reliable and effective; please read the manual to maximize the benefits of this outstanding machine. You will love it!
2696,5.0,2021-01-25, Black Sesame,"Let me tell you something, dont waste money in other brands. Just save money for this little beast and forget about Starbucks or other coffe shop. I use it 4 times per day and work perfect. Dont think twice, buy it now!!!!!!"
2697,5.0,2022-05-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband LOVES this and he is picky! Worth the investment and the seller shipped the product quickly. This is not a beginners Espresso Machine - but once he taught me how to use it I make lattes better than Starbucks!
2698,1.0,2019-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,After countless hours and attempts to get the pressure to hit the expresso range the Breville does not work properly
2699,5.0,2020-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best present ever!
2700,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This thing works so well! I make two lattes every day. Love it!
2701,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After taking some time and doing some of my own research, via local upper class coffee houses, I've dialled in the most elevated home coffee experience ever. 'So happy with this machine. I ended up purchasing a 30 lb calibrated tamper to bring more consistency to the grind/dose/tamp ratio. I use Go Coffee Go dot com to get my appropriately 'roasted on' date espresso delivered."
2702,5.0,2019-01-15, Black Sesame,"As a fan of straight shots several times a day, I wanted quick, consistent shots whenever I got a quick break. This does it."
2703,5.0,2020-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is an amazing machine at a mid range price. We did tons of research prior to purchasing, makes great espresso and other drinks, love the grinder being consolidated with the machine."
2704,2.0,2020-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I loved this machine but after 3 weeks the grinder motor started failing. I called in for support and got very annoyed. I did the advanced cleaning 3 times, Im pretty sure there is a bad bearing on the motor drive shaft. It just doesnt have the power it should have. The folks on the phone just told me to clean it and would not give me the credit for knowing how things work and that I had already trouble-shot the problem. Now they want me to call them back and have them walk me through how to clean it. They just cant conceded that there may be a faulty motor or bad bearing in it. So frustrating."
2705,5.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,This thing is awesome. The built in grind does an amazing job. It makes shots super fast. Clean up is easy. I like my coffee more than going to the local coffee shops. Very happy with my purchase!
2706,5.0,2020-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love how easy is to use it !!! We use it everyday in my kitchen...
2707,5.0,2018-12-27, Black Sesame,"Makes a very good espresso, hot water (tea/chocolate) and easy to use."
2708,2.0,2022-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had problems with it ever since I got it. I kept thinking it was a learning curve, but it's not. The problems I'm having include water from somewhere inside the machine running into the tray. Sometimes I can see it running out underneath if I take the tray out. I keep having to empty the tray & wondered where it was coming from. Another problem I'm having is with the steamer - sometimes it works & often times it doesn't, even when the machine is on & fully ready. I don't know if this was a second hand machine or what, but I am very disappointed."
2709,5.0,2019-11-30, Black Sesame,Every day....
2710,2.0,2021-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine itself is great, brews very good espresso, but the grinder seems to have stopped working after a few weeks of consecutive use. each time I try to grind coffee, the machine gives out a very low and high-pitch sound, but no coffee comes out, as if the gears are slipping. I've performed the advanced cleaned on the burr multiple times, and after a couple of extractions, the problem reappears."
2711,5.0,2019-02-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Everyone is in Love with the coffee that this machine produces, it takes about the same time as a Kuerig to get a coffee in the morning and the taste is superb."
2712,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Was a great Xmas present works great and makes the best coffees
2713,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"At just over a year of making no more than two cups a day the machine began to have electrical issues. Sometimes it wouldn’t power on. Sometimes other buttons wouldn’t work. The auto feature on the grinder quit.
Thinking there was something loose to the control panel I took it apart today and discovered that the only way to remove it is either to unbend some fasteners (which are part of the meta front deco panel, that will likely break or remove all of the other internal guts of the thing. After jmying with it it’s working sometimes again so I left the top loose and it’s apparent that inside the machine gets a lot of steam. That steam accumulates and drips right into the backside of the controls. I may actually have better luck using it now that it’s open to let the moisture out instead of trapping it into the electronic components. It’s ridiculous"
2714,4.0,2020-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love the controls and ease of use.
2715,5.0,2020-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine if you like to get more out of you morning coffee.
2716,5.0,2018-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I use this espresso machine every day. It works very well. I was a barista for five years, and used professional machines. This machine is the best I could ask for in a home machine. It makes great espresso."
2717,5.0,2019-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine . I make 4-5 double shots a day. Also perfect for making a cup of tea. I have had this machine for a year and no troubles. It can be a little messy until you get the grind amount dialed in.
2718,3.0,2020-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had the machine since Christmas, it does make a good espresso. The only problem I've had is the filter basket sticks to the machine when I remove the portafilter leaving the basket in place. I have to manually pry it out. Annoying."
2719,5.0,2019-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, and easy to clean. This is our second espresso machine, and this one is so much quicker and easier to use last our last one. Makes great lattes! I’m so glad we bought it."
2720,1.0,2018-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this product in January 2017. I loved this coffee machine until two weeks ago when it quit grinding properly and doesn't develop any pressure whatsoever. It has been regularly cleaned and descaled. I've made two, sometimes 3 Americanos per day. Surely that should not have been over taxing for this machine. I could live with getting it repaired if only customer support from Breville would answer their phone, email.

Calling Breville gets a recording advising that they are experiencing a heavy volume of calls and offering to call back at a number designated by the caller. The call back never happens evens after numerous calls in and numbers left. Emailing a request is challenging. One needs the batch code to complete the customer support form. I fortunately had the required info, but thus far no response.

This is not a knock on Amazon. Amazon did everything right."
2721,5.0,2020-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Just buy the beans and make your own coffee! That’s what I like about it!
2722,5.0,2021-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love the ability to control pulling the perfect shot.
2723,5.0,2021-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works just like we had hoped it would. Makes perfect espresso.
2724,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine! I use it every day
2725,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have a dual boiler, which is great in every way. Got this for our guest house and the difference in machines is huge. It's overpriced for what it is. Returned."
2726,5.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am truly delighted. Very easy to use and clean. Makes excellent expressos.
2727,1.0,2020-02-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,two of them one from amazon the other from bed bath .. less than 6 month and an average of 5 to 6 cups pf espresso the first one goes out i call for warranty and they decline because its in my office and considered commercial two month later the second one don't work anymore pump problems that one i have used an average of 3 time a day at my shop for personal use and of course they want $275 plus shipping to fix because its over a year old .. nesspresso is 1/4 the price and still works like new after 8 month of use ..don't buy this. i am out $1200 and no machine and the only thing good about it is the grinder its convenient but i bought one for $30 and it works just as good.if you have one and it breaks make sure you say its for personal use only so they can't decline your warranty .
2728,3.0,2018-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It works as expected and pulls good espresso shots but there is an issue with the steam wand. It sometimes just stops in the middle of steaming for no apparent reason. Switching it off and on again gets it going again but, its a little concerning given that its so unreliable for a fairly expensive small appliance."
2729,5.0,2016-04-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome
2730,5.0,2018-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good product. I love that the grinder is included and that it has a milk frother. We use this espresso machine multiple times a day.
2731,3.0,2020-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,The steamer is not that good. Takes too long to heat up. But the grinder is great.
2732,5.0,2016-11-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine! Consistent, quality coffee and easy to use."
2733,4.0,2020-12-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,I LOVE IT ! JUST TAKES FOREVER TO MAKE DRINKS EXTRA HOT.. BUT GREAT OTHERWISE
2734,5.0,2019-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it. Easy to use, consistent shots. Highly recommend it!"
2735,5.0,2020-09-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,It just takes getting use to it. I was really bummed at first and overwhelmed with all the little steps you have to do to obtain a great cup of espresso. But then through a little trial and error you realize that its worth it. So just be patient with it and it will grow on you.
2736,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,we gave for a gift and they love it.
2737,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"im have a issue with expresso quality, its coming out watery"
2738,5.0,2018-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent cappuccino machine, definitely worth the money."
2739,2.0,2018-07-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was excited to finally order this expresso machine, as I have been saving up for 2 years or so, only to be disappointed with all the scratches on both front sides of the machine as well as dents on the bean compartment. I looks like it has been returned once before. Paying this much for a product and to see scratches on the stainless steel corners is very disappointing. I will not be ordering from the same seller."
2740,5.0,2022-06-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this easy to use espresso machine. I use it at least twice a day. It produces a consistently good latte!
2741,5.0,2018-12-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After assembling the product and reading the get started phamlet, it was much easier than predicted. Its kind of a science in some forms, however quite the machine to run. I'd rate this machine as one of the best on the market today!"
2742,5.0,2019-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing product. Received quickly and in perfect shape. Slight learning curve over more basic machines, but very worth the small effort to get through it."
2743,5.0,2020-08-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have had this about a year now. Amazing. Still running strong. Takes some getting used to if you’re new but just follow the directions and have fun with it
2744,5.0,2021-09-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Replaced my super automatic, much easier to maintain, takes some finesse to dial in the shots but worth it"
2745,5.0,2019-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s an amazing machine, we love it, perfect coffee maker."
2746,4.0,2019-05-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"i like this machine
i drink a coffee every morning and i really satisfied with this machine
you should get it
but you need to know this is a little expensive if you have extra money that your wife doesn't know, you should get it for your wife"
2747,1.0,2019-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It will not get up to espresso pressure and runs through too quickly. I’ve used many other machines and I know how to remedy this solution normally but this machine will not do it. I have grind size to 1 (smallest) I have very fresh beans I get from the roaster and I’ve tried about 8 types to see if that would make a difference but none have. I began packing it harder and harder trying to get the pressure up and that won’t do it either. If I use the double insulated porta filter it gets up to pressure but that filter makes the espresso foamy in a bad way. I believe it’s either the double shot porta filter, or the group head. But either way I haven’t been able to make a single cup as good as my old cheap machine because of this. Very disappointed"
2748,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Capable of pulling great shots. Easy to use and clean as advertised. I'm really enjoying it.
2749,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine, I use it everyday. It’s easy to work with and the taste is very consistent. Awesome machine!!"
2750,5.0,2021-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Got this for my daughter and son in law. He continues to tell us how much he loves this each time we are there. Well that’s put us in good standing.
2751,1.0,2019-08-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really really wanted to love this machine. It’s beautiful in every way. The ports filter feels so nice in your hand, great weight, balanced. However after 2 weeks of videos and new Arabica coffee and trying every burr setting/grind combo, and tamping , waiting for 20 minutes for the water to get hot….this machine only made sour coffee. Much to my chagrin, I had to send it back. I now love my new Delonghi- made great Espresso from the get go!"
2752,5.0,2020-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,My old espresso machine and burr coffee grinder both failed at about the same time after about 15 years. I purchased this to replace both units. So far I have been happy with it and love the coffee it makes.
2753,1.0,2019-05-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I used a Magnifica De Longhi for 8 years until...it really stopped working :(
So I ordered this Breville that had same day delivery: what a catch, I thought!
First surprise: frothing the milk...just does not happen. I have been frothing milk for 8 straight years with my Magnifica so I really know how to do it, but in this case I only got warm milk out of the frother.
Second surprise: the grinding mechanism is easy to get stuck and grinds indefinitely (cheap design)
Third surprise: after 5 coffees, I was not able to hook up the coffee powder holder any more: i spent 30 minutes trying, no luck
Not sure if this is really a lemon of coffee machine, or it got beaten up in the shipping, so I am clearly returning it.
What a disappointment..."
2754,2.0,2015-11-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We loved this machine it was great and made delicious expressos, etc. We also loved the wand and our ability to steam the milk. The problem is after about 11 months the steam wand stopped working and now (14 months post purchase) the entire machine has stopped working. The only thing that still works is the grinder."
2755,5.0,2020-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am new to coffee and espresso. This is great for me. It helps me easily make a latte to jump start my day. Very reliable. It has a great design and is built to last. I'm always surprised when I find a quality product.
2756,5.0,2018-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product. Takes a little bit to dial in and learn the settings if you are new to having a machine but am happy with purchase
2757,5.0,2019-11-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a fabulous latte. Seems to be stellar quality
2758,5.0,2021-10-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A very expensive gift for the espresso lovers. Easy to unpack, and instructions are clear on how to make the perfect espresso. Includes a grinder, steamer, and everything else you need to make the perfect cup of coffee. If you want to get a nice gift for someone this is the one gift to get"
2759,5.0,2017-07-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Beautifully machine, great coffee. Love the combined grinder to reduce mess!"
2760,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolutely wonderful machine. My first espresso machine, so it is novice friendly. Just make sure to do your research. By no means an automated machine where you pop in a pod... But great for someone who wants to learn about the craft of espresso and have excellent drinks at home. It is convenient to have the grinder attached as well. Highly recommended."
2761,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nice little machine. Not sure it's worth the price though.
2762,1.0,2017-09-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased my Breville in October. My son, a high-end coffee shop barista and coffee roaster, helped me set up the machine and pull my first few *excellent* espresso shots. I was really impressed. However, by January the grinder had suddenly stopped working. The pressure indicator has also failed.. I spent a weekend afternoon taking the grinder apart and cleaning it, to no avail. Tried calling customer/technical service but they’re only available during limited working hours (8-5 PST M-F). I can’t make this kind of call during the work day. I’ve resorted to having beans ground at a coffee shop and have been really frustrated that I’ve wasted money and time on this machine. And now the pump is making a very loud growling noise when I pull shots. What a disappointment!"
2763,1.0,2020-01-11, Black Sesame,I spent two to three full days and 4 types of coffee beans and adjusting settings and it still wouldn’t pull a shot correctly. I even had the help of two people who own one and they tried everything as well. This is not worth the money! I unfortunately had to send back.
2764,5.0,2020-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,This coffee machine is my best friend.
2765,5.0,2020-12-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Tricky to learn but once you do, totally worth it!"
2766,5.0,2020-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have used it for three months and have been very satisfied. I like the single wall and dual wall options. I'm very satisfied with this purchase , so far ."
2767,2.0,2021-04-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am a coffee person I had saeco machines for years and I though this would be a great buy, to me took me a while to get a half way coffee with out foam so I returned, looks good over my kitchen only"
2768,5.0,2018-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine and have been using it everyday. At first I was worried about the mess when it grinds the beans but after a couple of days it's definitely easier. Definitely found a new appreciation for coffee and would buy again!
2769,5.0,2016-10-17, Black Sesame,This is the best coffee machine you can buy.
2770,5.0,2015-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"i get beans from my local coffee shop (branch hill coffee co.). i cant tell you how much better than starbucks this thing is. (yeah i know, but theyre kinda the standard, right?). i deliberated over many reviews of various machimes before getting this, and i love it. a really high quality piece of kit."
2771,5.0,2018-10-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wife absolutely loves this. Will eventually pay for itself.
2772,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best cup of coffee I have made at home yet!
2773,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine! I am keeping track of my ROI but I spent $6.00 a day on Starbucks; while I miss my espresso experience and the interations with my baristas; I am gaining some mad skills which are making me a great in-home Barista. I have started making flavored lattes which are to die for :)
2774,5.0,2021-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine - makes a great espresso
2775,5.0,2018-11-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Mmmm, yes, quite. Very classy espresso maker. I found myself not being able to imbibe espresso with my pinky tucked around the glass but, rather, sticking out quite far on its own, indicating a sort of aristocratic nobility of its user."
2776,5.0,2018-09-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine, use it every day...very easy and a great cup of cappuccino"
2777,5.0,2019-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great purchase ..i'm a Baristah!!! Massachusetts accent included...lol
2778,5.0,2016-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,It makes excellent espresso & is easy to use.
2779,5.0,2020-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Was a hit. Not sure how difficult it is to use it but the bride had been a barista in a coffee house. They both love it
2780,1.0,2018-04-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just unboxed it and am following the instructions, but when going through the cleaning cycle, the steaming wand seems to not work appropriately. I constantly get water spray spurts every second or two spraying everywhere and making a mess. I let it run for a bit and cycled per the steps 1-3 for conditioning and still have the problem.

When I read other reviews, this is something that seems to occur after awhile, not new from the box...

Also, when I switch to hot water after steam being turned off for 10-15 seconds, it sprays steam out of the hot water and sputters, making a huge mess.

Trying to decide if I need to return the product. Not what you expect when paying $600.

If support is able to help me out, maybe I will reconsider my review."
2781,5.0,2020-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love love love it! Should have bought it sooner.
2782,5.0,2020-12-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Not because it keeps breaking - because we wanted one for the house, one for the office, and one for our #vanlife."
2783,2.0,2017-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"09/2018 update: it's failed. again. and they'll no longer repair or replace it out of warranty. The mechanism that measures volume of water uses is a delicate little thing that works when it wants to. They blame it on descaling, but have used filtered water exclusively, and cleaned it regularly.

previous review:

A compromise between manual and fully automatic. Makes great shots, easy to program and use.

The unit failed in a way that suggested it may need pretty regular descaling: 4 shots a day, and we cleaned every 2-3 weeks - will do more frequently in future. Breville warranty repair process was so painless, you really can't ask for more."
2784,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Build quality of the machine and all the accessories included
2785,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing product. Easy to use, makes great espresso. Highly recommend!"
2786,5.0,2020-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,I received this espresso machine as my birthday gift. I am very pleased with product. Easy to use and produce very good espresso.
2787,5.0,2019-06-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product. Its like having a barista at home.
2788,5.0,2019-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excelente muy practica y fácil de utilizar!!!
2789,5.0,2020-02-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great coffee, simple to use. Could have a better steaming wand."
2790,1.0,2019-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have the same probleme describe by ""1 cup of lungoon November 17, 2015"". After some months (we use it 5 or 6 times becauses we are old) the pressure gauge lost the power. We have 2 BES870XL because we have 2 houses but we have the problems with the last one after 6 months of use (we stay in each house 6 months per year). After eleven months the Pressure gauge don't work anymore and no more coffee go out of the machine. Breville don't want to repaire it under warranty because we bougth it from seller that is not authorized by Breville USA !!! (How you can know who is and who isn't ???).

After read the review of ""1 cup of lungoon November 17, 2015"" (Reviews of Amazon.com) I understand it's a common problem of the Breville BES870XL.

Forever, I will stay far away from Breville machines because they don't stand behind their stuff ""Made in China"". Bye bye Breville."
2791,4.0,2016-04-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great coffee. Works well on default settings. A bit difficult to solve problems when they arise, but customer service on phone was great!"
2792,5.0,2017-12-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Once dialed in, makes a very nice, very easy espresso"

2796,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought one for my aunt. She like it very much. she make coffee every day, and sometimes she take to her friend about this machine. with a cheap price."
2797,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Did a ton of research before buying one of these.. 2 years later and it’s still making great coffee.. just remember to change the filters out and do the cleaning when the light goes on.
2798,5.0,2020-07-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Use it every day, easy to use, great results."
2799,5.0,2019-07-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have always dreamed of having a espresso machine like this and it definitely lives up to my standards. Awesome product.
2800,5.0,2019-09-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine. Have had no problems with it. I have had it for a couple months now, and I've already gone through over 200 shots on the machine. I am making better lattes then my Local shops for a fraction of the cost.

I've made a video of my process on my machine from start to finish you can view it at

http://youtu.be/_tCyMY43Q9E"
2801,5.0,2017-05-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After watching a few videos online how to operate this machine, we really love it. Being a total novice I can now make really great espresso whenever I want. Love this product!"
2802,5.0,2020-07-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Needs PHD to operate - Learn to enjoy the process. Truly flavorful engineering!
2803,5.0,2018-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband loves this Christmas present! Perfect expresso’s and Latte’s
2804,1.0,2020-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Was disappointed to receive my machine and it came used and dirty . Hopefully able to exchange it for a brand new one since it was what I originally purchased .
2805,3.0,2018-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel," Didn’t get a chance to try the product out. Received the product, and it was in terrible shape. Paint worn completely off the plastic, milk and rust all over the steamer wand. Coffee grounds throughout the grinder. Looks like this thing had been used in a cafe for the last couple years."
2806,5.0,2018-10-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have used my machine for a year now and love it. Its already paid for itself from the money i saved by not picking up a $6 coffee on the way to work.
2807,5.0,2017-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband and I love it!!!!!!!
2808,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,
2809,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect machine for a cup of espresso whenever you want it!
2810,4.0,2020-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,to me double shot is the best and the machine is good so far
2811,3.0,2019-07-02, Black Sesame,it's amazing it's the perfect coffee machine.. but if you live in middle east you will need converter from 220 to 110 it has to be 2000 w that's the only issue i faced other than that the machine is perfect.
2812,3.0,2019-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Inconsistent pressure produce uneven flavor.
2813,3.0,2016-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Dosing dial to vary the amount of grounds does not work. The machine is extremely finicky with decaf beans but I finally found one brand of beans that works with relatively consistent success. Aside from that it's sturdy
2814,1.0,2020-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I loved this at first, although it's always been very noisy to run. However it stopped working completely by 6 months and became a $700 piece of junk. Do NOT recommend."
2815,5.0,2020-06-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Keep it clean and your will be happy forever!!
2816,1.0,2015-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had been wanting this espresso maker for nearly two years. Finally decided to buy it for myself as a gift and it stopped working after only two weeks. We had followed all of the instructions to a T and tried all troubleshooting recommendations. I'm honestly devastated. Additionally, the warranty that comes with the product requires you to pay over half the price of the product to even get it looked at."
2817,5.0,2019-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use. Now I make a better latte than anyone in town. Easy to use and clean. Just choose a good coffee bean, the machine does the rest."
2818,2.0,2020-04-20, Black Sesame,"The pressure gauge didn't work at all, so something was probably broken inside. I tried all the troubleshooting tips to try to get a nice shot of espresso with crema and nothing worked. Nobody answered at the Breville customer service number, so returning it."
2819,5.0,2019-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I used to own a coffee shop and have missed having a perfectly prepared latte ever since. Hands down this is the best machine on the market under $1000. I love it!
2820,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Refund
2821,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine works amazingly. The grind size and amount is crucial to get the pressure right but it works like a dream
2822,2.0,2019-12-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is really finicky. Every pour comes out differently, with the constant need to tinker with the settings. Definitely a bit surprised with all the positive reviews, as I feel that for this price point, the quality and consistency should be higher."
2823,5.0,2019-10-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! No complaints yet! Would buy again.
2824,5.0,2015-04-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolutely love this machine. We use it 3-5 times a day. It always produces perfect coffee. Adjustments for the highend beans we buy are very minimal. Clean up is easy, and needed, but worth it."
2825,4.0,2019-04-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very good machine. Compact, easy to clean. Portafilters do not work well, however, as they uncouple when clearing used coffee grinds."
2826,5.0,2020-09-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great product, ready to use out of the box, easy to use, you're only job is to find a great coffee beans, roasted properly!"
2827,5.0,2017-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is an excellent espresso machine. It is well built and, though small, makes great espresso and capacinno. I'd recommend it to anyone. Beats the hell out of that crummy Jura I had (that broke after 3 months)."
2828,5.0,2019-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best purchase we have ever made! We have saved so much money making our fancy coffee drinks at home. This machine is easy to use and pleasing to look at. Highly recommend!
2829,5.0,2019-09-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This coffee machine is absolutely great! I mostly use it to make lattes, and they came out better than Starbucks'. Love it!"
2830,4.0,2019-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso maker but a lot of water is wasted when trying to use the spout
2831,5.0,2020-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Same one I have longtime ago
2832,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Its a beautiful toy! Excellent!
2833,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love love love this machine I haven’t been to Starbucks in months and I am not missing it!!
2834,5.0,2020-12-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it super easy to use
2835,5.0,2016-09-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best thing I’ve bought myself in all my life!
2836,5.0,2020-06-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The best coffee machine I have used, even better than the expensive machines in the company offices."
2837,5.0,2019-07-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product we use it everyday!
2838,5.0,2015-08-12, Black Sesame,Good machine if you are a coffee snob
2839,5.0,2019-11-19, Black Sesame,This is our second unit we have one in both houses and we are thrilled with the quality and ease of use
2840,5.0,2019-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have two, great little machine best on the market nothing on the market this good for twice the price"
2841,5.0,2020-09-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Saves us a lot of money not having to go to Starbucks all the time.
2842,2.0,2020-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes a nice espresso and the electronic controls in it are top notch. However, you’ll be lucky to get 3 years (~1000 shots) of use before it breaks. The pump, solenoids and steam valve in it are low quality, leak and rapidly fail. If you can find the right parts and are a bit of a handyman it can be cheaply repaired. Pump and solenoids are readily available. The steam valve tends to clog after sometime, parts are not available and is a real challenge to repair."
2843,3.0,2020-10-06, Black Sesame,Worked great for about a year but started stalling as of recently. When trying to pull an espresso the machine lets out this screeching noise and the espresso produced is not up to par. Wish there was some sort of customer care available for this machine
2844,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely love this!! It has compley replaced my starbucks habit.
2845,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this espresso maker. My husband makes a latte every morning, and I'm able to have a great cup of coffee."
2846,4.0,2019-11-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It is easy to use, but it is bit nosy."
2847,5.0,2014-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"after much deliberation and online research ,we purchased this item. works well. customer service is prompt and representatives are polite and very helpful.Needs quality freshly roasted beans for good results.making espresso is a learning curve ."
2848,5.0,2016-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product
2849,5.0,2020-09-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wonderful espresso machine! Super easy to use and clean. I cannot express how happy we are with this product. Its a little noisy for an at home machine but nothing terrible. The machine did come with a small pitcher to steam milk and its perfect for the machine.
2850,5.0,2019-11-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Owning several coffee shops, I have this unit in my kitchen. Pulls shots better than most coffee businesses I've tried! Amazing machine. You still must have quality beans and good water though. It doesn't perform miracles"
2851,1.0,2019-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 It works perfect the first week. Now, after 2 month of use, the pressure stop working at all, the coffee that comes out (if any) is very light not expresso at all, cleaning was done as per book instructions, we make coffee only in the morning. Customer service is useless. Long story short a waste of money.
Funciono Perfecto la primera semana pero después de dos meses de uso el reloj de presión no funciona el café q sale (si sale) es bien aguado no expreso, le hicimos las limpiezas según el manual. El servicio al cliente no funciona. Una perdida de dinero"
2852,5.0,2019-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a great beverage. Looks beautiful too. Well worth the upgrade from the low end machines and quality of the espresso is as good as what you would get a local coffee shop.
2853,5.0,2019-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Make nice coffee and easy to adjust and control for even beginners. This little machine will cheer you up every morning.
2854,4.0,2017-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Product failed since I connected it to 220 voltage. Unfortunatly, no services at Saudi Arabia. I contacted Breville at Twitter with no respnse.!!"
2855,1.0,2016-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This USED TO be a stellar five-star review. Got this machine in October of 2019 for my 50th. Loved it!

Unfortunately 11 months into it (making coffee twice a day) the grinder stopped working properly. It hardly grinds thin enough for espressos and when it does it doesn’t expel the coffee grounds.

I only use fresh, light roast coffee (never oily). I consistently clean the machine and follow all instructions. I’m not new to espresso machines either and have had many.

The biggest problem is not the grinder however, it is THE HORRIFIC EMBARRASSMENT OF A CUSTOMER SERVICE AT BREVILLE! I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SO MUCH FRUSTRATION IN MY LIFE!

My case is still open and I’m trying my best not to throw this thing in the river. So upset."
2856,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,The Breville Barista Express was very easy to start using the first day I received it. The owner's manual and helpful website tips have help me to brew a great cup of espresso. The bean grinder is convienant and works well. I am happy with a full wallet due to the savings of brewing expresso at home and meeting the same quality of a major coffee store.
2857,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"thank you very much, I really like this product, it has good quality and price, I enjoy when I use it, but I use it every day"
2858,5.0,2016-02-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pretty easy to use, makes amazing drinks!"
2859,5.0,2021-07-12, Black Sesame,No more starbucks.....again!
2860,4.0,2019-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Impressive looks, relatively easy to use and makes good lattes, cappuccinos etc.
However I still am not able to get the PRESSURE up where I would like to have it with this machine.
I have owned many espresso machines with the prior one being a Breville..."
2861,5.0,2020-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso and lattes. Easy to use.
2862,2.0,2019-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Never worked right We sent it back three times and the last time it came back the same as it was before I would never buy a product like this again the customer service is good they just don’t fix it
2863,5.0,2020-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,In love. So easy to use even for a novice as long as you follow instructions. Espresso better than in a coffeehouse. Totally worth the money.
2864,4.0,2020-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is BEAUTIFUL.....wish I had ordered it....but I am a tea drinker. If you drink coffee you should get this
2865,5.0,2018-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome! Looks nice but more importantly works great!
2866,5.0,2019-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Took practice to get it right, but we love it. Easy to operate, adjust and clean. Designed well for use and beauty."
2867,1.0,2017-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,The bottom of the machine was covered in coffee grounds and there are scratches and bumps all over the machine. I paid 700 dollars for a machine that is supposed to be new but is instead given a damaged product that wasn't even cleaned.
2868,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Everything is great, but the only reason I rate 4 stars is the micro-bubble maker part doesn't work well as I expected so that I use another machine for the bubble."
2869,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a wonderful machine, improved from the previous version. It is much quieter than the previous model and the larger bean hopper is a plus. Perfect espresso made every time; quality of pull is better than a Starbucks Doppio. We highly recommend this unit for its quality, value and ease of use."
2870,5.0,2019-11-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've had mine for 3.5 years now and it's still going strong!
2871,5.0,2018-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine. Makes a great espresso, looks nice, and cleans up easily. I didn't know if I wanted the built in grinder since it's one more thing that could fail, but really useful to have it right there and it does a nice job."
2872,5.0,2019-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,That machine makes a excellent coffee. I have bought this machine half year ago. Initially I had problems to build up water pressure and i was one second from sending it back. Next morning i switched it back on and pressure was there. I can only assume that some air still was in the hydraulic system. Since then problem free and superb coffee.
2873,5.0,2018-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Would recommend
2874,5.0,2016-04-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great for a home machine—but try to get it on sale. It would be nice if the steam wand was more powerful.
2875,5.0,2020-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it overall..grinder is more of a hassle
2876,5.0,2019-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Pretty much not electronic savy but figured it out
2877,3.0,2020-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,I loved this machine when I first got it! It worked perfect however after about 8 months of use by just one person it seems like it is starting to lose pressure to extract espresso and I am very disappointed. I would expect it to last longer for the price I paid I had a Mr. coffee before this one and it was 1/4 of the price and lasted years.
2878,5.0,2019-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this! Very nice
2879,5.0,2016-04-20, Black Sesame,I really don't leave a review but this one is totally awesome! I've had a couple of espresso machines of different brands before and this Brevile espresso machine is best investment ever!! Believe you won't disappoint about it!!
2880,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee maker. Easy to use
2881,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"steamer is a bit slow, and the automatic coffee grinder tends to grind way too much which is a complete waste.

Overall though it makes great coffee with a bit of practice."
2882,5.0,2021-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"its amazing coffee machine , I'm so in love with it , soo professional , I feel like I'm a professional Barista when I use it, advice all to have it"
2883,2.0,2017-07-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"OK, so I gave up the super-automatics like Gaggias because I got tired repairing them. Maybe the Breville not-so-automatic machine would be a little more work to make a cup, but not as much worry about what would break next.

So, my hopes are dashed. Machine will only draw pours on the default setting. The programmable amount of pour will not work. To get the amount of coffee I want in my espresso cup, I now have to turn it on and off manually."
2884,1.0,2020-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Put it all together. Check on it in an hour and is leaking water all over my kitchen floor and cabinets. I expected something better for close to a grand. Instead I feel like I got some Chinese crap. Not impressed...
2885,5.0,2018-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,A luxury worth the price
2886,5.0,2020-07-22, Black Sesame,Thank you!!! This machine has helped me cut my cord with my supplier and I love being able to make my favorite drink in the convenience of my home.
2887,1.0,2020-10-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had mine for 14 months and it worked ok for 4 of those months, then it stopped working. It was like it no longer had any pressure. This is a cheap machine and for the cost of $550 I highly recommend spending a little more to get a high quality machine from an online distributor! Breville is a nightmare to try to return anything, believe me, it's not worth the hassle. If I had known in hindsight what I know now, I NEVER would have purchased this machine. I was swayed by the reviews. I think most people are ok with a mediocre machine because they've never been a barista and know high quality to set the bar like I have. Yes, you definitely want good beans to start with and grind only what you need each day, but the Breville BES870XL isn't going to be your machine, trust me."
2888,1.0,2017-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Horrible company support. Expect to have to replace every year. Even with purchasing extra warranty through Amazon, you have to purchase and repair the machine yourself. This is the second one I have purchased and it stops working at 14 months. Never again. It’s a worthless piece of machinery."
2889,5.0,2020-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Exactly what I wanted. Purchased some organic coffee beans and stevia from Amazon as well. Bye bye Starbucks. I am keeping my money.
2890,5.0,2019-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Incredible machine! Had Keurig for years and wish we bought this sooner. No more K Cups!
Great product and reliable shipping."

2897,5.0,2020-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This makes my morning, every morning. It is simple to use and has many functions. Having fresh grounds for my espresso is a game-changer!"
2898,5.0,2018-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is an awesome machine. It's easy to use, easy to clean and with the delicious Mason Joe Coffee beans, roasted fresh twice a week and delivered to your door, the product is the absolute best. I'll never go to *bucks again! 5 Stars."
2899,5.0,2019-10-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,I like it as it is!
2900,1.0,2017-05-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,It stopped making espresso shortly after I bought it
2901,5.0,2019-07-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best investment we've made in a long time... has saved us thousands in a year and has held up nice.. just clean when the clean light comes on!
2902,3.0,2020-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"with the bean hopper connected on top, it won't fit under your normal cabinet height. Bummer. Makes good expresso but the crema is pretty sad. Splurge for the Jura.... all automatic and delicious."
2903,5.0,2016-11-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! I can't go back to drip coffee now!
2904,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really was expecting a flawless experience, but the steam wand is flaky at best. It will often either stop or start sputtering AFTER the machine says it's good to go and it's in your milk. Also, the grinding cradle for the portafilter spills an excessive amount of grounds every time."
2905,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I use it every morning. Well made.
2906,5.0,2021-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Well made and works like a champ.
2907,5.0,2020-02-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine. Use it every morning.
2908,5.0,2019-08-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband makes us coffee in this almost everyday. He loves using it! I love the yummy coffee. Would recommend.
2909,5.0,2016-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine for the price. Pays for itself.
2910,3.0,2020-08-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Machine made great espresso but that's about it. You can't make any others types of coffee. Machine was well built. Sent it back and bought a machine that autatically mahes several types of coffee.
2911,2.0,2019-08-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine did not solve my problems, it actually complicated them:) No one wants to stay 30 min in the morning to make a cup of good coffee. I was not able to make a good coffee because of so many things to keep in mind, like how fine is the coffee, the eight temperature, pressure, etc. Too complicated and not easy to clean at all. I went back to my old and simple espresso machine."
2912,5.0,2018-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great espresso machine. I love making good quality espresso in the morning. Also great for espresso based drinks. You need to adjust the grind when switching brands of beans, otherwise the espresso with taste weak or bitter."
2913,2.0,2020-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have bought the given machine without checking the voltage and i am living in middle east with 220 v supply. Could you please recommend the converter brand to be used of such an application.

In the market many brands that can convert but none with the specific watts and amps needed which is 2000watts, 15A

Just recommend or give me a link of any product which can work fine from amazon"
2914,3.0,2018-03-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Disappointed with the foaming function. Cannot produce the thick foam that I like for cappuccinos, steams only. On plus side, make excellent espresso. But for the price, I expect it to do everything."
2915,5.0,2019-02-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a great product!
2916,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,My hubby loves his espresso machine. I could not thankful enough for this beautiful piece. We hardly go somewhere for a good coffee since we had it. Thank you breville!
2917,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is very well built and easy to use. Good size for the home kitchen. Highly recommend.
2918,5.0,2017-09-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Estoy 100 % satisfecho con el producto, funciona como una máquina profesional por una fracción de su precio"
2919,5.0,2015-09-19, Black Sesame,Great Product. Got it yesterday first 5 espresso's with milk have all been perfect. Machine is heavy and feels good quality. I hope I get 5 years out of this.
2920,1.0,2020-04-27, Black Sesame,"I bought one of these for Christmas and then one for may parents in April. I noticed the grinder was really slow on the new one. Had to spend an hour with Breville and then Amazon on the phone to return the stupid thing. Vacuuming out beans and wasting tons of time later, yes it's broken, I own one and know how it should grind. No compensation from either company. Don't waste your time, get a different espresso maker. Breville has obviously cut corners on their grinder."
2921,4.0,2020-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Grinder works great
easy to set up
Straight forward if you want to use the preset function
I do wish it was easier to extend the pull time. I'm sure if I read the instructions I could find out how!
Looks beautiful!"
2922,5.0,2017-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wow works great use it every day!
2923,5.0,2018-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best investment I have ever made! I use this EVERY SINGLE MORNING! Worth every single penny!
2924,1.0,2019-08-03, Black Sesame,"So, I bought my first Breville BES870BSXL for my office towards the end of 2018 and I was very new to coffee. The machine seemed okay, but I had little to no experience making espresso. Then in 2019 I purchased a second machine for my house. I quickly realized that my first machine was defective after I starting making espresso with the new machinee. The difference was night and day. I tried to get the first machine replaced, but the seller refused as it had been 'too long'. So I went directly to Breville AND WHAT A NIGHTMARE. They have basically ignored me and there customer service is non-existent.

So, if you don't get a defective unit, you are probably good, but if you actually need support from Breville, good luck."
2925,5.0,2013-06-24, Black Sesame,Amazing! Changed our mornings!!
2926,5.0,2019-11-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,makes a very good latte
2927,5.0,2019-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine. A little complicated but a learning curve. Instructions could be a little more detailed, but great videos online to help."
2928,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great when the stars align but half the time just frustrating. Who needs aggravation in the morning??
The problem is always yours, the beans aren't fresh, the grind is too fine or too coarse, too much grind, too little grind, every different blend tried starts the whole process over again. Just move on....."
2929,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Avoid this machine. If you are looking to get a machine in this price range you will do better getting a Rancilio Silvia or a Gaggia Classic Pro. I have had Breville’s Barista Express for over 16 months now, and I can say that it is a really inconsistent machine. The built in grinder is terrible, as the coarseness doesn’t vary much, even if you dial it in properly. Breville will not service my machine and they ignored my emails. As if the machine had no warranty."
2930,5.0,2020-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine, surpassed my expectations. Great coffee, fun to use."
2931,5.0,2017-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really good coffee machine, couldn't be happier"
2932,5.0,2016-10-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Compact and well built barista! Quality product.
2933,5.0,2020-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have purchased 3 machines, that should say enough. Great for a shower gift or a house warming gift."
2934,5.0,2020-04-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Beautiful machine. Makes a great espresso every time. Easy to use if you’re new at espresso machines.
2935,1.0,2016-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Upon opening this, you can’t help but feel so excited. It has some of the best reviews everywhere for a home use espresso machine. It has a grinder included which is a huge deal because a lot of espresso machines that are over $1000 don’t even have that. This would be the perfect machine if that grinder actually worked. I am incredibly sad that it doesn’t because I wanted this to be the one I don’t want to have to spend $1500 on a home use espresso machine but it looks like I’m gonna have to. The grinder worked the first two times and then it started slowing down and missing after that. Now it takes MULTIPLE attempts to get one shot of ground coffee beans. Such a waste and disappointment."
2936,5.0,2017-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This thing is right on for the home barista. Good results at a decent price. Really am happy with this purchase. You could go with a cheaper machine, but may not be as happy with the result as with this machine."
2937,5.0,2019-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have had 2 previous espresso machines, thought they were good but didn't get the full coffee flavor, but this one extracts all the flavor it is great lot's of pressure on the steam,"
2938,5.0,2020-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,best café con leche I ever had
2939,1.0,2019-06-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was so excited to recieve this espresso machine and it worked great for the first month. First the pressure gage stopped working, then it started pouring random amounts although I was using the same button, and finally the machine started leaking from the bottom after each brew. 10 days after the return policy canceled.
So so very disappointed"
2940,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,My wife loves making mocha's everyday. This little guy can turn out some great espresso for her morning ritual.
2941,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"The only affordable kitchen espresso bar I have ever seen. It sometimes needs a bit of a flush to get shots back to the right pull, but I could say the same of any large, commercial grade espresso bar. If this somehow incorporated the La Marzocco auto tamper it would be perfect."
2942,5.0,2019-06-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine I use it with Colombian coffee
2943,5.0,2019-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this thing.
2944,5.0,2018-03-28, Black Sesame,The machine makes delicious expresso. I love the Americanos that I make with my machine at home.
2945,2.0,2019-05-06, Black Sesame,"This has been sitting on my counter for months, unused. I spent hours when I first got it, trying to get a decent shot. I may try again someday, but for now, it just sits on the counter. I probably wasted my money."
2946,5.0,2020-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Long story short highly recommended amazing machine as described better than with you will expect I am more than satisfied thank you.
2947,1.0,2019-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I paid $603 for a new expresso machine and received a used one. Packing damaged, coffee grinds everywhere and machine not cleaned. It did smell good (like fresh coffee), but definitely disappointing!!!!"
2948,5.0,2020-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! We bought this to replace an older Breville model that broke. We used that one every day for 9.5 years. Looking forward to many years of tasty espresso with this one.
2949,2.0,2020-08-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Highly disappointed. Oh, I was over the moon at first. Makes a wonderful cup of coffee. Unfortunately, after only a month, the steam wand does not work properly any more. It will steam my milk only to about 100-120, not the recommended 140-160 (it did fine until a few days ago). Now, not only can I not get my milk to the proper temperature, I can no longer froth. For nearly $600 I would expect (reasonably, I believe) that the machine would function properly for several YEARS, not a mere month. I have written to the seller. We shall see if I get a satisfactory response (replacement). If not, I will be returning it and buying elsewhere."
2950,1.0,2018-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have only had this machine for 4 months and the black coating is coming off in multiple places all over the machine. Breville’s warranty was of no help as they consider this cosmetic damage that’s not covered.
2951,5.0,2014-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,very pleased - highly recomend
2952,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had espresso machines most of my adult life and like to think I know what I’m doing. This one absolutely will not build enough pressure to extract. It's extremely noisy, the gage simply will not go any higher than the lowest few lines, which is the initial prime. It’s probably best described as making a ""Meh"" effort while making a whole lot of racquet. I've used different beans from half a dozen sources ground at every imaginable grind size and amount, both single and double shots. There's obviously something wrong here but I've not gotten any response to my request for help from Breville as the manual says to do. I’ve reached out to the seller now and will update this one way or another."
2953,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best purchase I’ve made in a while. Lives up to the hype, now I’m over caffeinated."
2954,5.0,2015-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Impressive quality. Great coffee. My wife loved it as a bday gift.
2955,5.0,2019-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing and quality is outstanding
2956,1.0,2019-06-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Out of the box with the factory settings my espresso was only lukewarm. Followed the instructions in their manual to reprogram but after several attempts to increase water temperature it still wasn't reaching the proper temperature to make a decent tasting espresso, another issue was the amount of water released into reservoir which seemed excessive for two cups a day, I would need to empty every three days. Must have been a defective machine so I have returned for a refund."
2957,1.0,2018-06-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve found out that Part number SP0020444 solenoid valve assembly for my Breville espresso machine needs to be replaced. I’ve spent hours on the phone trying to call their customer service but they’ve never picked up and never returned my calls. Moreover, Ive found that it’s impossible to buy any parts as they don’t produce them any longer. My machine is in the garage now. Not working...Hello, is there anybody? Maybe it’s better to stop selling your machines until you bother yourself on how you are going to replace the parts??"
2958,5.0,2018-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best coffee espresso machine i every purchase. it is a 10 star machine lot of thought went in to the programing of this machine very user freinedly
2959,5.0,2020-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,could not love this expresso machine any more than we do! We have bought it as a wedding gift for friends... thats how much we love it!
2960,5.0,2020-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worth every penny
2961,4.0,2020-02-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I don't know if you can call $600 entry level, but I think that's about a minimum for a real espresso maker. Nice machine, good value."
2962,5.0,2020-05-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far so good!
2963,3.0,2020-07-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,It is huge. It takes up almost the entire counter and needs a lot of cleaning and maintenance care.
2964,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Pulls a perfect shot after a few tweaks. Relatively easy to clean/maintain. Have had mine for three months and have only gotten better and better shots. Very happy with it!!
2965,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wonderful machine when it all works. The grinder is broken - sounds like a striped gear 🤷. At least Breville support wasn't too much of a hassle but it's literally 40 days old. Would not recommend or buy any Breville products again. I regret not spending a bit more for a more reliable esspresso machine.
2966,4.0,2020-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it. Still learning how to use it to get the max out of it.
2967,3.0,2020-04-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,We used this machine about twice per day. Great espresso but after 14 months we now have issues. Not getting water through the group head. Hopefully a quick fix but we will see.
2968,2.0,2019-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm sad to report that we are having quality issues with Breville. Our first Barista Express lasted three years, and the water pump died, so we bought another in December 2016. By April 2017, the grinder stopped working (not clogged, a dead switch) so we went through the long process of waiting for Breville to ship us a box so we could return it for warranty repair. We finally got it back May 26, and by June 1 it was dead again. We are still dealing with this with Breville and won't buy another combined unit. :("
2969,5.0,2019-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This replaced a 20-year-old machine...and made us wish we'd bought it years earlier. Easy to use, and makes a brilliant espresso or latte.
Love this one!"
2970,5.0,2016-09-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've had less expensive espresso machines for about 20 years and I finally decided to splurge. I LOVE it!
2971,5.0,2017-07-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Looks great , it’s made of a superb quality and I love espresso. I recommend this machine l."
2972,5.0,2019-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,I made my coffee every day
2973,5.0,2018-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I like it 😊
2974,4.0,2017-09-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,what I expected
2975,5.0,2020-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best one I’ve ever owned
2976,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,It is amazing coffee maker
2977,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best all around.
2978,5.0,2015-11-02, Black Sesame,This baby is amazing. Use it once or twice a day for me and the misses and never had a problem in 6 months. Delicious espresso coffee drinks on demand from home. How nice to wake up on Saturday and not debate if driving to a cafe is worth leaving home.
2979,2.0,2022-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,I really liked this machine! It was easy to use and made a great latte! My issue is that it only lasted 1 year and 3 months! I kept it clean so I don't understand why this happened!
2980,5.0,2017-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product . Reliable performance . Very good workmanship . Works as advertised . Very reasonably priced compared to similar products . Very happy with the purchase . So happy I purchased a second one for a second home .
2981,5.0,2020-01-12, Black Sesame,After doing loads of research I finally settled on this machine. I’m glad I did. It consistently pulls delicious shots and the built in grinder and tamper are awesome.
2982,5.0,2018-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Had previous model that lasted for many years. Old grinder did not feed beans evenly. this one does so there is no incidence of the blades not having any beans to grind.
2983,4.0,2018-04-09, Black Sesame,"We like this very much, if you buy it get a knock box and pad.
It does not come with them and they are needed"
2984,2.0,2018-11-28, Black Sesame,"I bought the unit aug 16 2019. Of every thing I have read or the vids I’ve watched, The temp for a good espresso is
In the area of 200 degrees. I’m lucky the I can get 140 degrees. Pressure is all over the place. I see that DeLongi has
a new model that’s similar to this one. I have bought several breville machines, but this is the last one."
2985,1.0,2020-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The product broke after 1.5 years (loud noises, no water during espresso shots). This was frustrating after doing all regular maintenance , but I was not concerned given I intentionally purchased the Smart Guard Protection extended warranty through Amazon at the time of initial purchase. Unfortunately they made every step of this process an absolute nightmare, and 9 months later I sit here still without my machine even returned to me from the warranty company! With absolutely no end in sight, I have no choice but to take my complaint to this review board. I have called both the warranty company and the technician more than 10 times each and am routinely lied to by both parties. I have given up with the 'Smart Guard' warranty protection and will certainly never buy the machine or the warranty protection again!"
2986,5.0,2019-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best espresso machine for the price
2987,5.0,2021-03-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great all in one machine, some times hard to pull consist shots but it's probably the crappy beans I have or inexperience."
2988,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,great machine so far.
2989,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,this thing is awesome. the only problem I'm having with it is that it works too good and I'm drinking way too many mochas.
2990,5.0,2019-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine, used in my office by two people every day. Rugged and makes fabulous espresso and americano's. Make sure not to neglect maintenance."
2991,5.0,2017-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worth every penny!
2992,1.0,2020-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,We received a used machine. Clearly seen in pictures. A replacement couldn’t be sent and now have to wait 7 days to receive refund.
2993,5.0,2019-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,It makes a very good espresso cafe
2994,5.0,2016-05-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very nice product works like a professional unit cleans very easily
2995,5.0,2020-09-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product and purchase!
2996,5.0,2018-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This has been a great treat for the past 11 months, ever since we got it. Truly delicious, easy to make espresso. Every cup feels like a special treat."
2997,5.0,2018-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,It is an awesome machine
2998,5.0,2020-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,I ❤💚💜💙💛 this espresso machine!
2999,5.0,2019-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use. Great machine. Looks nice and doesn’t take up too much room.
3000,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,works right out of the box
3001,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I use it every day. When I'm in a hurry, I make an americanos. I never knew an americano could be as smooth as a latte!"
3002,5.0,2019-07-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Came very quickly in perfect condition! Does make yummy espresso. Really nice unit with all the extras needed to get going :)
3003,4.0,2021-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good machine. The pressure gauge is kind of hard to get perfect though. Pack it tight
3004,5.0,2014-01-18, Black Sesame,We love this! Replaces expensive lattes and also produces great americano coffees. Extremely happy with this machine!
3005,5.0,2019-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm a first-time coffee maker, the machine is easy and quick. Awesome result. no more trip to starbucks...."
3006,1.0,2020-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Broken out of the box. The gauge didn’t work (i.e., the needle never moved at all). I tried calling Breville support but they have the most useless hours (basically work hours only on weekdays—who’s home and able to troubleshoot a machine then?). Amazon tech support was really responsive and helpful, but unfortunately unable to do anything more than contact the manufacturer on my behalf. It was impossible to figure out the right grind and tamping without the pressure gauge. And, to top it all off, the machine leaked water like crazy onto my countertop. I returned it to amazon. I finally gave up on trying and just used my old Nespresso machine, which tasted better at that point anyway."
3007,5.0,2021-09-14, Black Sesame,This machine rocks!! Hard to go and buy coffee/lattes anywhere else that tastes as good.
3008,5.0,2019-04-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have only had this a few days, replaced our old Starbucks Barista machine with this one and so far LOVE it, the espresso is so much richer! Shipping was really fast too, thank you!"
3009,5.0,2020-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,A little overwhelming but just watch the video.
3010,5.0,2020-07-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've been using this machine daily for over a year and love it! Works well and makes great latte! I can use hot water for tea so I don't need a tea kettle any more. Highly recommend!!!
3011,5.0,2018-11-21, Black Sesame,Love this machine
3012,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,My wife loves it.
3013,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It takes some hands on w this machine and I love that you have to pay attention and tinker.

Once dialed in you can get a perfect shot.
Swivel steam arm is great and useful.
Steams perfect, great pump pressure.

Lovely design.
Perfect bit of kit.
Quality don't hesitate!"
3014,2.0,2020-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Grind amount was inadequate and espresso pulls often did not happen.
Perhaps, I just got a defective machine but something that Breville should have checked?"
3015,1.0,2013-10-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE: I ended up ordering another one and it had the same issues from the first day. Tried to get the item replaced and for the first time an amazon customer rep was extremely UNHELPFUL. I will be returning and never buying again.

I am so disappointed at this. I love it for as long as it lasted!

My espresso stopped working and I have wasted so much coffee trying to even get it to work again. Sadly I never purchased warranty so i’m screwed!

BEYOND DISAPPOINTED— I should have paid attention to the reviews."
3016,2.0,2020-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Overall it is a great machine with a steep learning curve. I’m not happy with the lack of customer service from Breville. You can sit on hold with customer service...only to give up and leave a message for a call back...Breville never returns phone calls. I don’t think I would ever buy another Breville product with their poor customer service.
3017,5.0,2017-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The envy of my coffee friends. This machine is fantastic. Easy to use, easy to set up, easy to clean, and makes a magnificent and consistent drink every time. This is the machine you're looking for."
3018,5.0,2018-11-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best purchase ever
3019,2.0,2020-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The pressure needle worked for a dozen cups then stopped, It moved 1/4 inch after that and that's all. I tried moving the bean quantity to less and less as there was so much waste but it made no difference, at the far (-) end of the scale, it pushed as many beans as (+) before It just didn't work, nor did the quantity of beans per cup control. Everything was at maximum.

Two Stars because the frother worked very well, thick froth for cappuccinos, fix the controls and we may be back.

I really wanted this to work, we love the Breville Toaster Oven, you can actually broil in it... we had hopes this would work equally well but it just doesn't."
3020,5.0,2019-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fantastic product! Love this machine!
3021,5.0,2018-12-05, Black Sesame,"Easy to set up, a quick review of the instructions and you're ready to go!"
3022,5.0,2019-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve owned for about a month now and have enjoyed trying different coffees and experimenting with different methods.
3023,5.0,2015-03-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,I use this twice a day at least. I love it. My husband hasn't drunk coffee in years but he has started again because the freshly ground beans make the kitchen smell like his grandmother's kitchen in Haiti.
3024,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love the machine very much and were happy with it until it stopped working only a few months in.
This is where the trouble started, the customer support is hard to reach on the phone. Submitting a ticked on the website tool for more than 45 minutes. We sent the machine in a get in back in less than 14 days. We were so happy to get the machine back, however, it comes back with the same problem. They did nothing to fix the machine."
3025,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, easy to clean!"
3026,5.0,2020-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,So much better than a coffee maker. I brought it to country thunder and everybody a fancy coffee when they woke up lol
3027,5.0,2019-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the best purchase I have ever made. It is dependable, easy to clean, and makes delicious espresso!!!!"
3028,1.0,2018-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Received our machine yesterday and it doesn’t work. Have tried to contact the seller and have had no response. It was advertised as brand new but appears to have been used when we received it as there were coffee grinds all throughout the machine, scratches on it and it doesn’t work at all. This seller is a crook. Buyer beware, zero stars!!!!"
3029,5.0,2020-04-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best coffe
3030,5.0,2020-02-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Awesome consistent espresso. Easy to use. Great value. Replaces my ""Gaggia Espresso-Color"" machine, which died on me. I was happy with that machine, which I had for years, but this one is even better."
3031,5.0,2019-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso machine. My wife and I have double shot espresso every morning.
3032,5.0,2017-07-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great well built machine
3033,5.0,2020-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing best choice we’ve made in a while to purchase
3034,5.0,2017-07-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this thing
3035,5.0,2019-08-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great product, great coffee"
3036,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I like my Latte's and this makes them great...
3037,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very flexible, fairly easy to use. Would recommend for your average person for making espresso drinks"
3038,2.0,2019-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"the machine started to work normally only after preventive cleaning. before that, she did not heat the water, the thermostat needle did not move at all"
3039,1.0,2016-07-14, Black Sesame,"I got this thing as a Christmas gift to myself, and sadly it broke within 6 days of use. Making about 6 shots everyday during the time it worked, very easy to use."
3040,5.0,2019-06-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Saves so much money. A great latte at home
3041,5.0,2017-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works great and has a lot of options to tweak the outcome. Love it.
3042,5.0,2020-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee and easy to use with directions. Hoping to save money by making excellent coffee at home.
3043,4.0,2018-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, easy to clean. Seems to give a good pressure. Grinder needs more settings/grades."
3044,5.0,2019-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,La recomiendo 100%
3045,5.0,2020-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,An awesome product!!
3046,2.0,2022-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s not worth the price. It looks great. It grinds well. But it doesn’t live up to the price. The steaming system is not professional grade. The extraction adjustments need to be made constantly, resulting in a lot of wasted beans and espresso down the drain. When it makes a good cup, it’s excellent, but it’s very inconsistent. You can get one just as good for half the price, I am certain."
3047,5.0,2018-04-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Awesome machine for home use. Really allows someone who knows how to use a professional machine in a high end coffee shop to customize the grind, fill, tamp, and extraction for a great cup of coffee.

Well thought out and engineered machine allows for very easy cleaning and maintenance."
3048,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,This machine makes a great espresso. I’m very happy with this purchase! Highly recommended!!!
3049,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to make great coffee
3050,5.0,2019-12-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works like a charm
3051,5.0,2017-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works great.
3052,5.0,2019-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,We’ve had this espresso machine for a while now and I couldn’t be more delighted with it.
3053,5.0,2019-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes a great espresso. The bean grinder works great and the milk frother doesn’t take long to foam the milk. Much more economical then getting daily espressos.
3054,5.0,2020-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine works perfect
3055,5.0,2017-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Awsome espresso!
My machine is amazing and the customer service is as well. After owning my machine for several years I had an issue come up. Breville was fast and exceeded my expectations. A great investment for coffee lovers!!!"
3056,5.0,2018-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love how easy it is to adjust settings to make the perfect shot.
3057,3.0,2015-04-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had machine for one year and two weeks when it broke. Costs more to fix than to get a new machine. Up until then, fairly good machine - a little touchy on the calibration end, but nothing unmanageable."
3058,2.0,2016-09-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So, I bough this machine in the fall of 2014. I will never ever buy a Breville again. Every time that I descale it with vinegar, the steam stops coming out of the steam wand and instead comes out of the head where you pull your shots. I sent it back while under warranty 3 times for the exact same thing!!! After spending $600, a machine should last for longer than 18 months.
I am now looking at Costco for a machine. If it breaks, Costco will take it back, and I can buy another."
3059,1.0,2018-12-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had 2 versions of this Machine over the last six years. My first one, the grinder broke just after one year. My second one has been going strong since But is now dead. This third one I received from Amazon already broken. I don’t know if this is a negative review of Brevell or of Amazon but put it this way. I am seriously questioning whether I will replace this machine with an identical version or another Breville product at all and I am fully dedicated to never ever again ordering large or sensitive items from Amazon. This item was at least $100 cheaper than the cheapest I’ve seen it and I have a feeling it’s because it was refurbished and refurbished badly."
3060,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works well for our small medical office. Don't expect a drink under 3 to 5 minutes. But it works great and is easy.
3061,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best home espresso machine I ever owned. It takes a bit of getting used to after having fully automatic espresso mchines for the past 9 years. But the effort is worth the quality of the espresso it produces.
3062,5.0,2019-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I cant think of any negative side. A huge bargain for a real espresso machine. A decent burr grinder alone is easily $200 already. This has everything. Semi automatic is the way to go.
3063,5.0,2018-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it I don’t spend my money Starbucks anymore
3064,5.0,2015-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best one!!!!!!! I love it 😍😍😍😍
3065,5.0,2016-10-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it! I made perfect Carmel shots right out of the box. No more $8 drinks!
3066,5.0,2020-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine, I use it every single morning and so far I've had no problems! It does exactly what I need it to do all in a very attractive compact package. I am extremely satisfied with the cup of coffee it produces. Far better than anything I've had at Starbucks for sure!!!!!"
3067,4.0,2016-12-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,pretty nice but could be improved
3068,5.0,2019-06-13, Black Sesame,"great product, using it a few times daily. I purchase freshly roasted beans from a local cafe, makes great latte at home using this machine."
3069,5.0,2021-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,My daughter and daughter in law live these. Now their friends bought them.
3070,1.0,2020-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Although it looked like a cool machine, I was missing pieces and ended up having to return it… what a waste just get a real espresso machine."
3071,5.0,2019-03-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it. It's a coffee shop in my own home 👏
3072,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it so much! make nice coffee everyday
3073,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"More work to do it barista-style but the coffee and lattes are great. Plus, saves us from going to Starbucks....LOL"
3074,5.0,2019-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It is literally perfect , takes a little learning but five stars... Perfect coffee ... ultimate control"
3075,2.0,2020-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this in May, 2016 and in September, 2017 the grinder failed. Made a horrible noise so followed instructions to take it apart and ensure it was clear of any obstructions. After that was done (twice) it had changed to a high pitched whirring noise but would not grind at all. I won't ever buy an espresso machine with a grinder integrated in it again. The machine is so big I don't have space in the cabinet for both the Breville and a separate coffee grinder."
3076,5.0,2021-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use
3077,5.0,2020-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Replace previous model that broke (grinder) after 4 years of heavy daily use - not just us but also friends coming over to enjoy a good coffee. New machine is even better than old one. Good compromise between price and value.
3078,5.0,2016-12-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Good machine, good quality, nice design, and it makes my morning fantastic."
3079,5.0,2019-02-02, Black Sesame,Can’t live without it
3080,1.0,2019-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great product, got clogged after three months. Took a week to get phone call answered, nice gal promised to send a replacement and only charge me if I didn't return the original within 3 weeks. Instead, no replacement sent but credit card charged as if I owed them the original machine back. Haven't returned a phone call or email in weeks since. They pretend to have a system that will call you back so you don't have to wait on hold, but hasn't happened in 7 attempts."
3081,5.0,2020-06-29, Black Sesame,My fiance got this for me for my birthday. We absolutely love it.
3082,5.0,2020-04-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,AMAZING!!! No other words needed to describe this espresso machine
3083,1.0,2019-08-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We started out loving the machine. Very convenient all in one solution. It worked very well. We used it very lightly and maintained it meticulously. However....less than two years in and it is trash. It started leaking from group head. Wouldn’t hold pressure. Wouldn’t switch between water steam. After replacing the gasket, the pump...the solenoid...we are giving up. The machine is too expensive for a two year duration. I will likely step up to a better made machine. Perhaps we just got a bad one? I can’t force myself to purchase again hoping."
3084,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is awesome. Have gone through 3 different machines and this one is by far the best.
3085,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"this is the one to buy. Easy to use, dependable. Excellent tasting espresso."
3086,5.0,2020-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very good coffee machine!!! Recommended!!!
3087,5.0,2015-03-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome machine.
3088,5.0,2018-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fantastic. Still takes a while to steam milk but this is the fastest non-dual boiler frother. If you want to do better you will need to pay 5x the money.
3089,5.0,2018-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this in December 2015 and use it on a daily basis at least 4 to 6 shots a day. Almost everyday. Since the day we received it. I had low maintenance and makes great coffee.
3090,1.0,2020-05-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My partner and I bought this Espresso Machine as a Christmas present for each other this past year (2018). From Christmas morning until about February 20 2019, the espresso was great! The reason for the one star? Ever since that time, every pull in under pressured. Yes, we tried all of the suggestions (more coffee, packed harder, ground finer, etc.) But nothing changes it. We've descaled and cleaned as recommended by the User Manual and changed filters at the appropriate time, so there is no reason the machine should be broken already!

Very disappointed as we didn't even get our money's worth before it became just another piece of junk that is expensive to repair."
3091,5.0,2017-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,LOVEEEE this machine
3092,4.0,2017-10-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works very good other than the water dispencer nob is getting loose
3093,5.0,2019-05-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Unbelievable tasting espresso from this machine! Once I got my setting right I've been happy to say I'm not paying a baristas way through college anymore. The money saved in the long run versus going to the local chain coffee shop adds up quick.
3094,5.0,2014-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine took a little while to learn, but now I can confidently make lattes and Americanos that taste far better than Starbucks."
3095,5.0,2019-07-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Delivers the best Barista
3096,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I haven’t been to coffee shop that has made a better latte than the ones I make on this thing. Absolutely one of my best purchases!
3097,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Amazing machine! Beautiful design and construction. Easy to use and does exactly what it is supposed to.
3098,5.0,2017-11-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very Good Product
3099,5.0,2020-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,This best machine ever
3100,5.0,2016-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,I LOVE THIS MACHINE... this machine is the best buy I have made in years.
3101,5.0,2020-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great espresso maker all around. Had reservations about spending that kind of money, glad I did."
3102,5.0,2020-02-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,How do I put this? my frequent order at starbucks is 5 shots of espresso in a tall cup with 2 inches of steam milk. And I am very satisfied with this machine with 2 shots and about 3 inches of steam milk.
3103,5.0,2020-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine. Simple to use, easy to clean, and makes great coffee."
3104,5.0,2018-10-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,I could write poetry about this machine. I had an earlier version in 2010 or so that broke in a year. This is obviously engineered to avoid the problems my old one had. Bravo.
3105,1.0,2019-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,We've only had the machine for a few weeks and from the very beginning we've had issues with the beans grinding. We have to push the beans down from them to grind which is painful for the price we paid for this machine. We read the reviews and tried a new bean that is not an espresso bean and still have the issue. We finally made the decision to get an upgraded machine after years with a cheap machine and this is the quality we get. :(
3106,5.0,2017-06-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent espresso machine. I can make my own drinks and save money.
3107,1.0,2018-07-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Dear Breville - We purchased this machine in March of this year. We like the drinks that it produced however, the burr grinder has stopped working. It sounds as if the gears are stripped. I have repeatedly called the customer service phone number and left a return phone number because sitting on hold for over half an hour with no response is ridiculous. When this machine was working, I would have given it a 4.5 but now that it is in need of repair and Breville seems to ignore it customer service claims I will give it 1 star out of generosity."
3108,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,We absolutely love this machine! It makes delicious cappuccinos/espressos! This machine is worth every penny!!!
3109,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this espresso machine. I feel so spoiled. :)
3110,5.0,2019-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great quality lattes and the learning curve wasn't bad. I'm way better than starbucks at home. I can't match a San Francisco cafe, but for a home solution I was very impressed.

Pricey, but the daily home latte saves $4 and that adds up quick."
3111,5.0,2020-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great little machine!
3112,5.0,2017-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If the pressure doesn't reach the ""espresso"" zone, try setting the grinder all the way ""fine"" on the left side of the unit. Ours is set to 2.
That did it for us.
Try different beans too.
We like the taste of the coffee this machine produces. 2 weeks into using them, so far so good."
3113,5.0,2016-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great gift
3114,5.0,2016-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best home espresso
3115,5.0,2020-05-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine is good value
Lake coffee get it"
3116,5.0,2014-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing
3117,5.0,2019-07-12, Black Sesame,"I am absolutely IN LOVE with this espresso machine. Makes wonderful coffee once you have all the settings dialed in correctly. I do wish I would have splurged and bought the double broiler option though, just to help speed the coffee making process up."
3118,5.0,2018-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We absolutely love this expresso machine, it is very much worth every penny."
3119,3.0,2016-08-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,One design flaw is that the water tank handle is too weak to hold a full tank. Mine broke where the handle meets the tank during my second water refill. The tank fell on the floor and broke. I recomend to hold the tank with both hands. Never hold the tank from the handle.
3120,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was so excited to get that espresso machine, but unfortunately it didn't make the right espresso. The pressure gauge/pump operating system didn't work. It brewed just regular coffee, not espresso shot. Called Breville customer service and was on hold fo 1.5 hour and then we lost connection. I had to return the machine. Bad experience."
3121,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excelent
3122,5.0,2020-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excelente máquina de expresso, con una alta calidad a buen precio."
3123,2.0,2020-07-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Poor flow control and non standard pitta filter size makes this machine hard to use for actual consistent espresso production. The grinder is nice but that’s about it.
3124,5.0,2019-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Our second purchase. This one a gift.
3125,5.0,2016-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine. Pulls a great shot. Great machine for the price
3126,5.0,2020-06-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best
3127,4.0,2020-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Still trying to find some good coffee though.
3128,5.0,2019-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent!
3129,5.0,2020-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Súper satisfecha con el producto
3130,5.0,2017-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love, love, love!"
3131,5.0,2019-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worth every dollar.....enjoy coffee like I do, invest in this machine....Easy to operate, clean and
makes awesome refreshing cups of coffee"
3132,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have loved this machine from the start. 2 years after owning it it totally crapped out with various problem, Breville, no questions asked, sent out a brand new unit for us! Even though warranty was up.

Makes a great espresso."
3133,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This thing never dispenses the same amount even if you leave the knob alone.
3134,5.0,2017-04-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome machine that makes creamy espresso and dense foamy steamed milk. Awesome machine for the money.
3135,3.0,2017-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Leaking
3136,2.0,2019-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Only worked for one year
3137,1.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This product leaks all over the place, from the inside every time I use it.
I first thought possibly the water reservoir was the issue, however it is perfectly dry.
It's the machine itself, leaking everywhere each time I use it.
I contacted their customer service several times, and they don't answer the phone!
They put you on hold indefinitely! No response! I shouldn't have to call 50 times to get help!
They shouldn't be selling their defective goods on AMAZOn for $600.00 each!"
3138,4.0,2019-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really like this machine but the grinder makes a bit of a mess when it overspills. But other than that, a great machine!"
3139,5.0,2020-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Really beautiful piece of machinery. We make better drinks than the coffee shop now!
3140,5.0,2021-07-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband has never been a coffee drinker until now. That isn't saying anything small since he is 60! He loves this coffee maker and what it creates so much that he is a daily espressor drinker. He takes pleasure in perfecting it.
3141,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I was a barista many years and this machine works really well. Not 100% the same but close enough for me.
3142,5.0,2015-10-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love the machine makes a perfect espresso every time
3143,5.0,2016-02-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes GREAT coffee ...............at home for a lot less!! I haven't figured out the payback time for such a pricey machine vs a daily trip to Starbucks for a latte. But the results are great and I don't have to drive anywhere or wait in line to get my coffee.
3144,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine looks good, but makes so much noise, I can’t use it in my house in the morning, plus it does not froth well. I’m not happy with this machine, my Nespresso machine was much better and easier for use."
3145,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My husband has an expensive expresso habit. After a few weeks of experimenting with beans, grinds, etc, he gets his ideal coffee. We expect we should break even in a few months.

No problems after a month of use. He gets a nice dry puck. Get a tamp box, cuts down on the mess."
3146,5.0,2017-11-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,As expected.
3147,5.0,2017-09-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"good machine, it does require periodical cleaning for best performance. Very happy with purchase, I have been using many espresso machines and would definitely recommend this one."
3148,1.0,2020-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Almost 600 $ machine that does not turn on automatically nor can be turned ON by any 21 st century device, like for example : Tp Link wireless, Alexa, or other. I guess Australia is not up with the times.
Yes, for those naive enough that think they can brew a ""perfect"" espresso coffee in 3 minutes of warm up time, keep dreaming. I have not returned the product because is going to end up costing me money. If you are like me and rely on technology to do things for you and not the other way around, I don't recommend this product."
3149,5.0,2018-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing machine, fantastic lattes Daily! Small learning curve, but I talked to a barrista at Starbucks on the correct ways to froth milk for cappuccinos vs lattes, and now they come out great."
3150,5.0,2017-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,It makes a superb crema and a delicious espresso. Easy to operate. A nice machine for the price.
3151,5.0,2016-07-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best investment ever
3152,5.0,2017-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,ease of grinding the beans
3153,5.0,2016-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love love love this machine. It is easy to use and easy to clean. Makes an amazing cup of cappuccino. I love all Breville products.
3154,5.0,2014-08-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this it makes the best espresso ever
3155,5.0,2015-11-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use
3156,1.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"Super unhappy and frustrated by this machine. I waste so much coffee bc it takes 2-3 attempts to pull a good espresso and I just can't seem to figure out what I'm doing wrong! This machine was hyped up as an easy way to make your own espresso, but it's much more complicated than I expected. I just want to toss it out of the window at this point."
3157,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What luxury to have on my countertop. Some need for practice to get the nice balance but well worth the effort for a perfect cup of latte, americano, or shot of espresso."
3158,1.0,2020-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love to make our espresso every morning, this machine from Amazon is not made to do that apparently. We have had nothing but problems and support has been no help. If you want to have an espresso machine at home, buy from a vendor that will work with you when you have problems. One year warranty my foot!"
3159,5.0,2020-05-10, Black Sesame,"If like me you like espressos, but are relatively clueless about how it is actually made, then this is a great machine to start . It took me a few time to get it to work as required, and now that I managed it I am a very happy user. Everything works as planned."
3160,5.0,2013-10-02, Black Sesame,Does everything we wanted and expected it to do. We are enjoying our espressos!
3161,5.0,2018-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is no debate, this is the espresso machine you want for your house. 100% satisfied with my purchase and ultimately glad I stayed away from a fully automatic machine."
3162,5.0,2018-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,I own 2 of these. One for each home. It’s easy and makes great coffee.
3163,1.0,2020-07-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The pressure gauge no longer works after 10 uses. Also if I don't put hot water to start the espresso will come out cold.
Not sure who to contact. But this wasn't cheap. And I can't return because I'm out tod the return window but we didn't use until just recently."
3164,1.0,2017-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The coffee machine didn’t worked out of the box!
Water pump wasn’t functioning.

Went and bought similar machine from Bed bath and beyond and everything works fine. Maybe the delivery company dropped it a few times….
Again proved the point not to buy electronics from Amazon."
3165,1.0,2018-04-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have been so excited & patiently waiting for this to arrive. Well I just unpacked it. It is used & filthy. I've heard of this happening to others & well it has finally happened to me. Very frustrating! Sending back & ordering from Breville itself.
3166,5.0,2019-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Thank you
3167,5.0,2018-07-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes great espresso. Just use good bean. It takes a bit of trial and error to find the sweet spot re: pressure, but that's what the gauge is for.
Make sure you read the manual and clean it as soon as the clean me lights up."
3168,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,I’m happy with this product I make myself a double latte every morning
3169,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I've had this machine for almost 2 months. I love it!!! I use it at least twice a day everyday. Saves me so much money daily Since I was going to Starbucks twice a day.
3170,5.0,2019-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Apple in fantastic S cup coffee I've had don't have a go to Starbucks or Caribou Coffee anymore make my own
3171,5.0,2020-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it
3172,3.0,2018-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this maker but my package came with some items missing, check your box to make sure everything is complete"
3173,5.0,2021-04-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,It works as described.
3174,5.0,2020-02-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it!!
3175,5.0,2020-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have had over a year now with no issues. Makes great coffeehouse style drinks and fun to learn. Grinder is nice.
3176,3.0,2016-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,It is a decent home espresso maker. It could use a larger pump to better extract the flavor from the bean. Grinder is a plus but does not grind super fine for rich espresso. For the money it is a good deal for an entry level machine with nice features. Just wish it had more extracting power.
3177,5.0,2020-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Made like a tank if you use Primo bottled water. Primo Bottled water can be found at Lowes or Harris Teeter. A comparable water is distilled with minerals added back to water.
3178,5.0,2017-10-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Was hesitant due to the cost but very happy with it.
3179,5.0,2020-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very practice
3180,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Quality build.
3181,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Ok
3182,5.0,2020-09-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,It makes professional shots. Love it! Easy to use
3183,5.0,2017-06-27, Black Sesame,"This thing rocks..!!!!! I was a little nervous buying a machine with the grinder incorporated, but this works well. nice to contain the grind overflow into the cleaning tray, plus, it saves precious counter space. Very easy to operate, stylish, and cranks out Latte's that can't be found anywhere..!!!! No buyers remorse here!!!"
3184,5.0,2016-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love love love!!!!!
3185,5.0,2019-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it
3186,5.0,2019-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So easy to use, just watch the YouTube video. Quality is super great"
3187,1.0,2020-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was very disappointed to find that the built-in burr grinder did not work when I received this unit.
Breville's customer service recommended that I ship it back to them at my expense so they could determine whether to repair or replace it. That was not acceptable to me for a brand new $700 espresso machine.
Thanks to Amazon's return policy I was able to return it at no cost to me and I promptly received a full refund."
3188,5.0,2018-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,FANTASTIC! I used to own a machine that cost 3x as much and it poured out swill relative to the pressure-pumped product you get from Breville. A true amazingly pleasant surprise. WONDERFUL.
3189,5.0,2018-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,The expresso is excellent !
3190,4.0,2016-02-17, Black Sesame,Just received my BRVILLE870XL cant say nor write much about it. so far I like the machine ask me again in a year I sure know then.
3191,5.0,2018-09-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it!!!
3192,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,great machine
3193,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, solid, appears to be a long lasting product"
3194,5.0,2016-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Can't imagine a morning without the machine. Using it was much easier than expected.
3195,5.0,2017-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very easy to use. High quality.
3196,5.0,2019-08-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fantastic ESPRESSO machine...
3197,1.0,2020-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update after 1 year: Started leaking right after one year!!!
Before this espresso-maker, I had $100 Krups espresso-maker that served me for over 10 years. Krups was making about the same quality espresso but it was making 3 times faster froth milk, less noisy, no maintenance. I never used any tablets or powder to decalcite it.
After, I have been using this coffeemaker for 7 months:
Pros: it makes good quality espresso
Cons: High maintenance (requires use of special tablets and powder, which I did not have to use before)
Leaking sometimes for unknown reasons
It takes too long to froth milk
Became very noisy that I feel like I need earplugs"
3198,5.0,2017-05-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,good
3199,5.0,2018-09-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have been using this nearly every day since I got it and LOVE it. I usually drink 4 shots per morning and start to finish can have my latte done in under 10mins.
Bean hopper holds about 1/2 lb of beans and I have had no issues with oily beans."
3200,5.0,2020-03-03, Black Sesame,Excelente producto
3201,5.0,2019-04-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love the built-in grinder. Easy to use.
I wish the steam wand was longer.
Great home espresso machine.

3203,5.0,2020-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product.
3204,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,Easy to use
3205,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nice
3206,5.0,2017-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,had it for a year no without issues I love it.
3207,5.0,2020-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Life Changing
3208,2.0,2019-12-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"These machines, while impressive at first sight and initially capable of doing what they are advertised to do, break down with alarming regularity. Loathe to give in to instinct and ""toss the carcass"" we have embarked on several fix-it missions to prolong the patient's life. To no avail. We understand heavy use can take a toll but regular maintenance and loving care should count for something. There does appear to be an obsolescence factor built into these machines and - if you stick with the brand - their use can be expensive."
3209,5.0,2021-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product!!
3210,5.0,2020-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine makes wonderful espresso. Easy to use. Has held up well so far.
3211,5.0,2016-06-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great for the price, milk frothing is slow to start, but works great once it heats-up. Grinding seems perfect and very easy to pull a perfect shot each time since grinding puts out the same amount each time."
3212,5.0,2020-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome
3213,5.0,2017-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great purchase
3214,1.0,2017-06-13, Black Sesame,Not worth the money. There are plenty of other brands for far less that will produce better. I’ve had this machine for less than 2 months and the pressure is minimal and the double shot barely produces 20 ml of espresso. I’ve read the manual and watched plenty of “how to” videos and still get underwhelming espresso.
3215,1.0,2020-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What an absolute joke. This espresso machine broke just shortly after our year warranty and whenever something breaks no matter what it is they wanna charge you $300 to fix it. Just got off the phone with customer support and what a joke. DO
NOT BUY. Spend a little more money on something with a better warranty that will last longer."
3216,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,perfection
3217,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It’s difficult to troubleshoot. It frequently doesn’t reach pressure. I’ve wasted so much good coffee trying to get it to work properly. For the price, it’s a major disappointment."
3218,5.0,2019-10-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it.
3219,5.0,2019-11-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine!
3220,5.0,2019-07-25, Black Sesame,Makes a terrific espresso.
3221,4.0,2019-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far so good! Still learning how to balance the pressure for a great espresso!
3222,2.0,2019-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend list Christmas. A few days before this Christmas, it no longer works.

The faux stainless steel finish was super easy to scratch. The panel behind cup rest looks as tho the finish is coming off.

It did make a pretty good latte but for what it costs, I would expect it to last longer than a year."
3223,5.0,2020-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,The design is very pretty. a little bigger than i imagine!! great quality overall
3224,1.0,2020-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had to return it. I went to college , but I don’t have a Ph D to operate this machine unfortunately , cause that is what you will need. Steamer wasn’t foaming the milk , espresso machine never or rarely was in the espresso pressure zone. I wasted my time and I had very high hopes with it since I’ve done so much research prior to buy it and the machine was on top 5 on different websites. If you are looking for a easy to operate espresso machine with nice foamy milk , this is not the one , unless you go to a barista school ."
3225,1.0,2020-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,I did not get a chance to test as I returned immediately after opening. The packing tape was misaligned when initial opening of product which I thought was odd. Wet when taking out water container from machine. The bean hopper was MISSING!
3226,5.0,2020-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best espresso machine. Great foam-better than most restaurants!!
3227,1.0,2019-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Do not buy this machine. I had better coffee on my 100 machine. It is not consistent!
3228,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use and very dependable.
3229,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,thank you
3230,5.0,2016-09-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine. Bought to replace failing Delonghi Magnifica.
3231,5.0,2020-02-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wanted to wait until I had plenty of experience with this machine before I reviewed it - had about 3 months. We use this multiple times every day - excellent product!!!!
3232,5.0,2017-10-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have only had it for a few weeks, but this espresso machine does a fantastic job. I am very happy with this product so far."
3233,5.0,2017-09-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome machine!!
3234,5.0,2016-06-28, Black Sesame,Great machine and I'm enjoying my morning coffee at a cheaper price. This make just as good a coffee that I purchased at the coffee shops.
3235,5.0,2019-09-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best home use expresso machine by far.
3236,5.0,2017-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is so incredibly well build! Can make a latte in under 2 minutes!
Very impressive australian engineering."
3237,1.0,2017-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this machine for my girlfriend for Christmas, she loves espresso and I thought it would be a good gift for her, to be able to make her own coffee. Breville's online video instructions make this machine look easy to use, but it's deceptively complex. We have yet to be able to pull anything more than oily, ultra-bitter espresso out of the machine, and while I'll concede that our experience with this sort of thing is minimal, we are following the instructions to the T. I've called Breville asking for tips to see what we're doing wrong, and most of the information I was told on the phone actually conflicted with the instruction manual and quick start. I thought, given this is a highly rated unit, I'd be giving one of the best gifts I'd ever given, turns out it's one of the worst. What a terrible frustration and tremendous waste of money."
3238,5.0,2022-05-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have had this machine for a month and are very happy with it. It makes great espresso and cappuccino and is easy to use.
3239,5.0,2020-07-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Coffee
3240,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had a much cheaper, simpler espresso unit (Krups) for years and it was quite good. The espresso from this is significantly better and well worth the extra cost. The manual tamping is a bit messy but less to go wrong than the ""super"" units. Very happy so far."
3241,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love love love. I look forward to morning just to make my beautiful cup of joy!!!
3242,5.0,2019-12-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had another brand before, which I thought was great, till I got this one."
3243,5.0,2014-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent machine for the weekend barista and for those rushed mornings when you want a cappuccino.
3244,5.0,2019-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Simply amazing
3245,2.0,2018-06-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,It leaks and my husband threw away the box so I can’t return it
3246,2.0,2017-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes great espresso shots and is very user friendly. Unfortunately it started giving me problems after only a few weeks of use, so I sent it back!"
3247,5.0,2017-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Super thanks
3248,5.0,2019-10-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Look no further. This is it people. Tried it with pre-ground Lavazza and worked ok with the dual wall filters. As soon as I got fresh beans and ground them it made huge difference. Excellent quality for the money. Grinder works perfect. The grind amount adjustment works a bit weird.

3253,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best espresso maker that I ever used.
3254,1.0,2020-04-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 Ive been researching espresso makers for years and had my eye on the Breville barista due to the consistent high scoring reviews. I received my Breville today. Followed the instructions for set up. Almost dialed in the grind. But issues arose when I went to use the water dispenser and steam wand. It spits and sputters. But does dispense a stream of water or a steady stream of steam. Breville customer support is not available on the weekend. Disappointed thus far."
3255,5.0,2018-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it
3256,5.0,2020-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Ok

Works perfect.. Year 1"
3259,2.0,2019-11-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have a hard time getting much froth on the top of my espresso shots and when the dial is set to grind coffee more fine, the water gets choked up and does not push through into the cup. I thought this would be better for $600."
3260,5.0,2017-08-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine! Worth every penny, I prefer americanos from home over a coffee shop now"
3261,5.0,2016-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,better than expected. we love our morning lattes. get one and you could too.
3262,5.0,2019-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,For the money I think this is the best espresso maker out there.

3269,5.0,2020-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Really easy to use. Watch a video on utube to make it really simple. Glad I decided on this one.
3270,4.0,2020-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Only had it for a few weeks, but espresso tastes great and easy to use. Pretty loud, but would prefer that to bad tasting coffee."
3271,5.0,2021-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine!! Absolutely love it. Works great and makes great drinks. No problem whatsoever except I guess learning to use it which can't be helped. Making drinks and such takes practice which I am always looking forward to with this machine
3272,2.0,2019-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Overall good espresso machine. Does pretty good job, when it works. The quality of the product is below average, especially the steamer knob. The steamer knob worked well for 2 weeks on first unit. Now the replacement unit knob is already starting to act up after few weeks as well. I called Breville customer support, after waiting on phone for a while, I left my phone number for the call back request. Never heard back from Breville. I would not recommend it"
3273,5.0,2017-12-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love my machine! Also makes a great cup off coffee. Only draw back it gets dirty from over flow of coffee grinds.
3274,5.0,2017-09-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,This espresso machine is easy to use ans easy to clean. The coffee comes out really good.
3275,4.0,2020-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,The machine is good and easy to operate. There is one thing that I could not adjust to the right amount of coffee. Over all the machine is great.
3276,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The most frustrating aspect about this product was producing a decent espresso shot. It wasn’t as much about the functionality of the product as it was about the science (formula) behind making an espresso. And don’t let the tutorials on YouTube convince you otherwise. I ultimately gave up after so many failed attempts and returned the devise.

Additionally, if saving money is at play, the juice isn’t worth the squeeze. In other words, while you might save a buck or two, the headaches from concocting some shots out weights the unnoticeable savings."
3277,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good
3278,4.0,2019-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far so good.

3286,4.0,2020-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,The only thing against it is it a little messy but other than that I will never need to go to Starbucks again also it makes u understand coffee more
3287,5.0,2019-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,WORTH EVERY PENNY. I have not been to Starbucks ever since. This will pay itself off in no time!!

3292,5.0,2019-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine. Makes great espressos.
3293,1.0,2018-09-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Save yourself from headache . The worst customer service you will ever experience is from Breville. I will never buy breville product again .

When the machine broke from cleaning , breville told me that it is because we use stale coffee beans which I purchased at Costco. He said , we should only buy fresh coffee beans NOT purchased from Starbucks or Costco? What a lame excuse . I was glad I purchased it at Amazon and they helped me out get my refund. Buy Delonghi brand instead. Way better product and customer service is great !!!"
3294,5.0,2019-08-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this product for my wife and she loves it so far. Time will tell!
3295,5.0,2020-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee with this machine
3296,5.0,2014-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good machine great and fast.
3297,2.0,2019-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It is not easy to setup and manage. There is a lot of water that seems to accumulate at the bottom of the machine, almost 4 cups full every couple of days (odd and don't know why). There are many gauges that don't move and don't know for what they are, need to read gobbs of documentation to figure out. It is COFFEE, it should be simple."
3298,5.0,2019-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes great espresso. Convenient and reliable. Breville has excellent customer support.
3299,1.0,2019-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"BEWARE. I ordered a new machine but this one came very obviously used. There were coffee grounds inside the packaging and inside the grinder. There were also marks on the outside of the machine. And as you can see by the underside picture, water has been put thru it. Look your machine over carefully when you Unbox it."
3300,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"LOVE THIS ESPRESSO MACHINE. I use it daily, haven't had issues with it yet."
3301,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far, so good. Almost a month. Makes perfect coffee, strong and with cream."
3302,5.0,2018-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso. Great deal for the price
3303,5.0,2021-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best espresso machine I ever owned!! If you are coffee lover... don't look any further. This is the one!
3304,5.0,2017-03-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine..easy to use looks great and makes a great espresso.
3305,4.0,2018-09-27, Black Sesame,"Love my new coffee maker!! Very easy to operate, great coffee, cleans easily, looks great Just wish it was a little quieter for those early mornings!!"
3306,5.0,2020-08-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,The temperature is excellent and easy to clean
3307,5.0,2016-08-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I read all reviews from all different sources and this is one of the best express espresso machine i have used.It 's made my day.Thanks
3308,1.0,2019-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this as a surprise gift for my girlfriend's birthday and the pressure gauge didn't work from day one.

We've done the various tests with the cleaning disk as recommended by Breville's YouTube channel (where the comments were conveniently turned off) - and the needle didn't move at all. I looked online and this is apparently a common manufacturing / QA problem with a lot of customers.

It's pretty unacceptable to sell a machine just south of $600 to have a basic function not work. Very disappointing."
3309,5.0,2020-02-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is life changing. My hubby and I really love making our espresso's each morning. Highly recommend.
3310,5.0,2015-09-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,The coffee it made taste really great!
3311,5.0,2020-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wow. I used to own a coffee shop and a machine valued at 10k. This little Breville makes a just as amazing espresso. Effortlessly!
3312,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,So excited to have this! Loving it!
3313,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I could go on and on about this thing but, suffice it to say, you will not regret this purchase. We haven't purchased a coffee in two months since buying it. Bravo Breville!"
3314,4.0,2014-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,wish the wand had a little more power but its a great machine
3315,4.0,2018-09-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good fine grind. Good strong coffee out the other end. Definitely the one for my kitchen!
3316,5.0,2020-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes great espresso, can make 5 at a time when guests come over. Haven't bought any coffee from cafés since I bought this machine (and I'm from Seattle, home of the best coffee around)."
3317,5.0,2021-12-28, Black Sesame,Excelente y fácil de usar. Para el mejor café mañanero
3318,5.0,2020-03-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee and finally a good flat white. Easy to use for a novice!
3319,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far i am very impressed,good machine,impressive quality for price"
3320,5.0,2018-06-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Looks great, bigger than I expected, but so far works great."
3321,5.0,2021-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works well.. easy to use and makes a great late...
3322,5.0,2016-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Working really well so far. Sometimes the grounds don't come out after brewing but we work around.
3323,2.0,2020-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am in Mongolia and asked my friend to bring it here when he visits Mongolia. The shipment in America and delivery to Mongolia were seamless and successful. However, when I tried the machine first day, after several tasting attempts the grinder stopped working. I've tried all possible ways by reading the manual and searching it in Youtube, so unfortunately all my efforts didn't bring any success. So, I have been using it for only for espresso purpose. A bit disappointed."
3324,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Nightmare maintenance. The steam ring has had to be replaced twice -- yes, normal wear and tear, everyone will need to do this at some point. However, Breville does not have these silicone rings in stock much of the time. What's more, their website does not allow you to order replacement parts from it -- one must call in old-fashioned style to customer service (good luck!). As of now, we need our third steam ring replacement, but they are on backorder for 6 weeks. What that means is we can not use our espresso machine, yet again. We will not buy Breville products in the future, it's the after service, or lackthereof, which makes the experience frustrating."
3325,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine. This took a little time to setup the grind settings and the amount on grounds needed. Once set it was easy. Love having a great cup of latte during the day. No more going out for my coffee.
3326,5.0,2015-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"so easy to use and the best coffee ever!!!! Love the quick ""americano"" in the morning."
3327,1.0,2020-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,I received a used machine. There were coffee grounds all over the machine and spilling out of the plastic. I returned it and went to Best Buy and bought a NEW one for the same price.
3328,5.0,2020-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wow, awesome coffee maker. Life is more enjoyable now. I will come back and add more comment after a period of time using it. Now we are learning to make Latte and American coffee using this."
3329,1.0,2015-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wanted to love it. I really did. I’ve been a barista for 4 years and know how to work an espresso machine. A week after arrival it stopped pressurizing, I sent it back and Amazon sent me a new one. Not even a year later my new one isn’t pressurizing either."
3330,5.0,2020-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Loving this! Great tasting coffee every morning.
3331,5.0,2017-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,good and fast shipment
3332,5.0,2019-11-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As a first time owner of an expresso machine, it does a really great job telling me when my expresso is just right. The guage is a life saver for the beginner."
3333,5.0,2020-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Review # 1,500. Its so easy to use. Now I drink too much coffee."
3334,5.0,2020-01-28, Black Sesame,"The best coffee maker. Good quality, great coffee, easy to operate."

3337,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,VERY NICE MACHINE
3338,1.0,2019-10-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,I'm so disappointed in this product. The grinder broke within 6 months. I called Breville to use my warrenty and get it fix. I Everytime I called (I called about 8 times) they said they sent an email containing return information and they will fix it. The emails never came and I soon realized the warranty didn't matter and they had no intention on fixing it. Please don't spend your money on this.
3339,1.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine doesn’t work, can’t get it to pull shots correctly, constantly clogging, funky fast and smell from water. Bad quality product- do not purchase."
3340,5.0,2019-05-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband absolutely loves it! He keeps it in his office and his buddies come and take brakes. He makes me jealous talking about the fabulous crèma it produces. 5 stars!

 excellent machine for the price"
3342,5.0,2020-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso from this machine. Just as good as the coffee shops I (used) to go to. It'll pay for itself this year!
3343,5.0,2020-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s an art...It will take a lifetime to master...I love it.
3344,5.0,2019-04-05, Black Sesame,"Like it very much, no complaints"
3345,5.0,2020-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this for my husbands birthday gift and we love it! Works great and makes really good coffee! We are saving so much money making our own coffee at home.
3346,5.0,2020-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,the true taste of natural coffee
3347,3.0,2019-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worked great for the first month and now it's not performing as expected. Trouble shooting is hard and I used to be a barista!
3348,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Me encanta como sale el café!🤗
3349,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Works great. However, I just realized that I started to drink so much coffee. If only one person gonna use this it's gonna be too much."
3350,4.0,2015-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Not as good as a Pasquini but a good espresso machine for the cost. Neat and easy to use. The coffee bean grinder is great.
3351,4.0,2016-11-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,The steamer takes a bit. Other than that seems to work great.
3352,5.0,2019-12-31, Black Sesame,Outstanding espresso machine. It is delicious and consistent.
3353,5.0,2019-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wonderful, It gives me pleasure and fabulous coffee every day!! And it is beautiful!!"
3354,5.0,2019-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is an excellent quality and beautifully designed kitchen object. The coffee it produces is constantly superb as is the foam. Be sure to follow instructions for getting grind size to grind amount ratio correct and you'll hit the sweet spot on your pressure gauge.
3355,5.0,2019-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome!!!!! It is so great to have espresso at home again. This machine works great and is exactly what we were looking for!!!!
3356,5.0,2018-05-09, Black Sesame,This machine is amazing. I honestly could not be happier with my purchase.
3357,5.0,2017-10-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great quality coffee, works like a charm, if you want to drink good quality coffee buy this machine, very good price."
3358,5.0,2020-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,It make perfect coffee everyday for my wife. so much better than my previous espresso machine. Worth every penny.
3359,5.0,2019-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works like to big boy machines
3360,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very disappointed with this product, cheap material, leaks, the espresso was cold, I try several times espresso was cold, I though I was doing something wrong, the set up it was fine according to the manual, I returned the machine the second day that it was received, I won’t recommend this machine, I did not fulfill my expectations, for the price it is not worthy !"
3361,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine. It took a couple days to master, but now it is a breeze to use. Very well made and has many features that make it a very good quality espresso machine (at an appealing price!). Highly recommend."
3362,5.0,2015-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Wow
Great coffee
Makes it fun to create"
3363,2.0,2018-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,used it very little and it started to not pour a full shot. Cleaned the unit as the directions said twice and still no full shots. We have to turn the hot water on before the shot comes out to get a full shot.......I would not recomend this to any one that is going to make a coffee every morning
3364,5.0,2019-11-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"By by Starbucks, hello Breville. This machine was worth every penny."
3365,1.0,2019-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine this past January. Within a month, it started having problem of grinding coffee bean. I drink coffee twice a day only. But I have to do an advanced cleaning almost every week because of this defect. So I called Breville service line for an exchange since it is under one-year warranty. The company said that it could be repaired but would charge me an additional $239 plus tax. What kind of warranty is this? I am very disappointed."
3366,5.0,2022-03-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this!!!! Makes great foam. Quiet..grinder works very well!
3367,5.0,2019-08-13, Black Sesame,Been using every day since I got it. This thing is awesome!
3368,2.0,2017-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Product didn’t come with a Manual. Leading me to believe it was a return that was re boxed.
3369,5.0,2020-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome product. Learning curve isn’t too bad.
3370,1.0,2022-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worst experience ever. Made the most fabulous espresso shots. Broke 3 days and three lattes later. Grinder making awful grinding sound and no ground coffee. The method indicated to un jam grinder was difficult and after completion it still was still not working. Sent back to Amazon and ordered another with extended warranty, just in case. Opened up new machine and grinder did the same thing immediately. Called Breville customer support and was on hold for 45 minutes and they never picked up. Retuned again. Will never buy a Breville product again. Overpriced junk!"
3371,5.0,2019-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent Product it works great and the coffee tastes delicious, easy to use. Totally worth it"
3372,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have enjoyed the unit so far.
3373,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Exceeded expectations. Great value.
3374,5.0,2018-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely LOVE this machine. I wish I would have bought it years ago.
3375,5.0,2018-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, even for someone with no experience pulling shots. Looks great in my kitchen."
3376,5.0,2020-08-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,5 out of 5 !
3377,5.0,2019-04-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome. Easy adjustments awesome coffee
3378,5.0,2022-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Use this every weekend. I love it. Would not go without it. Great job breville. Make sure you buy some nice beans to go with this unit.
3379,5.0,2020-01-05, Black Sesame,Fantastic price and excellent quality espresso machine !!!
3380,5.0,2021-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great coffee machine. I absolutely love it.
High quality and great look. But the noise is too much"
3381,4.0,2018-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,It was more than I expected and works great
3382,1.0,2020-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This product came to me used and missing parts. I’m not sure if Amazon did this or if breville signed off on it but seems pretty crappy seeing as the product is 700$

Update:

Product from bed bath and beyond is fantastic 5/5 easily. I recommend this product if you want to step up your espresso game"
3383,5.0,2018-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Grinder
I own a $500 Baratza grinder. It doesn't work half as well as the one on this machine. The Baratza often stalls with fresher, dark beans. The Breville never does. And it gets down to as fine a powder as you could want.

Steam
This is my first espresso machine, but I can't see the wand working much better than this one does. Milk out of the fridge goes from 45 degrees to 165 in less than a minute. The result is easy and awesome: smooth, rich microfoam. Not sure why some say this can be tricky. Am I missing something?

Pulling a Shot
At first, this machine was coming up way short. Shots were bitter. When pulling a shot, the pressure barely got into the gray area. Didn't matter how fine I ground or how hard I tamped. But finally, I got some fresh beans, and everything changed. Now, it comes right up to pressure. And shots are not bitter or sour. Good crema with very little dialing in. Who knew the age of the beans is so important.

So, I'm thrilled with this unit. For entry-level in the world of espresso machines, this thing gets the job done. You can really taste and smell the flavor of the beans in the drink, which makes all the difference. And the machine heats up in minutes. I don't think my palette is refined enough that I need to heat up the group head for 20 minutes before pulling the shot. When I do, I don't seem to notice an improvement.

Maybe in my next life I will get the ECM Synchronika. For now, I'm fine."
3384,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought t our Barista Express two years ago. In terms of functionality it worked fine and we enjoyed it. However, two years the electronics went haywire. They do not give parts to local repair facilities. This you have to go through them to get a repair. It will be $250 to repair it, with only a six-month guarantee afterwards. Caveat emptor."
3385,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"High quality and durable, I'm enjoying it thus far."
3386,1.0,2020-07-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes delicious lattes and is very easy to use.

Update:
We have found this machine to be extremely inconsistent. We have always used the same beans, but the amount that the grinder dispenses isn't the same. Lately it has been over pressure despite how little we tamp. Today went through a pound of coffee and never got a good shot. Tamped hard, tamped almost not at all and it was still barely dripping espresso out. From 5 to 1 star. The inconsistency is too great."
3387,2.0,2019-03-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine makes as good or better lattes than Starbucks or your local coffee shop (after much practice).

I wish I knew which part(s), chemical(s), and/or compound(s) required Breville to add a CA Prop 65 warning to the owners manual about the machine. Also, I don't see the reason for the plastic piece in the basket. I took this plastic piece out."
3388,5.0,2020-12-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is an excellent, well thought out product. Works totally as described, easy to set-up, use and maintain. Great espresso!"
3389,5.0,2020-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine! Have not had any of the issues others are talking about.
3390,5.0,2017-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s easy to clean!!! very good quality!!!
3391,5.0,2017-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine, so simple to use, great tasting drinks and looks like it should be in a coffee shop not in my kitchen"
3392,1.0,2019-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife was a Barista and this machine drives her crazy. Often you need to make several cups before you get the right ground, compaction, etc., so it's wasteful. Also, it's a complicated machine to master (if you can). Often the cup insert sticks to the machine when you go to remove the handle. Lastly, quality of the stainless steel (what little there is on the machine) is of poor quality. Has already started to rust (see photos) after just four months. Made in China - need I say more.."
3393,4.0,2017-06-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great! Now I'm a coffee snob.
3394,1.0,2018-02-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I quite like the machine and it makes tasty coffee. However, the mechanism that times how long to brew failed quite quickly on mine and both the 1 and 2 shot buttons don't reliably stop without hitting the button again. This has resulted in some messes when not ready to pounce.

Also, despite filling a support ticket with Breville, no response."
3395,5.0,2018-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I really like this espresso machine. It is easy to refill beans and water. Milk froths quickly. Stainless is easy to clean.
3396,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very disappointed with the performance of this machine, literally you can get the same or even better coffee with a machine that costs 5 time less than breville , I have a capresso ( $90 ) and got very good espresso every time, the milk steamer is very good though."
3397,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee at home!
3398,5.0,2017-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Super
3399,2.0,2020-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Loved it so much I bought 2 more for Christmas gifts for my kids - then the grinder just quit - one day it's working - next day it won't start. Waiting to hear from the company.
3400,5.0,2020-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far, Amazing! We have only had it a week, but it makes the best cup of coffee! It's not too difficult, but we're still figuring it all out.☺️"
3401,1.0,2019-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve wanted to love this machine, but the frother and lack of double boiler makes it too time consuming. The frother is weak, the cheap parts that easily bend, I am disappointed in the quality, how cheap it all feels. The first time I do not like a Breville product, I own 6 of their kitchen appliances."
3402,5.0,2020-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After honeymooning in Italy, it didn't take long for my husband and I to become addicted to their delicious coffee. So naturally we had to purchase something to help our cravings. It's easy to use, and works great. Highly recommend."
3403,5.0,2019-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nothing better than this machine. Good expresso coffe every day.
3404,5.0,2019-08-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought for my daughter. She loves it
3405,5.0,2020-02-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"exceptional machine, creates very good coffee and chocolate"
3406,5.0,2020-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,great coffee maker. i used same coffee and the difference is great it also makes the best cappuccino frothing the milk turns foamy and creamy
3407,1.0,2019-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel," Not worth $700!!!

After reading the book, watch a milion tutorials on YouTube and spending hours of trying different settings I return this machine!

For $700 I expect to wake up in the morning and have my coffee READY IN MINUTS!!!"
3408,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. She had done the research, and this is all she wanted. It got to the point that she was weighing the coffee and had the temp and pressure dialed in exactly where the directions recommended and it just tasted off. We spent a small fortune on coffee trying different types in the hopes that “this will be the one”. In the end, we gave up, returned it and bought a pour over setup. It makes MUCH better coffee."
3409,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this during the 2020 pandemic. It is soo worth the investment. I no longer visit Starbucks and I paid for this item in just 3 months of Starbucks runs. Invest in great coffee beans and this latte tastes better than Starbucks. You can ice or drink hot. I can now have my expression shots after dinner everyday!
3410,5.0,2019-06-12, Black Sesame,Great product
3411,3.0,2019-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Steamer not so great. Tastes spectacular.
3412,1.0,2019-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Took 3 brews to dial in the pressure/tamp/temp, which is expected. Steam wand is good, but still an after thought on this machine. What sucked was 1 day later and the double shot setting just stopped functioning. It only purged out in the drip tray. No pressure, no espresso. Considering that’s the primary function of this machine, and the other added features in the unit do not matter without a brew. At this price point, I’d rather go Italian or German built and get what I came for...the espresso!!!"
3413,5.0,2018-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,I really love this machine
3414,5.0,2019-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,What a fabulous toy this contraption has been! We're now making fabulous beverages daily and it's really easy to clean. Sure beats the old $30 Mr. Coffee machine!
3415,5.0,2019-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing espresso machine. Easy to use and troubleshoot, the manual does a great job explaining things. The machine is so stream lined and user friendly."
3416,5.0,2018-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!!!!! Making a PERFECT cappuccino is simple with this machine. I have used it at least once every day for about 4 months and have not had any problems with it at all.
3417,5.0,2017-08-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love our breville semi. The barista wanna-be in me is so happy with every brew. Easy to use and very low maintenance.
3418,2.0,2020-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Used once a day for a year does not build up pressure
3419,5.0,2016-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have made around 100 drinks on this so far. It meets and exceeds our expectations. You have to figure what grind, tamp pressure and beans are right for you but that is part of the enjoyment to us."
3420,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Entertaining for home events
3421,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good
3422,5.0,2017-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great machine! We use it every morning and it consistently produces great crema cafe and wonderful, frothy milk.

Take a little time to adjust the grind and the grind amount and you'll get perfect espresso everytime!"
3423,5.0,2021-07-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Facil de usar
3424,3.0,2017-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,It's partly automatic but still requires operator involvement unlike the more expensive Magnifica by Delonghi. The one outstanding shortcoming is the weak steamer....slow and weak in comparison.....be patient with that feature and you are ok as you will get a decent machine for the money.
3425,5.0,2019-04-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this thing, its my daily GOTO for coffee!"
3426,5.0,2016-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine
3427,5.0,2019-12-14, Black Sesame,I love my coffee machine! It took a little bit to get used to the milk foamer but i figured it out after a few times. I love it that it grinds the coffee fresh for every coffee.
3428,1.0,2013-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased as an anniversary gift. Took time to read instructions and watch online videos. Put beans in hopper, pressed button and just a high squeal. No grind. Tried fewer beans. Squeal. The machine itself may make a great espresso but I was paying for a machine with all components working. Returned day after anniversary...but we did it together and went out for a nice cappuccino."
3429,5.0,2018-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome! if a bit messy to deal with. My coffee is now better than starbucks!
3430,5.0,2020-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Although it took a couple of tries to get it ""right"" we love this espresso machine. I am glad we decided we were worth the splurge."
3431,1.0,2020-05-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Do not recommend. We bought it a little over a year ago and grinder completely stopped working, it won’t turn on, like there is no power to it. It’s very disappointing since it was expensive gadget and we hoped to get more use out of it. I searched online and apparently that’s a common issue."
3432,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best espresso machine for hone use
3433,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"A great machine. After about two days of experimentation, it is easy to get perfect espresso in less then a minute. Easy to clean, and sturdy. Use good beans! I use Illy or Lavazza... Avoid oily ones.

I am perfectly satisfied."
3434,1.0,2013-10-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I should have returned this earlier though kept trying different settings, grind sizes, amount of grinds, packaged coffee grinds and contacted support though they couldn't do much to troubleshoot. The pressure gauge does not register to much into the pre-infusion setting and does not reach the espresso setting. While espresso tastes ok, I find I need to put it on the double cup setting versus the single setting which leads me to believe there is an issue with the pressure mechanism based on deduction. If you notice this, consider returning it quickly before your 30 day window passes."
3435,5.0,2020-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it- cut way down on Starbucks purchases!
3436,5.0,2020-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great purchase! Make great coffee (better than what I have at the local cafe).
3437,5.0,2018-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,very easy to make coffee！look nice
3438,5.0,2017-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm not a materialistic person, but this truly makes me happy. It's not difficult to use, it's easy to clean and it makes a damn fine cappuccino. Simply perfect."
3439,5.0,2020-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this product.Saving us $1,800 per year in Starbucks expenses. It will pay for itself in 3 more months Hooray!!"
3440,5.0,2018-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Use it every day loven it
3441,5.0,2022-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect!
3442,2.0,2015-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes great espresso! Cappuccino too as the frothing function works well. This is my third Breville Espresso maker and I guess I'll give up after this. They don't seem to last much past a year. 13 months after purchase it stopped dispensing coffee - the pump has no pressure. The last two I had broke after 12-15 months as well. I just think it's too expensive a product to replace every year or so!
3443,1.0,2015-07-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,After two months of coffee my pump has stopped producing espresso. I am using the same settings from day one but now literally nothing comes out of the pump. I am working with technical support right now but it feels like they aren't going to do anything about as we've gone back and forth for a week now. I hope no one has the same experience as I did.
3444,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent
3445,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great piece of equipment - take the time to read and follow the instructions - you will love it!
3446,5.0,2019-10-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love to buy this product. No regret!
3447,5.0,2016-05-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,It's a great coffee maker specially when we talking about Espresso I love it.
3448,5.0,2014-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"as Italian I was looking at a good espresso maker, without spending a fortune. This machine makes a great coffee with a variety of different settings to meet everyone's taste. Great purchase!"
3449,5.0,2020-05-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,if you are hesitating on the price DONT! GET THIS MACHINE! BEST INVESTMENT EVER! NO MORE $6 DAILY! <3
3450,5.0,2019-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome cappuccino machine. So automatic. Froths the milk great too. Highly recommend
3451,2.0,2019-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It broke after 2 weeks of making about 4 drinks per day. The water extraction won't stop unless it runs out or I push a button. Followed every recommended troubleshooting and Breville is offering me to ship a new one. I am debating whether to get a different model or give another try. But overall, it's a good value compared to price features and other similar machines. The hardest part is getting a consistent extraction. Does require some experimenting but once you learn I get Starbucks' or better quality shots."
3452,5.0,2019-12-12, Black Sesame,"Over I highly recommend it!

So I bought this machine for $700 and bought the Breville Touch for $1000 at the same time first week of 2022. One for home and one for office. I am not a barista, I just enjoy coffee. I’ll try to share my biggest tips and takeaways.

Touch v. Regular

I find the coffee I can make is the same, but the regular seems to drip more water in the tray underneath than the touch. Especially during steaming. It takes much longer to begin producing steam, and in general isn’t as nice. It also isn’t quite as beginner friendly, but there are so many videos I wouldn’t worry too much. Although the little needle gets the pressure very close and the Touch doesn’t show that, so in the beginning that can take longer to figure out what grind size you need. Also the foam auto produced by the touch is never as silky smooth as the micro foam you can do by hand. So even though it can do it, I prefer doing it manually. For the price Regular is probably the better choice. But I prefer the Touch.

Tips:
You don’t really need the razor looking piece, as long as you dial in how long to grind the bean it will give you a consistent amount.

I recommend around 12 fine-ness to start. Everyone says buying coffee beans from a local place with a “Roasted On” date is better. I’m the beginning I couldn’t get with the darker stronger roast coffee and got the lightest possible. As I became accustomed to it though now I’m good with either.

I have come to enjoy my coffee black when the taste is actually good with 2 Splendas, but lattes are much tastier.

Steaming the milk is automated on the touch, but it’s never micro-foamy. Just foam. So I do it manually regardless unless someone loves foam and wants a cappuccino. But key is to get the milk swirling, lower the cup to get some air introduced maybe only 10 seconds or so, then raise the cup so the steam tip goes lower and heats/swirls the microfoamy milk. This takes the most tinkering with to make cool patterns.

Watch some videos on how to create patterns but don’t be discouraged if it takes forever to get it down. Just be aware if it was too foamy or two milky and adjust.

By no means at I am expert, just an average dude who learned to make a 9/10 cup of coffee. You can too.

Get the knock box

Rinse the coffee residue off by pressing the cup button (to pull a shot of espresso) and this cleans the area the coffee grounds touch in between cups of coffee.

Don’t get the higher walled extension piece, you know need it.

Do use the ramp to press it down and make sure it’s even.

Drink coffee you like. If you buy beans and don’t like the taste, try different ones.

Buy wash clothes or use paper towels and wipe it down in between cups.

It runs out of water and fills up the tray around the same time. Rinse out the tray and fill up water all at once, probably 2-3 times a week. But we’ll worth the extra work.

Perfect in between industrial grade machine and just a Keurig. And it will definitely be worth the cost over time.

Buy syrups and creamers if you’re into Starbucks style coffee. But it’s good without any as well.

I’m sure I missed a lot but that sums up my thoughts. Just keep practicing and you’ll get it!"
3453,5.0,2015-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excelente para el hogar
3454,5.0,2020-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes great espresso
3455,5.0,2017-05-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Like it!
3456,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Made amazing shots for one week and then the rest was history. Did not change beans nor amount....really unpredictable wasted a ton of beans. So bummed loved how it performed the first week but for $500 a bit paranoid to reorder....back to the drawing board.
3457,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far so good. The proof will be with how long it lasts.
3458,5.0,2020-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best 500 bucks ive ever spent. This machine makes great espresso!
3459,5.0,2015-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is made me enjoy coffee more. Make sure you turn the grind dial to #1 which is the finest; if you do this you’ll reach the expresso range. Always bleed the steamer after steaming your milk. Clean the steamer wand with a wet paper towel and the wipe dry. Descale, descale, descale. The machine will tell you when it’s time to descale. I have this machine for 7 months, used 4-6 times a day, never fails. Don’t scrimp on the descaling solution; I use Saeco."
3460,5.0,2018-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome. Made perfect espresso and latte first try out of the box.
3461,1.0,2019-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,grinder doesn’t work
3462,5.0,2022-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes great tasting coffee in less than 2 minutes!
3463,2.0,2020-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you buy a $500 coffee machine, you would expect it to last several years. We started getting low pressure in less than 6 months. That's a terrible investment. I would suggest another brand as from other reviews, this has not been fixed or easily fixed by the company."
3464,2.0,2018-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Received my “new” Breville espresso machine with coffee grounds in the grinder and inner packaging....haven’t tested it,but disappointed with the condition based on the price I paid."
3465,5.0,2017-04-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use. Fast. About as easy to clean as a machine like this can get. Seems well built so far (5-10 cups a day for about a month.) The coffee is as good or better than you'll buy anywhere.
3466,5.0,2021-12-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Still making excellent espresso after two years
3467,5.0,2018-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this Espresso Machine, Best on the market- perfect espresso every time!"
3468,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I owned one of these for a decade before it quit producing any pressure. This one has literally zero, right out of the box. It's disturbing that there is no quality control on an item this expensive."
3469,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"But, DO CLEAN IT!!!! Mine broke bc i didn't clean it often. Other than that, it's lovely."
3470,5.0,2018-10-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it but I think it's better to have more space to use a big cup it would be much better but I fall in love with it.
3471,4.0,2019-12-04, Black Sesame,Best espresso machine for home and ofice uses
3472,4.0,2020-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes great coffee- but a little messy.
3473,5.0,2019-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"my husband loves it, it is like in the café.
not for fast people, only for real coffee lovers!
works very well, and not loud at all even for grinding coffee! we see/hear a qualited product."
3474,5.0,2020-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best espresso machine

3479,5.0,2020-01-23, Black Sesame,Love this expresso machine. Easy to use and it makes a wonderful cup of expresso.
3480,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Takes a little practice to master all its benefits, but it does every thing it claims well. Use daily and it delivers a great beverage."
3481,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee machine...excellent job with dosages and coffee grind.....
3482,1.0,2022-06-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Will be returning!!!

Got the Breville machine for a anniversary gift for my wife. One of her friends has one and she really liked it. This one showed up and looked to be used even though some of the parts looked to have never been used. I did not buy it used or refurbished either I bought and paid for new.

I have bought a lot of things from Amazon and this was the first time I have ever had any problems."
3483,5.0,2018-05-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love everything about this machine. Size, ease, expresso, foamed milk....all round great. Best purchase ever."
3484,5.0,2019-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely great machine and the price was also great. I ordered it when we were in Australia and it beat us home.
3485,5.0,2019-11-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very nice machine, worth the $."
3486,5.0,2017-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,LOVE IT! Now I know what a great latte is suppose to taste like.
3487,5.0,2019-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Fav coffee machine by far.
Makes consistently great coffee. Especially with fresh beans.
Highly recommended"
3488,5.0,2020-01-01, Black Sesame,I got this as a gift for my significant other and I must say the smiles haven't stopped.. this thing is awesome! and the espresso that it makes is so much better than the little machine we had before.
3489,4.0,2019-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very happy with the results. Good for cafezinhos to lattes to regular american coffee.
3490,1.0,2019-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Unless you are a barista or plan to go to barista college, don't do it. If you want to wake up, press a button, and have delicious espresso appear in your cup, then this is NOT the machine for you. I was shocked after all the awesome reviews that this machine was so complicated. I went with the Delonghi espresso machine that is truly a simply espresso machine that makes AMAZING espresso without having to have a degree in espresso making. https://amzn.to/2QedZT2"
3491,5.0,2019-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect cup everytime!
3492,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Honestly it’s a beautiful machine- but pulling a good shot of expresso is hard you need the perfect everything. Just not worth it
3493,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,love this coffee maker :)
3494,5.0,2018-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! So easy to use. Great quality machine
3495,1.0,2019-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have not had this item even a year and it is rusting. It is supposed to be made from stainless steel. Clearly it is not.
3496,5.0,2017-03-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worth the price!
3497,5.0,2019-11-02, Black Sesame,If you roast your own green beans....this machine is great.
3498,5.0,2018-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love our Breville! We are enjoying it a lot! Thanks!
3499,2.0,2020-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Normally I do not write a review and this one has nothing to do with the performance of the machine which is great.

The problem is rust. I am a commodity manager for the biggest food processing company and this will just happen if their was contamination of carbon steel with stainless steel which is unacceptable!!! See below picture..."
3500,5.0,2018-02-01, Black Sesame,Wonderful espresso machine once you figure out how to use. I suggest once you have used it a few times go back and re-read the manual. It will make much more sense then.
3501,5.0,2019-05-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I LOVE THIS THING. Works like a charm. It's a bit messy sometimes - grounds get all over the place. But I love it and would recommend it in a heartbeat.
3502,1.0,2019-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve head 2 off these machines and the first one worked great! There seems to be something wrong with this machine as it cannot regularly get up to the proper pressure range. Very disappointed.
3503,5.0,2017-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Sturdy, great taste from temp control (others burn the coffee)"
3504,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect coffee machine ❤️❤️❤️
3505,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this item and had to cancel as it was not delivered. Reordered and the second unit would not pressurize or heat up correctly. Settings would also not change. Tested for 3 days and wasted good coffee. The cancelled and returned unit arrived and was left outside of my commercial business after hours, luckily it was found. It also would not pressurize or heat up. It is a beautiful unit nice feature but does not work. Now I have 2 to return."
3506,1.0,2021-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel," La peor compra que he hecho, al segundo dia de haberla comprado se arruino el molino de cafe, hace un ruido fuerte y no funciona! He tratado de contactarme con servicio al cliente en Breville y nadie responde. Lo peor y es bastante costosa para arruinarse al segundo dia"
3507,2.0,2014-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Something was wrong in brewers,,
When I make espresso has to be start brewing after 5-6 secend but it came right away"
3508,1.0,2019-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Coffee comes out lukewarm with no crema.
What I tried:
I left the machine on for 20-30 minutes. I used all the different cup sizes, tried different grind amount and sizes. Different coffee, both fresh. I tried preheating the filter and cup. the cup is hot, but the coffee inside the cup is not hot at all. Oddly enough the water that comes out feels hot, but the coffee that drops out feels lukewarm, I even tried touching the coffee as it comes out of the machine, it was not hot at all.

Getting a replacement, if theres any change I will update."
3509,5.0,2019-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Just like it was advertised. Couldn’t be happier with it.
3510,5.0,2019-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,It’s a very good product
3511,3.0,2020-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,We found it to be too messy and loud.
3512,1.0,2020-02-08, Black Sesame,Do not buy Breville. Replacement parts are not available!
3513,5.0,2018-10-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have been using it for half a year. Very satisfied!
3514,5.0,2021-11-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you love espresso and like to control all the variables like grind size, amount, water quality, bean quality and pressure, this is a great machine. It's easy to use and to clean as well."
3515,2.0,2021-03-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Am not satisfied first of all with my decision and not revewing this order. However amazon is also responsible to make things more clear for its customers

I bought this machine with its tools and the most important the coffee handle and cofee beans tank

Just imagine i recived the machine with no use"
3516,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use. Reliable. Great Espresso!
3517,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use and makes amazing coffee!

3519,1.0,2019-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I ordered a new machine, not a reconditioned unit and received a very used unit. There was a lot of coffee residue on the grinder and expresso areas and two screws on the bottom were rusty. The surface showed a lot of water spotting like someone attempted to clean the unit with a wet rag."
3520,5.0,2019-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Just made an amazing latte!

3522,5.0,2019-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Perfect.
3523,1.0,2019-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,The machine is great! The water basin is poorly designed and broke after 3 weeks. We've tried to contact customer support to get a replacement for about a year now and have heard radio silence. If your's works it's excellent but there is a chance you just bought a very expensive paper weight.
3524,5.0,2016-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,I like it

 Great product but noisy"
3526,1.0,2019-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,the machine worked great for a week. Then it started making a strange noise and we can not figure it out. It is extremely loud and sounds like something is broken on the inside of the espresso machine. We have taken extra caution with it in taking care of it. I do not know what is wring with it but I do know something major is wring with it. This is why we are sending the machine back.
3527,1.0,2021-10-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE: after 13 months and expiration of warranty, machine stopped pumping water through portafilter, hence to espresso. Impossible to speak to a human at Breville USA support. Attempted 3x to request a call back from Breville and they never responded. None of the 3 espresso repair shops in San Diego will touch Breville as they are unable to obtain parts. Interesting. So yes, when they work they produce good espresso, but warning that when they break outside of the 12 month warranty, you may not be able to find anyone to repair them..."
3528,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,We use this daily and SO happy we upgraded from our $200 Breville Espresso Machine

3532,1.0,2019-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine worked well for for just over a year. Then the pressure pump supplying the water start to fail to shut off. It was cleaned countless times and also reset to factory settings. I only used bottled water in the machine. After corresponding with customer service at Breville they determined they could repair the machine for $239!

I will purchase another machine but it will not be from Breville!"

No matter how diligently the machine is maintained, as it nears its end of life, one just knows. The machine takes on a “mind” of its own, and powers on or off, will not switch off, and ultimately will not turn on. Into the trash, and never again purchase another POS (piece of $#it) from Breville. There quality is not up to par."

3550,5.0,2018-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have purchased a number of these coffee/espresso makers. This is the best value option around. I now have 3 versions of their product and would buy more when needed. Delivered on time. Very happy.
3551,5.0,2018-02-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Greatest machine ever and my brother-in-law uses it every day.
3552,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Concur with all the good reviews. Have had it for 1 month and use it 2-3 times a day. Love it
3553,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Was so excited to get our machine. Got to the point at set up where you add water and lock the tank in place. It leaked from the bottom of the machine. We spent about an hour making sure everything was locked in place correctly, etc. but the machine was faulty. Returned it. Looked at other reviews and video online of people with the same problem. Will not be buying this brand."
3554,5.0,2020-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely love it!
3555,5.0,2016-02-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,After reading the directions and using a couple of time it seems to perform beautifully. We have had no problems are enjoying the machine. I would have no problem recommending it to others.
3556,5.0,2020-02-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best barista coffee machine
3557,3.0,2019-09-22, Black Sesame,sometimes it takes a long time for the pressure to get up :-/
3558,5.0,2017-11-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine. Makes great espresso. I tried a Delonghi stainless steel machine and was awful, ended up returning it. Nothing like the Breville."
3559,5.0,2021-11-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works great no complaints
3560,5.0,2017-05-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very high quality machine and the expresso it brews. Take time to figure out the right grind and packing the coffee; it is worth the price.
3561,5.0,2018-11-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Happy with it
3562,5.0,2017-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Most definitely the best espresso machine on the market
3563,1.0,2018-03-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The pressure never worked no matter the fine or course of the grind, very messy when coming out of the grinder coffee everywhere but ultimately sent back bc the pressure never worked regardless of all that was suggested in book and online. The worst is when I called breville and they said there was a 2 hour wait to speak with support and when I left my number I never got a returned call..."
3564,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had machine for a week, and made single expresso shots and was great. Problem was when I made double shot expresso had very little pressure. I tried for hours with adjustments and nothing. Adjusted back to single and high pressure again. Wry disappointed"
3565,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Pod
3566,5.0,2018-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,The Breville makes. A very good cup of java
3567,3.0,2019-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far I have been enjoying the Breville Barista. I'm still learning how to make the perfect Latte. There is one thing I have a problem with is when I go to make my second shot the pressure is never enough.
3568,1.0,2019-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Low pressure and leaks all over within 10 months of use this is trash. Cleaned regularly and maintained. Even on the lowest grind number is giving me terrible pressure and flavor. I would like some answers from Breville
3569,5.0,2020-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Good machine, small foot print, makes great espresso, but somewhat noisy"
3570,1.0,2018-07-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this because of the high ratings (how i don't know) it received on amazon but......from the first time we used the Barista Express Espresso Machine, BES870XL it failed to build pressure and/or the gauge did not register pressure. There is something seriously wrong when you spend $500 and the darn thing is broken before you even get it out of the box. Btw, there are many complaints about this very problem."
3571,5.0,2020-01-13, Black Sesame,Great machine makes wonderful espresso and has everything you need
3572,5.0,2020-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Still getting used to the mechanics of it but I really do enjoy it! We have made various hot, iced, and blended espresso drinks and they all came out great!"
3573,5.0,2020-03-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excelente
3574,1.0,2015-05-08, Black Sesame,"CHEAPLY MADE. LOT OF PLASTIC. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS ONE. THE STEAM WOND SHOOTS OUT WATER AND ""SOME"" STEAM"". I'LL BE RETURNING."
3575,2.0,2020-10-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Grinder stopped working after 4 months of use. Contacted Breville customer service, it will be about 1 month before the repairs are complete and I get my machine back. Very disappointed for spending $500 and having espresso machine fail in 4 months."
3576,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Envio rapido, buen equipo para casa"
3577,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Alittle concerned that it was made in Chna, but have to say its makes the best Cafe-Cappuccino I have had since being in Italy..."
3578,5.0,2016-08-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,best cappuccino ever
3579,5.0,2017-11-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely amazing and looks so great!!! I love it!!! Did take a bit of trying to get the shot right but it's great now and steams the milk beautifully!

3582,5.0,2019-10-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Can't start the day without a good coffee. This system can make all the different options of coffee
3583,5.0,2017-11-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,We are so happy with Breville BES870XL. We found a good deal at Amazon. We start our day with cap of cappuccino ☕️👍🏻😋. Highly recommended.
3584,5.0,2019-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,bought it for my brother. he has been using it for months and no problem at all. great product.
3585,5.0,2018-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far this machine is a home run. It has everything I was looking for, from fast heating, to the built in grinder, I am one hundred percent satisfied."
3586,5.0,2020-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent Product
3587,5.0,2018-05-06, Black Sesame,This is the best machine I have had the pleasure of using with the exception of commercial machines. There really is nothing that I don't like about it so far (after 2 months).
3588,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it!!!
3589,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product. Though expect a bit of a mess.

3591,5.0,2020-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee
3592,5.0,2022-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Once you figure out your grind size and the right pressure you will get the best coffee ever!
3593,5.0,2019-11-09, Black Sesame,Amazing machine! Serious coffee makers will love it.
3594,5.0,2019-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a really great product.It is easy to maintain. Priced right and Looks great.
3595,5.0,2020-02-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Just as described
3596,5.0,2017-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing product.
3597,5.0,2020-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it. Easy to dial in the settings you want for grind and extraction. Tamping takes practice but thats the operator not the machine. I'd buy it again.
3598,5.0,2020-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very good
3599,5.0,2019-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"100% excellent machine, requires maintenance but worth it."
3600,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have to say if the machine was still working I would have given it 5 stars. BUT problems had started after one year, now the machine started buzzing, not dispensing shots, then the steamer not working, now dead! We also clean the machine on a regular basis. When it was working, it ground coffee to perfection, beautiful creme on the shots. It's just a shame that when spending so much money for a product that appears to have quality, that it turned out to be junk!"
3601,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Nice machine
3602,5.0,2019-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband loves this Coffee maker
3603,5.0,2017-12-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent Machine!
3604,1.0,2018-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are going to pay $700 for something you would expect to last longer than 18 months, which this machine did not. I have attempted to contact Breville but so far no call back, as they have extremely high call volumes, which I assume means I am not the only having issues with their products."
3605,5.0,2017-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Everything the sellers said it was. Love it
3606,5.0,2019-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,it's amazing. Easy to use. Excellent coffee
3607,5.0,2018-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great work, fast & super easy to clean"
3608,2.0,2019-11-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this on Nov 2019. It works quite good. But when I clean it today and found one screw rusty. I don’t understand why its happened. I think all staffs should be stainless.
3609,5.0,2019-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"easy to make espresso, fancy design~ I'm really satisfied with it
Except that thermocoil heater for water makes the grinder part warm, it is the best choice for the reasonable price."
3610,5.0,2016-12-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Only had it a week, works perfectly, great espresso"
3611,5.0,2019-10-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love it!

3621,5.0,2016-11-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing and works great!!
3622,3.0,2020-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,My wife returned it ; I'm sure it's good ; too much hands on for her
3623,1.0,2013-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Can't believe it. The steam wand no longer works at all (about a year after buying it), on this one or the other one I bought from Breville (800ESXL). What's up with that??? Why would the steam wand just suddenly stop working on two units from the same company, and different machines? Maybe they use some sort of weaker steam system or something. I'd love if Breville reached out to me about this, as I have had a lot of trouble figuring out how to get in touch with their customer support."
3624,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso machine. It's worth the extra $$ over the other entry level machines.
3625,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Absolutely love this machine! Amazing coffee every morning :)
3626,5.0,2019-12-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a very well-manufactured machine, easy to follow instructions for the novice barista, makes great espresso"
3627,3.0,2019-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Returned it. Was not getting consistent espresso pours.
3628,5.0,2018-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this coffee machine the espresso taste amazing!!!
3629,5.0,2016-05-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Works nicely, looked more complicated than it was."
3630,1.0,2021-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Coffee everywhere in the package and the machine. Disappointed.
3631,1.0,2019-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,I need help with my Breville. It is on the brink.
3632,5.0,2018-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it!!
3633,5.0,2018-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,More than 3 years and still working every day
3634,5.0,2021-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great coffee maker. Little difficult to learn to use but customer support was great help.
3635,5.0,2020-03-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,AWESOME MACHINE
3636,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far I love it! It's been a wonder!
3637,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good
3638,2.0,2017-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,First time using it I had trouble get the water to pump. Two months later and the pressure gauge isn’t working. Makes a good cup of coffee but for the price I expect better reliability.
3639,5.0,2019-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Outstanding espresso. Practiced and adjusted a few times and now it's perfect every time. Have no problem with beans getting stuck so far.
3640,5.0,2020-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,👍
3641,5.0,2019-08-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it
3642,5.0,2020-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Once you get the settings right this machine is amazing! the espresso comes out at the perfect temperature and as long as you are using quality coffee tastes great!
3643,5.0,2020-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am pleased with the Breville Espresso machine. Using the dual wall filter took most of the skill requirements out of the equation for getting a consistent brew.
3644,5.0,2019-09-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really great! My husband and me both love it, and we enjoy two Latte at home everyday now, the taste is better than Starbucks."
3645,5.0,2019-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband. Although it took some getting used to, now he loves it."
3646,5.0,2021-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,It takes a bit to fine tune to your liking but hands down best cup of coffee I ever had.
3647,1.0,2022-01-06, Black Sesame,The aesthetics of this espresso machine is exceptional! I love the included tamper and the grinder. I love everything about it until last week when the steam wand stopped working. It no longer produces steam making my espresso machine useless. I’m very disappointed that a product like this is expensive and broke down on me 2 years after I purchased it. Breville only has a 1 year limited warranty. I will never buy a Breville again.
3648,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The espresso machine has to defect and took me several hours before I find a way to identify the fault. When I saw Youtube video to identify the possible issues I was able to trace it out. Then I was thinking why not the product's FAQ section didn't cover this issue.

I bought a second and working great so far."
3649,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchase this 5 years ago. No need to leave early to hit the local coffee shop or starbucks for an espresso or latte. Have one every morning for 5 years. Saved estimated $9,000 to $20,000 on espresso. It is still (knock on wood) churning them out. I get it my way with better coffee beans than starbucks. But you can use their beans, too."
3650,5.0,2019-09-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good.
3651,5.0,2019-05-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Five Star home espresso !!
3652,5.0,2018-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,👍👍
3653,5.0,2016-12-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great and easy to use espresso machine for novices. Would recommend!
3654,1.0,2020-02-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"What I like:
- hot water nozzle
- foam wand
- espresso

What doesn't work well:
- The grinder clicks and makes a loud noise
- The machine smells like something is burning
- The machine makes smoke
- I called Breville and was on hold for 40+ minutes and nobody ever answered or returned my call

I now have a $500+ espresso machine that doesn't grind coffee...."
3655,5.0,2020-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine in February of 2016 after getting tired of spending money buying lattes. It's now been six years and I only have a few complaints about the machine. First is that the dual shot grind setting dispenses too much even on the lowest setting. The second is that grinds fall into the water tray causing it to get nasty and require frequent cleaning.

Other than that, this espresso maker hasn't needed anything but some cleaning in the six years I've owned it. I pull consistent shots without any additional gadgets or special techniques. I pull at least a double shot from it every day, usually more. Buy some quality flavorings and you can make anything your local coffee shop makes, minus the $6 price tag and waiting in line!

I would recommend this to anyone looking for an all in one espresso machine that's easy to use and reliable."
3656,1.0,2019-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very much disappointed.
Don't buy it. Internally this expensive machine is built with plastic made main gears, believe me, with plastic!!
And, you will not see parts to replace it in the market, or at technical assistance.
Mine prepared 10 small coffees until get broken.

The grinder is not working.

I purchased this coffee machine here at Amazon and brought it to my use in Brazil. Breville warranties not cover technical assistance out side of USA. - I waste my time and my money with this Brand."
3657,5.0,2015-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this for my Wife. She is very happy with it. Works great.
3658,5.0,2019-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,I Got B Barista for my boyfriend. He loves it and so I'm I. I defenetly recommend this product.

3660,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love love love this machine. Takes a little practice but the espresso is to die for. Looks great too.

3662,5.0,2020-01-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,so far a great and easy to use machine. love my espressos.
3663,5.0,2020-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,excellent product very easy to use very useful when it comes to the holidays I highly recommend it if you are not skilled in the preparation of coffe
3664,5.0,2019-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,the best of the best
3665,1.0,2017-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This has to be the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. This thing is crap. $555 should produce at least a semi-consistent espresso. I've only used two different beans. No, I'm not an espresso aficionado, but I expected more from Breville."
3666,5.0,2020-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great product
3667,5.0,2016-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,this is my love and joy every morning
3668,1.0,2019-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I cannot get someone to help me fix my machine problem. The grinder is not working properly. Even though I have a case number {R101499939) nobody has follow up with it. For the amount of money that was paid for it, I expect a lot more from Breville. Very frustrating!!!!!!!!!"
3669,3.0,2017-06-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"works very well, I think that was a good buy but not a great buy, the water tank is a very fragile plastic, gives the impression that break at any time or with minimal touch."
3670,2.0,2016-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine lasted about three months after the warranty expired. It looks like the solenoid valve doesn't hold up, and now it's impossible to find online and replace. I would expect a 600 dollar espresso machine to last longer than 15 months."
3671,5.0,2018-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great espresso, easy to use, easy to clean."
3672,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,The double shot part doesn’t work anymore and it’s doing random things
3673,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"You can't go wrong with a Breville product, and this Barista Express Espresso Machine is no different. It looks great, operates with ease and delivers excellent espresso."
3674,5.0,2018-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best all in one barista toy. Great for trying out diferent beans and grinds. I've never drink so much coffee in my life untill I bought this espresso machine.
3675,5.0,2016-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it so much.
3676,5.0,2016-06-23, Black Sesame,We have had it for 2 years. Works like new.
3677,5.0,2019-07-29, Black Sesame,"This unit is expensive, but I don't regret the purchase. It does make great coffee."
3678,1.0,2019-10-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,What a disaster! This machine is difficult to use in my experience. Trying to contact customer service and getting some help has been impossible. I’ve had issues with getting in the water hot enough. Sometimes it makes coffee and sometimes it doesn’t. 600 bucks down the drain. Save yourself the aggravation and just go to the coffee House.
3679,5.0,2018-11-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worth every penny.
3680,3.0,2014-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"While this machine is easy to use and brews strong flavor, regardless of the coffee or blend every time it causes an upset tummy."
3681,5.0,2017-12-17, Black Sesame,"This machine makes the best espresso, lattes and cappuccino you can imagine!
Easy to operate and very fast.
The on-board burr grinder is a very big plus!"
3682,5.0,2017-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,It's a perfect gift for a coffee/espresso lover!
3683,5.0,2019-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Freaking love this thing. Save me $4/day from Starbuck and taste the same (Capurccino/Expresso). Hope this last along time as this thing is expensive
3684,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this machine back in Mar. 2014 and it has worked well since then. I did a short review video on Youtube: http://youtu.be/oFChUn60Td8

3690,1.0,2018-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There are some shortfallswith this machine. The steaming wand has a limited reach and steam pressure is limited. I have had the steam stop while steaming milk. The other problem is the filter baskets get stuck and don't come out with the portafilter. Lastly, I have been using this daily for 2 months and the pump started making an odd noise and now aferocious under 5 mon the ofirst moder ate use, the pump failed and doesn't develop adequate pressure. I am returning it for service or replacement. Has anyone else had similar problems?

3694,3.0,2019-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,The grinder is a luck if operates . Makes ok coffee . Better stay off it and get grinder and espresso separately . Not a huge fan .
3695,5.0,2019-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes such good cappuccinos and espressos that I don't even like going to coffee shops anymore!
3696,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,So far so good! Makes an amazing expresso! Iced or hot! Better than expected!
3697,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Use it every day and I love this machine. I just make espresso but my wife makes Lattes and loves it as well. It just works.
3698,1.0,2020-10-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,I was so excited to begin using this machine and as I opened I could smell coffee. How funny that I paid full price for something that was previously used... RETURNED NOW.
3699,5.0,2019-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Thank you Breville for a perfect espresso!
3700,1.0,2019-07-28, Black Sesame,"It worked very well for 2 months. Freshly ground coffee extracted great, you can control the grind, time of extraction and even the temperature. Now only the grinder is working but the expresso machine is making a buzzing noise and no reading on the pressure gauge. I have used a DeLonghi EC702 for 5 year before it gave any issue. I have taken good care of this machine cleaned out after every extraction and maintained it. This is too short a life span."
3701,4.0,2020-09-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,My wife love coffee machines.
3702,5.0,2018-08-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works great.
3703,1.0,2019-02-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After 1 year of use I am having issues with the machine producing excess coffee which is diluted.

After contacting customer service they are not getting back to me.

Very dissatisfied with my $500 purchase."
3704,5.0,2019-11-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,love it!
3705,1.0,2020-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,We've had this machine for a year and a half and of course the warranty is only a year and it's not working. So frustrating to spend so much money on a freaking coffee machine to only have it last 1.5yrs. Buy the extra warranty if their is one. Otherwise you may be out $600.
3706,1.0,2017-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This item arrived missing critical items, the steel milk frother and the whole bean dispenser, and the lid. It was also scratched in three places on the front. While Breville offered to ship the missing items or replace the machine, due to the considerable shipping time, I decided to fully return it."
3707,5.0,2016-07-28, Black Sesame,What a great machine... best espressos ever.
3708,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Setting up the machine is fairly easy. Realizing it doesn't work properly and then having to re-pack it and ship it back....not so much.

How does a company not test it’s products thoroughly before shipping it? The cost to everyone is quite high. Test your products."
3709,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love! Love! Love! I can not live without this Breville 870.
I feel like I am a barista! You can make a great coffee."
3710,1.0,2019-04-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worked fine for 1 year and 4 months.
Now almost all water that should be going into the portafilter goes into the drip tray.
NO PARTS! NO SERVICE! B.S. Company!"
3711,5.0,2020-01-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best non commercial unit available..had 1 year and no problems..grounder settings the same as commercial systems.
Semi auto cleaning is great...no complaints..
Great machine"
3712,5.0,2017-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great device
3713,5.0,2015-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've only just gotten it, but it looks like it's going to be a good purchase. I got the extended warranty just incase."
3714,1.0,2018-03-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I read many reviews prior to purchasing this unit. Most were 5 stars, which is why I selected this unit. However, mine leaked all over my counter the first time I filled it with water and turned it on. Tech support's best solution was to return it. Lots of hassle and wasted time. I do not recommend this espresso machine."
3715,1.0,2019-12-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Already broken. We have used this MAYBE ten times. Woke up this morning and my husbands go to make our usual morning espresso. It makes his and then he goes to grind mine and it doesn't grind!

He cleans it completely. Very Detailed like her does after ever use.. tries again a few hours later and still NOTHING. I'm literally crying because I spent so much money on this thing hoping it was good quality and lasts less than a month."
3716,5.0,2017-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this coffee maker, awesome purchase."
3717,1.0,2018-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just received a DIRTY, USED Breville Barista Expresso Machine! I paid OVER $500 for a what was described BRAND NEW machine. It literally still had coffee grounds in the grinder, water spots, and ANIMAL HAIR on it!! Disgusting! I was giving this as a gift for my husband & he opened up a DIRTY used machine! I’m furious & embarrassed. WTF!?!?"
3718,5.0,2020-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,working great. makes good lattes. using the double wall with #8 grind and using manual purge.
3719,5.0,2019-12-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works Great!
3720,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is my new best friend.
3721,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes some great espresso
3722,1.0,2019-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The portafilter that you attach the pod of coffee is getting harder and harder to screw on. It is almost impossible to attach it to the machine to make expresso. You need to wrestle it on!
I also noticed it has a crack in the plastic. Very disappointing for an expensive item!"
3723,5.0,2018-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this for the office. Use it everyday. Love it!
3724,5.0,2015-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this products!!! Easy to make great espresso
3725,5.0,2019-04-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"have it for over one year, flawless. Love it"
3726,5.0,2016-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent expresso maker. The machine is very easy to set up and use. The freshly ground coffee makes a big difference in the coffee taste.
3727,5.0,2020-10-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is incredible!
3728,1.0,2019-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought two of the BES870XL in 2017 for my personal use, one in March and one in September. The grinder broke on the first one after six months. Customer service processed and fixed, now working fine. I could not get the second machine get to target pressure and brew properly. Overall, when the product is working the machine makes great espresso. Relaiblility and predictablilty is the concern."
3729,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Worked well for about three weeks and then the coffee grinder just stopped working. I went through several rounds of cumbersome cleaning process but this thing will not come back to life. It made good coffee while it worked. It’s fun to test ones barista skills with the single wall filters.
3730,5.0,2019-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, makles great espresso"
3731,5.0,2019-07-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this a year ago and it still works well! We got this on sale so great buy, too!"
3732,1.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,So excited when I ordered this. Unfortunately when it arrived the temperature gauge was broke. Now I have to waste my time to return a item that was sent to be broken.
3733,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,High quality machine. Works perfectly!
3734,5.0,2015-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just Lovely, Makes my day everyday."

3736,5.0,2013-11-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,wonderful machine
3737,5.0,2020-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine. Wish it could take a regular size tall mug. Delivery was fast and it was new and nice and everything was in the box.
3738,5.0,2019-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great as expected. The manual could be more descriptive on Pressure control.
3739,2.0,2019-08-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I got this mechanic as used. Please check before you opened the box.
3740,5.0,2020-03-09, Black Sesame,Love it! No more trips to Starbucks in the morning :D
3741,3.0,2015-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Sold mine after 2 years of use. I recommend not to use spring water or water with lots of minerals. It's so hard to clean the machine afterwards. My complaints were it's hard to dial in with barista express, too many inconsistent shots, grinder is not consistent as well. There is also channeling issue, I had to use puck screen to overcome the issue. Single shots tasted terrible, so I always did double shots 1:2 ratio."
3742,1.0,2019-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"machine gets hot to the touch, smells bad, almost like it was going to melt down and catch the house on fire. sent back... would never buy used again from ""warehouse"" with ""small cosmetic damage""... there was no damage, it was just a piece of crap.someone returned then they sold.to.me!"
3743,2.0,2015-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Grinder is nice but you lose a lot of grind in the process. Xpresso is so-so, this is after 5 weeks of experimentation. I've had better machines and conculded I could've spent more money and would have been more satisfied."
3744,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome machine! I couldn't be more pleased!
3745,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,used everyday for 2 years. love it
3746,5.0,2021-10-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing Machine
3747,1.0,2020-03-08, Black Sesame,I returned this item due to a cheaper price elsewhere.
3748,5.0,2019-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Exceptionally good espresso maker. Easy to use-semi automated. Great quality.
3749,5.0,2020-11-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is the best balance between affordability and quality.
3750,5.0,2019-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,i love it easy to wok and easy to keep clean. I use it everyday
3751,1.0,2019-04-24, Black Sesame,"Unreliable. Broke down in less than 8 months of regular use (average 2 coffees daily) Those were the most expensive cups of coffee I ever had taking into account the cost of the machine. The warranty service is in progress, but it takes for ever (they are in no hurry) and for the 2-3 weeks minimum I expect to be without a machine, I had to buy a Nespresso. This is costing me way too much! It's been an expensive mistake"
3752,5.0,2020-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it! Took a few tries to get a good pour. But now it is great.
3753,5.0,2017-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espress maker for the money there is nothing better
3754,5.0,2020-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"what a great machine better than going to a coffee shop and taste better then a coffee shop, easy to use and a much appreciated gift."
3755,5.0,2019-11-11, Black Sesame,Love it; the coffee is great and so easy to use.
3756,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Coffee doesn’t come out hot.
3757,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I took excellent care of this machine. After two years...it won't power on. That's a lot of money to spend on something that won't last. I was hoping to get at least three more years out of it.
3758,5.0,2020-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best coffee ever. Very happy with this espresso maker.
3759,5.0,2018-02-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,great machine use it every day

3762,5.0,2018-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best of the Best!!
3763,2.0,2020-04-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine broke down after a few months. Breville customer service is a pain in the rear end. sent it back and it got ""repaired."" Now the pressure does not work properly anymore... Expensive product, but not backed up by quality. Do not buy."
3764,1.0,2021-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"basically the machine was good and everything seems fine after a second coffee shot the machine stoped and vapored from inside and i was surprised , and now is not working.
i followed all the instructions and rules

3768,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine. Well made. Beautiful design. Makes super expresso. Easy to maintain and fun to use.
3769,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I thought that I would love this machine, but I can’t. The steamer pump stopped working almost immediately - within days.

Too bad, it had potential. I moved onto a Gaggia. So far so good. But still too early to know.

On the bright side, the return was not hard."
3770,5.0,2015-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine is awesome. Makes a great expresso every time. Clean up is so easy. . Highly recommend this well built product.
3771,1.0,2018-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this unit and first day the unit would not rise to express pressure. Returned and replaced with duplicate machine. Used dozen times. Five months later new unit carries no pressure. Junk. No wonder the warrantee is 30 days.
3772,5.0,2019-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent machine - love it!
3773,1.0,2014-08-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It worked well initially but a few months in, the coarse setting selector broke.
I reached out to their support and no helpful reply after a week."
3774,5.0,2020-06-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine
3775,5.0,2013-07-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this Espresso machine! Works beautifully! Thank you!
3776,5.0,2020-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use. Easy to clean. Enjoying espresso everyday.
3777,4.0,2017-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The milk frother is very disappointing - it may be broken or defective. (1) It is VERY LOUD ... actually hurts the ears and no ability to communicate with others within 15 feet of the machine while frother is activated. (2) Essentially zero milk foam after dozens of attempts using the recommended techniques, (3) overheats the milk yet little to no foam."
3778,5.0,2020-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great espresso machine!!!
3779,5.0,2016-10-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,It's awesome better than Starbucks saved 50 dollars a week
3780,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this machine and received a defective grinder. Returned and went ahead and ordered the same machine without the grinder. I read reviews of people saying their grinders stopped working after only two months. Did not want to go through that. Hope this machine lasts me because it is pretty spendy.
3781,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,After one year the machine became very inconsistent and the steam wand lost half its power. Very disappointing for the price.
3782,3.0,2018-07-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The information states that this comes with everything you need to get started, this isn't true. There isn't anything included to actually catch the espresso."
3783,5.0,2019-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best you unit for the money yet. The coffee is fresh each time with the air tight grinder. The steamer works great.
3784,5.0,2019-11-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best coffee machine I had
3785,5.0,2017-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very easy to use, perfect with a good coffee grain."

3792,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,quality machine
3793,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The grinder never worked.
Adjusted the grinder to the finest setting on both parts and the grounds still don't come fine enough for espresso. It has been impossible to pull a shot as its not possible to achieve any pressure."
3794,5.0,2018-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it. Use it everyday. No issues so far.
3795,2.0,2016-12-18, Black Sesame,Pictures speak louder than words. This was a warehouse item. No insulation and error on constantly.
3796,1.0,2018-11-06, Black Sesame,There wast no filter Included with my purchase. I dont know if this product is used or something but the charcoal filter is not here. Now I have to order filters.

3798,1.0,2021-10-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Make GREAT EXPRESSO with excellent crema, but the Quality of the machine is very poor (inside).

I bought this Machine because of the almost 5 Stars Review, but very disappointed that it lasted 1 day, No pressure showed up the second day.

After making some more research I found many more similar cases, seems that the quality is not what we expected. But why is it rated almost 5 STARS ?"
3799,4.0,2021-11-01, Black Sesame,Good!

3809,1.0,2019-11-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Terrible! Item came obviously used and abused with all small parts missing!
3810,5.0,2020-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is very user friendly. Love everything about it, nice to make my own. Happy birthday to me."
3811,2.0,2018-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Constantly needing to fill with water. You need to Prime the hot water every time you turn it on to get semi hot coffee. a lot of wasted water.
3812,1.0,2013-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this to use the double shot filter .... I don't like the taste of the coffee with the pressurized filters and cannot get the double shot filter to pull at the correct pressure no matter how I change the grind/amount or amount of strength I use to tamp the grounds. I should have stuck to buying appliances from Costco ... because returns for defective items on amazon are difficult and shipping is outrageous
3813,5.0,2016-09-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's our second one, got fair use out of the first one."
3814,5.0,2019-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a quality machine for the $$. It's heavy and well made. Very happy with it so far.
3815,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best Best Best!!!
Drinking coffee using that machine is like going to Starbucks. :D"
3816,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really liked the quality of the espresso, although I must say that it wasn't always consistent. However, today the grinder is not working. I did an in-depth cleaning and followed all the troubleshooting techniques I could find, to no avail. Six months is all that I got from this machine."
3817,3.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Never got to use it. It's fairly tall and wouldn't fit under our kitchen cabinets.
3818,5.0,2020-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,An awesome and easy to use machine! Good Bye expensive $5 cup of cup and standing line at coffee shops!
3819,3.0,2020-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,grinder broke after 1 month
3820,5.0,2019-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine - easy to use and great value compared to all the other machines on the market in my opinion.
3821,5.0,2013-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,The taste of espresso is generally correlated to the price of machine. This machine is better than the price.
3822,5.0,2019-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve read the bad reviews of people having their machines breaking down from 6mo-3yrs, so hopefully mine can still keep going after a long time lol
But on a real note, my hubby and I absolutely love our machine! :)"
3823,5.0,2020-01-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It is incredibly easier to make cappuccinos than I thought it would be.

Definitely a great purchase."
3824,5.0,2018-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine, it""s what I expected. Very happy with it"
3825,1.0,2020-12-03, Black Sesame,First time out of the box & it didn't even work once. The grinder is broken. Now I have cases of espresso supplies left over & the guests were so disappointed.
3826,1.0,2016-10-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,I received this item and it’s cracked in the back. The water is coming out from the bottom of the machine and going all over the counters. There was a piece of plastic that fell out from the machine.
3827,5.0,2019-10-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my Breville! I've had it over 2 years, and 0 issues. It is used daily in our home!"
3828,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"really wish they had a straight to the point YouTube video on the basics, grind size, cleaning etc. I should not have to look through a 73pg manual. what year r we in 99'. I should not have to look at Youtubers on how to, n get 10 diff answers"
3829,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Waste of money. It’s easier to make espresso in a $30 machine. Save your money. I wish I could send this back but one of my employees set it up before I realized how complicated it is. I’m really upset with the performance of this machine.
3830,1.0,2015-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine worked fine for less than a year to me. Apparently there is one part inside that is problematic. The breville USA will try to do anything to void the warranty, as they did in my case. They told me i can send it for repair for $240 flat fee, which is really not worth it. I wouldn't recommend this product. This money you will be spending to buy it is only the begging."
3831,1.0,2019-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Unfortunately service never followed up, waited on hold forever and they followed up via email then never responded when I tried to get help. Very sad, because otherwise I like Breville."
3832,5.0,2020-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After 2 years of using one at home, bought one for the office too :)"
3833,5.0,2019-03-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine!
3834,5.0,2018-11-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have had this for a year now and just love it. No trouble and easy to operate.
3835,5.0,2019-09-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,My day start enjoying a great cup of coffee.Nothing come close to Breville/Barista quality and aroma.
3836,3.0,2019-12-12, Black Sesame,The steam frothier does not work very good but the espresso is good. If you like cappuccino I would get something else.
3837,2.0,2019-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Well designed BUT:

1. A lot of pretend aluminum or steel. Most is plastic.

3842,2.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Machine works but it’s not worth more than 150 to 200 bucks
3843,5.0,2018-03-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fantastic machine. Couldn't be happier.
3844,5.0,2019-12-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Exceeds performance of even larger &more complex machines I've owned. I thought the user's manuall was very disorganized with poor index
3845,2.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Grinder stopped working after one week. Very poor design. Get the model without the grinder and safe yourself some $)
3846,5.0,2019-12-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,I finally found an espresso machine that makes consistently great tasting espresso and steamed milk for latte's etc.
3847,1.0,2020-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Not sure what beans I am supposed to use in an espresso machine, but apparently oily espresso beans give this machine trouble. They clog up the grinder and nothing comes out. This is the 2nd unit I have tried in as many days.

Not thrilled with such a highly touted brand (and not the cheapest unit on the block).
Save your money and time.

Guess it's back to boil and roast for me."
3848,1.0,2019-03-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Honestly this was OK at first but then the coffee never tasted good and stopped working as it did before. Had it one month and sending it back, not worth the money and Man! did I want this machine to work for me"

3860,5.0,2020-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had the Breville Express 870 for 7 years. 5 of 6 of my family members are daily espresso drinkers. This machine has run thousands of pulls and has never let me down. Think of what 10,000 espresso shots at Starbucks would cost.

Regular cleaning and maintenance are key.
If it broke tomorrow, I’d be happy with the purchase and buy another. Enjoy."
3861,1.0,2020-09-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,Did not work correctly. Sent it back 14 days ago and still have not received a refund

3875,1.0,2019-12-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 The pressure gauge has stopped working in just 3 weeks of use. After reading reviews, this issue seems to be very common and is due to solenoid valve failing, which Breville offers to repair for around $200"
3876,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very good espresso mashine folow manual book to learn how to make the best espresso(grid& pressure)

3882,1.0,2017-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Grinder stopped properly working in just 1 year. It does sometimes switch on, but then it does not stop grinding, so i need to power off machine. Looks like motherboard issue. Too expensive machine for just 1 year use. Will not recommend buying it."
3883,1.0,2019-07-04, Black Sesame,"I did not receive a good one, l have to return it, this part doesn’t have to look like in the pictures I post, so mad l have to wait for the replacement, l hope the replacement come good"
3884,1.0,2018-02-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,The machine broke up after couple of years even though we don’t heavily use it. The worst part was breville support ! We have been sending emails for a couple of weeks and getting generic support answers. Save your self the money and buy another brand
3885,5.0,2014-02-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,The absolute best product I have ever purchased through the internet! It is an incredible value and a fabulous machine.

3896,5.0,2020-08-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"set up yesterday and made first cup , very good"
3897,4.0,2019-12-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been using this product for almost 3 years, and I have had great experience with it. I bought different accessories to make my daily morning routine of extracting espresso pretty great.

However, I have been having issues lately with the silicone gasket on the showerhead. I wasn't getting a good seal, due to ""cracks"" and ""splits"" in the silicone. The fault caused the pressure to leak when the puck was loaded to the showerhead. I am unhappy every morning, not having my espresso as soon as I wake up.

I contacted Breville customer service many times, and they have been great sending the silicone gasket whenever I needed it replaced. However, as of writing this, the silicone failed twice within the last month (still broken), total 4 failures in the past year. It was explained to me that the gasket should last minimum 1 year. It was a concern at one point that I was asked to send the machine in for them to take a look for free. All they did was replace the silicone, as I would have, and provide me with a new showerhead plate. They sent it back and the machine worked for 1 month, before the silicone ""cracked"" again. I contacted them again, and they said this becoming a known issue. They have elevated the concerns of silicone failures to their superiors, who have not yet replied to the issue.

Since, it takes around 7-10 standard business days for the shipping to arrive, I have been going through the unfortunate experience of caffeine detox, intermittently. I am still waiting for the part to arrive, while dreading when the replacement will ""crack"" again after minimum use.

I hope they solve this ongoing issue soon, so that their espresso machines mirror the great customer service the company has. Until then, I think I am ready to try some other espresso machines."
3898,1.0,2014-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Too bad , I saw a lot of publicity for this coffee machine. But when I arrived, Amali was greatly disappointed. As the device does not work as required, knowing that the device that I have used. So I recommend you choose another coffee machine"
3899,5.0,2022-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,LOVE THIS!!!
3900,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,gorgeous
3901,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very disappointed. Machine ran great for a long time and then died almost exactly 2 years to the day after purchasing. Far too much money spent to last only 2 years. Upset, will not buy again."
3902,5.0,2019-08-20, Black Sesame,Might be the best thing I have ever bought. Way better than my old super-automatic.
3903,1.0,2019-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased this machine June of 2017 and it stopped working last week, Jan 10/2018. This machine only made 2 espressos per day, nothing more nothing less, and only lasted 7 months. Would I purchase another product from this manufacturer? No!"
3904,5.0,2021-10-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine! So easy to make great espresso and capuchinno.
3905,1.0,2019-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,If you like the taste of burnt coffee you will love this.

3913,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love it even if limited steam power
3914,1.0,2018-05-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Item got very loud and steamer pressure decreased in six months. One push grind stopped working. You have to stand there and keep pushing the grinder to get the amount that you want. Not worth the money
3915,5.0,2018-08-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,very good
3916,1.0,2018-09-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Got brand new product today. It took 30min to setup and when started it was leaking. Now I need to pack it and return. After spending this much you expect it would work.
3917,5.0,2018-05-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Owned it for more than 3 years, used it almost every day to make 2-6 cups since, never broke once. It was a little expensive for me but now I think it worths every penny. It makes better coffee than Starbucks, makes good milk foam for latte art(still learning it). Easy to clean too, I simply throw the trays into dish washer. One of the best purchases I’ve made."
3918,1.0,2018-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After 8 months the machine lost its pressure and i no longer can have espresso. I tried to solve the issue with the indications in the Users manual and adjusting the machine but it was not possible. Costumer Service does not exist, neither does the warranty. Hope this helps other potential costumers."
3919,5.0,2017-02-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love it... Very good quality and the cafe lattes are the best.
3920,5.0,2019-10-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing. Closest thing to the real espresso we had while in Italy.
3921,1.0,2019-06-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought 2 Breville Machines & accessories.
All broke within warranty time but denied by Amazon.
Spent over $1,200.00"
3922,1.0,2020-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Doesn’t worth money.
3923,1.0,2017-09-14, Black Sesame,"Do not buy this product. 2 months In and already starting to fail. I’ve cleaned it weekly and taken great care of it, still has issues and of course now can’t return or even exchange. Don’t buy."
3924,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It started out great, but after a month of use the frother has lost most of it's use. We are disappointed."
3925,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes really good shot of espresso. It is my new favorite toy.
3926,5.0,2014-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Beautiful machine, takes time to work out the balance of grind, tamping, and water volume."

3930,1.0,2018-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought this in advance for my wife's birthday. Doesnt work out of the box and we are outside the return window. Complete waste of $700.

3937,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My machine came in today and it wouldn't produce pressure. I followed the instructions explicitly, but the machine was a dud. It was frustrating, messy, and time consuming. I would not advise buying this expensive machine"
3938,1.0,2017-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,It arrived open and with ground coffee in the plastic bag that it came in and the filters were not complete. Like someone else have opened and returned. Went back without even trying it.
3939,5.0,2019-10-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great Machine. No one button drinks but that's just less to go wrong.
3940,1.0,2018-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We loved this machine. It was easy to use. Seemed durable , like our Breville kettle. Coffee tasted great.

The first sign of problems was the steam wand stopped by itself intermittently. 2 weeks later the pressure disappeared and coffee was awful.

Just outside of the return window, which means we have to suffer through customer service."
3941,5.0,2018-08-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fantastic investment whose ROI was quickly recouped.
3942,1.0,2017-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just got my breville in the mail today and as soon as we put water in it, it started leaking everywhere! I’m so disappointed... I’ve waited a long time to purchase this. I’m not impressed."
3943,5.0,2021-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,It's a delight. I don't know how I lived without it.
3944,5.0,2013-10-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far, going six months, great options and performance both morning and night."
3945,3.0,2017-10-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is one messy operation! The coffee taste wonderful, though."
3946,5.0,2017-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,It is such a great product.
3947,5.0,2019-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,great
3948,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was purchased as a gift for my son and daughter-in-law. As far as I can tell, it worked fine for about two months. Then it went TOTALLY SOUTH AND IT HAS BEEN NON-OPERATIONAL FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS.

Not a coffee drinker, but I will NEVER BUY A BREVILLE FROM ANYONE--AND ESPECIALLY NOT FROM AMAZON"
3949,2.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,could not get it to steam correctly
3950,5.0,2016-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very good!
3951,5.0,2019-08-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,AWSOME!!! WE LOVE IT!!
3952,1.0,2019-08-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,I received the item today and water tank is cracked ... quality isn’t that good or wasn’t properly. Please breville need replacement on the water tank
3953,5.0,2019-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,the quick instruction misses a few steps
3954,5.0,2018-02-26, Black Sesame,"Love this machine, a great buy for home use!"
3955,5.0,2019-08-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,As expected.
3956,5.0,2019-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought one of these for my wife for our anniversary 3 years ago and I have probably put close to 3,000 shots through it since then. It's still doing an amazing job and making some of the best coffee I've ever had. God forbid there's a fire at my house, once I make sure that family and pets make it out, I'm going back in for this. Worth every penny."
3957,5.0,2018-03-08, Black Sesame,"works great, is convenient and space saving... all in one."
3958,5.0,2018-11-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love it, I use it every day."
3959,5.0,2021-06-18, Black Sesame,"I don’t normally review products. But when Amazon advertised this to me I had to make note that I’m impressed. What can I say, I’ve been using this machine almost daily for over 10 years and it’s still performing great. Once a year I descale it with vinegar and water, and use Urnez grindz cleaner on the grinder. ROI has been great at $5 a latte 6 days a week for 10 years is over $15,500.00… best $500 bucks I’ve ever spent."
3960,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The basket that you put in the coffee canister gets stock in the machine after you pull the shot.Is annoying since you have to pulled with your Hans every time you use it, Other wise if you know what you are doing you can pull a perfect shot every time.The Machine also tend to lose pressure very easily. Customer service does not exist.They are useless and not willing to help you."
3961,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Huge learning curve....outcome is inconsistent with every cup even after daily use for 2 weeks
3962,5.0,2018-05-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine, it is our first and we are hooked."
3963,1.0,2018-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,You can't get 2 cups of espresso at once. Barely gives out 1 cup. The milk wand quit working after a couple of days. Returned this machine.

 Not getting quality coffee from no"
3965,5.0,2017-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,BEST espresso maker ever. 100% worth the cost.
3966,1.0,2018-07-18, Black Sesame,It randomly leaks water all over my counter. When you push the two shot button it makes a weird staticky noise as if it’s gonna electrocute you. I messaged Breville about these problems. After a month of owning it and never got a reply back
3967,5.0,2014-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excelente!!!!
3968,1.0,2019-04-09, Black Sesame,Machine died within the year. Impossible to get ahold of company.

3970,1.0,2020-05-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine was turned on for the first time and then the smoke came out, was turned off and not turned on after a problem caused by electricity"
3971,1.0,2017-09-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Followed instructions exactly as described for setup. The machine sputters coffee everywhere and ruined furniture in the adjoining from from spraying espresso all over the place. Horrible experience.
3972,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Standby with problems, bad customer service. I returned the machine more than 5 days and my money is not back."
3973,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Purchased new in December 2018 from Amazon for $550. Still works like the day we bought it. Everything still works. It’s used 1-2 time daily.

3980,1.0,2015-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"While my machine stopped working within 1 year, specifically for the steamer, I call Breville, on hold for over 30 mins, and no one spoke to me. Cautious when you are considering buying an expensive item."
3981,5.0,2018-11-25, Black Sesame,This thing is a work of art. I love it.
3982,1.0,2018-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We had this for 4 months and used only for 2-3 espressos per day, properly cleabing and decalcifying it. After the clast cleaning it started making a very loud buzzing noise and there is no water flow and no pressure either. So it stopped working. Very dissatisfied and want to return it if possible!"
3983,5.0,2018-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,Takes some practice but makes great espresso.
3984,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great!
3985,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Right out of the box we tried for over one hour to get the beans to grind but to no avail!! You would think a $600+ dollar Espresso Machine would at least grind the beans?? I have to send it back and we are really disappointed…..I LOVE Breville products usually due to how well they are made!! Oh well, got a lemon I guess?"
3986,5.0,2018-10-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,WE LOVE IT!!!

3994,1.0,2015-08-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Had to send back - Voltage was not Dual-Voltage (but this is not stated on the website) and therefore wouldn't work in Singapore. Hard to be believe Amazon International sells this product to all overseas countries .

3997,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,These machines break after 2-3 years of reliable and undeniably excellent service. They can't be repaired locally so be prepared to send it to the recycler and buy a new one. Repairs at the factory will cost 50% of the replacement cost after shipping and repair costs. I've had three now and I'm leaving Breville for for a different manufacturer that can relied on and be repaired at a local shop.

4003,1.0,2019-07-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this item because it had great reviews. Totally disagree. This machine is difficult to get the pressure in range making the espresso very inconsistent. Machine is messy. Returned it and bought a DeLonghi ECAM22110SB. Much happier now.

4007,4.0,2022-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great machine if you are ready to start your home espresso making journey.

If you’re willing to watch all the YouTube videos and purchase all the accessories (tamper, dosing funnel, tamp box, etc) and pull dozens of poor shots as you work your way towards achieving the ideal grind and amount, then this is the machine for you, with a big caveat: Breville replacement parts for this unit are ALWAYS out of stock at Breville and are cheaply made, their counterparts sold on Amazon are priced at an ENORMOUS markup, and Breville customer service is spectacularly awful. Your entire machine could be put out of service because of one rubber gasket that costs 5c to make. The shower head seal on my machine has broken three times within a year. The replacement seal Breville sent me broke after a week, and the two replacement seals I bought by 3rd party vendors on Amazon broke after a couple of uses. So, caveat emptor."

4013,3.0,2018-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been using Breville Espresso Machines since 2004 exclusively. I am a bit torn on this review. I'm rating the Breville BES870XL experience.

Pros
- It makes fantastic coffee.
- Customer support at Breville has been pretty good overall.
- Solid unit.

Cons
- I cannot get one of these units to last much longer than 12-15 months. I upgraded to this unit around 2 1 1/2 years ago. After about a year it gave me warning signs it was having issues. The grinder stopped working for 1. So Breville sent me a completely reconditioned unit FREE of charge (shipping included). It was outside the warranty too.
- After getting the reconditioned unit, it was a lemon from day 1. It was leaking. I took a video of the unit and sent it to the support team. I had the same rep...who again was awesome. He ended up sending me a brand new and updated unit...latest version of the machine. Again free of charge. No questions asked.
- Ok...so it had been about 10-11 months into using the new unit when the annoying buzzing started to happen. I've been cleaning my unit and decalcifying it too. I contacted support about 1 month before my big Christmas party telling them what was going on. I even sent another video recording how the unit was working. 1) I don't like taking advantage of support and getting free products. That is not me. I just want a decent unit that will last for 5-6+ years. I bought my sister a Jura Espresso Machine that lasted about 9 years without a single problem FYI. Anyways, support began to drag their feet this time. That made sense, they gave me new unit ""free"" and now I'm complaining it is breaking. But still...I paid $600 not much more than 2 years ago. You'd think it would still last 2 years, right?Is that too much to ask that a unit last 5 years?
- Well...with all the major cleaning support told me to do (which I did...and that was crazy how much effort that took) the unit got worse. Good news, it did last (barely) through my Christmas party 2014.
- My option is to send the unit back, and they will fix it for $250 flat. This will take 2-3 weeks. The problem is, that is almost half the cost of a new unit, that again, last less than 2 years.

So after 10 years of being a Breville fan, I am now considering my options. I want to buy a machine that will last...and I don't want it to be cheap. I would warn you all in purchasing this unit. Now if you can pay an extra $100-200 to extend a warranty that would be great. Yet my other Breville units have lasted no longer than 3 years. I am someone who uses them daily...so they get used hard, but still for my own personal/family use: not a restaurant.

Update:
I bought a Miele machine from my local Oreck Vacuum dealer! Yes a vacuum shop! They are the authorized Miele dealer too. Their Miele Espresso machines are awesome. They have one issue I don't like: bad engineering. I have to manually push the beans down into the grinder half the time, because they did not make the whole bean canister funnel properly. Breville had this problem with their old units too. So it is a little bit of a pain, but I'm willing to deal with it. If the Miele breaks, these guys said they can fix them or give me a new unit anytime. So that was good enough for me to switch brands. The coffee is fantastic."
4014,5.0,2019-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,thanks^^ I have received goods.

4017,1.0,2017-09-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worked fine until my last east clean me light came on. I've tried three different descale products, cleaned out the coffee bean grinder and the light still won't go out. Holding the two cup size buttons down and Pressing the on button won't work either."
4018,5.0,2019-06-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Use it daily. Love it!
4019,1.0,2016-09-07, Black Sesame,"Astounding peice of crap! Every new coffee, you must learn the grind amount and fineness.
Buggy, expensive, annoying. Buy a 25$ moka pot, enjoy!"
4020,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The reviews here already do the machine justice, but I wanted to throw my two cents in. I've owned this machine for seven years, making coffee every day, and it's still operating like it was on day one. That's very impressive in the age of planned obsolescence for modern products.

That said, to keep it going for several years, proper maintenance is essential. I descale mine about every month or so. You can buy ""Cafiza Espresso Machine Cleaner Tablets"" at a much lower price than the ones that come with the machine. They work great, and it's a super easy process.

One lesser-known thing about Breville that I appreciate; they sell every individual part of this machine on their website, allowing you to opt to repair the machine instead of buying a whole new one if something breaks. I've never used it, but it's nice to know Breville stands behind their products.

My only qualm with the machine is how long it takes to steam the milk. It takes *roughly* 60 seconds. It's not an issue when you're making a single cup of coffee, but it can be a bit more inconvenient when making several cups. If you anticipate making several cups all at once, I'd encourage you to research the more powerful Breville machines to see if they'd be a better fit. But for personal use, this machine is just about perfect.

Whenever this machine eventually dies, I will happily purchase the same one again."
4021,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Not only was this NOT “like New” it wasn’t even the same model- oh! It was the right box and picture on the outside but it was the model with no grinder on top!!! And no accessories...WTH! Very sad!

4031,1.0,2019-05-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bad idea to buy this espresso maker :( Looks good on the out side but but it's a defective unit with erratic behavior.

4057,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,This machine is everything. That sounds so dramatic but I mean it. Of course quality beans produce quality coffee but the Breville is perfection. I got the machine in December of 2018. It’s now 4 years later and it still functions perfectly. Do not hesitate to buy this. You are less than 5 minutes away from a latte at any given point.
4058,5.0,2017-06-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great machine

4060,5.0,2021-03-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very excellent and process
4061,4.0,2022-08-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've owned 2 previous, all automatic espresso machines, so this one is quite a learning curve for me. My daughter has this one and ensured me that it is the the one to have. But, I feel that I will be a full barista by the time I get it figured out. The grind gauge, amount of grind, pressure to use when tamping, and then watching the pressure gauge and counting how many seconds it takes for the ""honey"" consistency of brew to pour from the basket is all very time consuming and tricky for me. I've been using it for a week now and still have a wet puck and bitter tasting espresso. I need something quick and easy, not a whole project to work on before going to work each morning. Praying that I get it figured out soon."
4062,5.0,2017-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I use this espresso machine daily. I've had it for about two or three years. I like physically preparing the grounds in the portafilter myself - it's become a big part of my daily routine. First, I wake up and wonder what the meaning of it all is and whether or not I have the will to carry on for another day. I think about all the mistakes I've made and whether or not I'll ever find true love. Then I take a leak and drink some ice water. I know I know - I know what you're thinking, ""Ice water?!?! First thing in the morning?? That's crazy."" Well maybe it is but that's just me. So after I pace back and forth for a while kind of stretching and kind of still waking up somewhat, I find my crazy dog Max (he's a miniature schnauzer) curled up in a little ball in his usual spot on the sofa and give him pets and kisses while he growls at me. He tolerates my existence because I feed him and walk him sometimes.

After all that's out of the way... it is time for my coffee baby! Woo! I get out my favorite mug and pour in some oatmilk halfway up the mug (it's a small mug). I don't use the stainless steel ""milk jug"" and I don't run hot water through the portafilter and into my mug to get them warmed up like it says you're supposed to do in the instruction manual. I simply press the power button, let it do its little ""hummm"" sound to get started, and then I fill the filter basket with some fresh grounds. I pack em' down and press into the grounds grinder again, as I always go for a double but grind the beans for it in two separate packing stages. I've just found it to be easier. YMMV. I lock in the portafiler and brew into my freshly foamed oatmilk. Voila!

A solid product with good construction from a good company. 5/5."
4063,5.0,2018-11-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,love it!!!!!!
4064,5.0,2017-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,perfectly made
4065,5.0,2018-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a good machine for those who have cut their teeth on beginner machines like the DeLonghi ECP3420, which is what I had before this one. Before that, I had a Capresso 4-Cup Espresso & Cappuccino Machine Model # 303.01, which makes coffee not unlike a Moka pot, but the principals of dosing and tamping into a portafilter were there, and were good at teaching me those skills. This Breville is the next step up on my espresso machine journey, and so far I think it works just fine.

There are just enough fine adjustments on the built-in grinder to understand the factor of grind size and how it works together with dose and tamping. The pressure gauge is not numerical but rather descriptive, showing divisions between pre-infusion and espresso range which I find more user-friendly. Rather than getting caught up and hyperfocusing on the standard 9-bar setting needed to get a textbook espresso, the word based range keeps the learning curve between shallow and steep, and allows for a peace of mind when seeing that the needle is more or less at 12 to 1 o'clock.

The machine comes with a set of single wall filters as well as a set of double wall filters to be used with pre-ground coffee, or as I've been doing, with the leftover grounds created during honing in on a good grind size with the built-in grinder. The tamp and razor trimming tool are fine tools for getting the dosed coffee at the right level in the portafilter.

I'm not a latte or Cappuccino person, so I've only used the steam wand once to try and steam milk, and it works fine. My technique is what needs work.

The drip tray is a nice design. A little float labelled ""Empty me!"" tells you when it's time to empty and clean the tray.

I could break this review down more and get into very fine details, but what I've lined out is enough. All in all, if you're looking for a machine to train on and hone your espresso making skills, this is a very good option."
4066,5.0,2017-03-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best one!
4067,2.0,2018-03-20, Black Sesame,"Feb 11, 2021 stopped working being used periodically by two people."
4068,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Rather than make a full on review of everything that has been covered here multiple times, I thought I would point out some of the thinks you may like or not like about this machine. It makes a very good cup and for those not ready to shell out $2K for the true prosumer brands like Rocket, this is a stand out amongst the ""high street"" top end consumer machines. The main competitor to this machine is the Gaggia Classic so I will use it often as a reference.

1) Has a great look but very plasticy. many of the parts I assumed were metal turn out to be plastic. It feels a bit cheaper than it looks and only time will tell how durable it is. The Gaggia is tank like.

2) Uses a non standard 54mm portafiler as opposed to the 58mm industry standard. This means additional or replacements or can be a pain and will be expensive. The naked filter cost $150. Ouch.

3) Heats up very quickly and is ready to go from cold. Awesome for cold difficult mornings.

4) Uses a real, albeit slightly under-pressured wand. You can, with some practice, get real silky textured milk unlike units which use a panarello wand, like the Gaggia.

5) Water tank is a bit awkward to use and remove. Handle seems fragile, only time will tell. I use a cup to pour in water rather than always pulling the tank. This also helps alleviate much of the ""mystery water"" on the counter top.

6) The dry storage tray is simply awesome. Very inspired. Now it is constantly getting stuck all the time inside the machine. It only worked for a week. Going to use some magnets. Also, water get's into the dry tray, not much, but enough to keep an eye on. EDIT: My original unit had a leak. New one stays dry and has not yet gotten stuck.

7) Like every other auto machine I have ever owned or used, mystery water ends up on my counter-top. Jura, Saeco, they all have little drippies somewhere. My original unit had a leak, the new unit has very little mystery water.

7a)This awesome five dollar steel tray fits the portafilter perfectly: Oggi 7048 Stainless Steel Spoon Rest. Keep that drainage for your counter. See pics: some mystery water and the awesome spoon.

8) Tamping is really less messy than you would think. I end up with less coffee grounds on the counter than with my super autos.

9) $1500 for the auto tamping model is just excessive. Though it does have the 58mm portafilter. I just cannot justify buying the Oracle.

10) Latte art is possible with this. Takes practice though.

11) Cleaning is very easy.

12) Super easy to use machine in general. Very good to great shots. Allows for some manual control.

13) The grinder is surprisingly good. Must clean it often though.

14) Brews like a $1000 machine easy.

15) Heats up milk a bit slowly. 15 bars instead of the Gaggia's 18.

16) Excellent accessorizes that feel very sturdy.

17) Maybe not as purist as the Gaggia, but I prefer this one.

18) Removable hoppers are good but require more counter clearance. Many of the videos show the older, lower, profile model. Extra hoppers are cheap and I can keep multiple hoppers for decaf and reg or different types of beans. Note that Breville's own website still shows the older model.

19) Uses a lot of water. I mean A LOT. Seems like I am always filling the tank. More than once per a single session. Leads to the next one. EDIT: My original unit had a leak. Uses less water now that it is not ending up on my countertop.

20) My number one pet peeve: Unlike literally every coffee machine of any type I have owned for the past 20 years, this thing does NOT let you know when you are out of water. It will just keep trying to run dry, chuggin' away and that can't be good for it. Super annoying, especially considering how often the tank empties.

Hope this helps some people."

4075,4.0,2016-10-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The broad consensus among people who like to brew their own espresso is that this machine is a nice starter package, but that the built-in grinder has high grind retention and the steps are too coarse to truly get quality espresso.

4095,5.0,2019-06-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Yes you can find $100 espresso machines at the store. But they will not be the same quality machine or produce good, quality espresso like this machine. Use nice, non oily beans- not starbucks. Beans that are too oily can hurt the inside grinding mechanism. My husband was told by a breville repairman that he often sees and repairs machines that have never been cleaned or descaled. Tablets for cleaning and descaling are available- buy them and use them at least every 3-6 months. Not cleaning the machine properly is why a lot of reviews say that their machine broke or quit working. We've had ours 3 or 4 years now, and it works as good as the day it was purchased because we take great care of it. It gets used daily if not a couple of times a day. I would even think this machine would perform well for a restaurant. It's that good. Don't go cheap and take care of your investment. Videos on cleaning and descaling can be found on YouTube."

4103,1.0,2014-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,4 months in and the grinder is broken as well as won’t get enough pressure to make a cup.
4104,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought a black version from Whole Latte Love. This is my first espresso machine. I pulled my first shots with the pressurized baskets just to get a basic feel for the machine. These pressurized baskets pull decent shots that hit around 10-11 o clock on the pressure gauge (using the default setting on the grinder, which is a 6 I believe, and grind level around 3 o clock). Soon, I tried out the non pressurized baskets. After some experimentation with tamping pressure, grind setting, and grind level, (and some bad test shots) I've got pretty consistently good shots after less than a month and a half of ownership. Using fresh, locally roasted coffee- pulling a good shot is now almost a no-brainer. For my coffee type, these settings work well: grinder on 7-8 and grind level on 2-3 o clock. I hit around 12 o clock on the pressure gauge almost every time, which gives me a steady stream of crema-soaked coffee that turns light brown near the end of the pull. I typically pull double shots, but similar settings work for single. Regarding tamping: I shake the portafilter while the coffee loads up from the grinder, cup my palm over the top to help compress the coffee, finger level, lightly spin the tamper to even the grinds, and then give a mild but firm press. In my experience, you don't need to tamp these things too hard (or else you choke the extraction). I tried using ""The Razor"" accessory to check my dosage but I prefer to just use my eyes/hands.

I like that the bean hopper is removable. I keep my beans in a Tightvac, dump them into the grinder before brewing, and then lock/dump the residual beans back in the Tightvac when I'm done. The hopper fits perfectly over a 1/2lb Tightvac for no spillage. This keep my beans fresh (a small amount will stay in grinder even when you pull the hopper off, nbd).

I've only used the frothing wand a handful of times. My impression is it's just OK (or maybe I need to just work on my technique), and could maybe use a little more power. With that said, I can make a decent cortado with this machine, but I typically pass on milk with my coffee.

Clean-up is pretty easy. the whole drip tray comes apart in three pieces which can be quickly scrubbed and let to dry. I run a single shot after I'm done brewing to clean the brew head, and then I wipe the brew head with a clean cloth.

For those of you who haven't bought a home espresso machine before- these things are not quiet. Hopefully your significant other won't mind getting rudely interrupted from their slumbers by the RRRAA RAAA RRRR of the grinder if you make an extra shot for them.

Things I look forward to experimenting with: dialing in different locally-roasted coffees, experimenting with temperature settings (default = 200F, but my favorite coffee shop says the set their machines at 202F), and then getting more precise with my coffee dosage using an electric scale. As you can see there is plenty of growth for the amateur espresso appreciator. After about 3 months, I've got no regrets with this as my first machine."
4105,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Not sure how to claim this, but the machine is broken after 2 months! How can I claim warranty and repair/replace this product?"

4107,1.0,2019-09-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Beautiful. BUT , the second time I ground coffee, beans got stuck in grinder, couldn’t follow directions how to disassemble that part, & worst of all, MOTOR died. Within a week!"
4108,5.0,2014-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Best barista coffee maker! It is easy to use-read the manual first- and yield a rich and creamy expresso coffee. I have the barista coffee maker for over 4 years and has never failed me. I read all the reviews with quite numbers of poor evaluations; here are the reasons: know the appliance-read the manual, clean the coffee maker as soon the machine lets you know ( light indicator), use the recommended products to clean it thoroughly, clean the grinder as instructed in the manual- I clean mine every six month to keep the burrs in good operational condition. Therefore, just like you have an automobile you have to provide maintenance to ensure long lasting use. And I never had any issues with customer service when I ask for consult related to other Breville appliances I have.
Hope this review help you to operate and maintain this wonderful barista coffee maker."

4112,5.0,2019-07-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine doesn’t make you an expert just for buying it, nor does it give you super powers, but it does come very close. There are still things to learn before you’ll be making the “ perfect cup”, but relative to other machines this thing is awesome… and I’ve owned many others over the past forty five years. Very high quality!! It does require periodic cleaning of the internals. There are plenty of UTube videos that explain the process."
4113,5.0,2014-10-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My out of warranty Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine BES870XL started leaking water and coffee grounds around the head where the portafilter attaches. I did some research and saw that it was a fairly easy job of replacing the O-ring gasket so I ordered a new one though Breville's website.

The new O-ring gasket did not fix the problem. After I replaced it I noticed right away that the portafilter did not feel nearly as snug as I remembered it did when new. Sure enough, a large amount of the first shot went all over the kitchen counter.

I went online to see if I could find a solution. I read one page that said, ""As the Breville machines age, the inner plastic collar that the portafilter screws into wears. meaning sometimes you can change the steam ring or group seal and the portafilter still feels loose and may leak. In this case we can use a packer placed behind the group seal. Browse the Breville coffee machine parts for a packer.""

I looked for a while but could not locate such a part -- the ""packer"" I read about. That is when I decided to call Breville customer service to see about ordering one.

When I called the toll-free number, Breville provided a way for me to give my phone number for a callback to keep from inconveniencing me from having to hold / wait for them to answer. I received a call about 5 minutes later from their customer service.

The nice man asked me what the problem was and I told him that I had a BES870XL and that the head had recently started to leak. I informed him that replacing the O-ring did not solve the problem. I told him that I had read about a part called a packer that I'd like to order. Mr Customer Service kindly informed me that the issue was probably a bad collar where the portafilter mates with the machine and that the only way to fix it was by Breville's own technicians.

I was bracing for bad news here. I was really expecting him to say something like, ""Sorry, your machine is out of warranty but for a small fee of $200 we'll be able to take care of your problem."" But no! Here is what he told me instead:
Mister X, I will email you a prepaid UPS shipping label and mail you the packing materials. When you receive the box and packing materials send us the machine minus the water tank, trays, bean hopper, etc -- just send us the base unit. We will fix this for you despite it being out of warranty. If we cannot fix it we will send you a new one.

I was incredulous! Before we finished I thanked him at least three times -- probably more.

That call was on a Friday. The Monday after next I received the packing materials with which to send the machine back for servicing. I sent it off that same day. It was returned to me 9 days later.

Every step of the way, Breville sent me emails with the UPS tracking numbers so I always knew where the machine was and when I could expect it back.

The entire repair took less than two weeks. My machine is back to making great coffee again."
4114,1.0,2020-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Stopped grinding after 2 seconds. Motor just gave out. Couldnt even make one cup of espresso. Extremely dissapointed.
4115,2.0,2017-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Taste of coffee is not that reliable... I'm not sure it is worth the money.
4116,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I recibed a used machine and it was not clean!!!
4117,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I read several comparisons before deciding to buy this machine and I am supper happy for this purchase.
The main advantage I found on this product is the possibility to make a great coffee but without the complexity of fully automated machines.
The possibility to separate the grinding and the coffee making allows much more freedom than any other machine and makes the maintenance and the cleaning much simpler.
The other big advantage is the possibility to control and customize the entire process, from grinding to the final extraction. All the main parameters can be changed, giving the possibility to the experts to fine tune the preparation of the perfect coffee. At the end, once you found the right coffee, (this is really the critical parameter to start with), it will take few trials to find the perfect balance between grinding size, quantity, temperature and extraction time. In my case I didn’t have to chance drastically the preset values: I’ve just increased the temperature of 2degrees, setup the grinding to a medium-fine and I find the perfect combination for a tasty and creamy coffee.
The real key, at the end, is to ensure that, during extraction, the pressure always stays in the perfect range, to avoid a too light or too strong taste. This is, at the end, the biggest advantage of this machine, if compared to the fully automatic ones.
Finally: one note about the engineering and material quality. Both are really high in this product.
A final note on the coffee: of course this is the most subjective item: I personally suggest to opt for Lavazza or Illy: avoid the Starbucks grain as they are, for me, always too bitter or too much toasted. Ok for a long coffe but totally wrong for a good espresso. I will update this review in the future, if any problem will occur. So far I rate this machine with a 5 stars"
4118,5.0,2016-05-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Its been nearly 2 years and I use this machine day in, day out. Usually 2-5 times a day (more when friends and family visit). I use all the functions from grinding beans, brewing espresso, using the steam wand, the tamper, the supplied milk frothing container, and even the hot water dispenser for making americanos and tea pretty much on demand.

I do all the scheduled maintenance. About every 30 days I do a 50/50 vinager/water flush. Whenever the ""clean me"" light kicks on I do a tablet flush. So about every 4-6 weeks of daily use I take some time to help my machine run optimally. I do really notice a difference after a fresh flush. It steams better and makes a better shot.

It does take some practice to get the perfect grind/pressure with whatever whole bean of your choose. But, unlike some negative reviews, once I find the propper settings, I get extremely consistent results every single time.

Everyone requests my ""special"" coffees when they come over. Which I love and hate just because this is not exactly a mass producing machine. If you follow all the proper steps to brew and keep the machine clean it does take some time. So making cafe lattes for 3+ people is a bit cumbersome. But the smiles and compliments always make it worth it.

Right now I pair with ""Coffee Direct"" whole beans which are found on Amazon. I have tried the french roast and espresso roast. I set the dial to 3 on the grinder. Then it all comes down to practice and experience using the tamper to get the proper pressure. I do this daily and I have it down to a science. Same settings for Starbucks Espresso beans. Again, its all down to tamping hard enough but not too hard.

Also, ALWAYS have a wet rag ready to wipe the milk frother before walking away. Also, run it for a 1-3 seconds with a cup underneath just to flush any residual milk out. This will keep it going again and again. Otherwise milk will dry on and clog it. Also, I always run a flush through the screen without the portafliter at the end of each brew session to remove any residual grounds before wiping the machine down and unplugging.

Ill update as the machine ages. So far though zero issues beyond the learning curve to get the perfect brew. But that's not machine dependent, that's the barista. It won't make the best frothed milk for doing art but it steams milk consistently and its quite fine. Others that say the steamer isn't good enough I'd say just don't have the experience yet with this machine. Its more than fine. But ive been making home espresso for 15 years starting with a basic entry level machine. So I have had alot of practice with subpar machines. So when I upgraded to a more mid level entry it was super easy to adapt. Only thing I'd like to try in the future is the double broiler model which allows for steaming and brewing at the same time.

This machine has paid for itself over two years compared to how much I used to go to Starbucks for my espresso fix. I'm going to drink coffee regardless so having an amazing machine like this at my finger tips has been a no brainer."

4122,4.0,2017-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great little machine. Paid for itself many times over. We made 3 or 4 drinks per day for 6 years. That’s over 7,000 drinks. I figure that milk and coffee beans cost 25-30cents a cup. Compared to a $4 latte at any coffee shop I’m saving $3.50 a cup. After 7,000 cups that’s over $22,000 saved. Not bad for a $600 investment. After 6 1/2 years the wand literally blew off the body of the machine today. It cannot be reattached. And the parts are not easily available. We clean it. We decalcify it. I’m happy enough with this machine’s performance and durability to go out and buy another exactly the same."
4123,1.0,2018-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"These Breville machines DO NOT LAST!!!! I’m on my second one and it is falling apart after I paid to have it fixed. They said they sent me a new one, but the replacement one is worse than my original. Now customer service says they cannot even fix my replacement one until September...and for $450!!!! They said if I didn’t want to wait, they would sell me a new one at 60% off...for $800!!! What does it tell you that the service dept. is that backed up. What a frickin’ racket!!! Now the cup warmer on mine gets red hot and burns me daily. It drips water from the group head right into the espresso shot, from the steam wand, right into the milk. It drips water from everywhere. I fill the reservoir up and it is leaked out after making two latte’s. The front display screen is all bubbled from the heat of the ‘warming’ tray that gets red hot and now all the display warnings flicker on and off. DO NOT BUY A BREVILLE!!!!!!"
4124,5.0,2017-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been trying to find a good home espresso machine for a while, but I've been underwhelmed with what I've found. I finally decided I needed to move up to a higher-end model if I was going to find what I needed. After a lot of research, I decided on the Breville Barista Express, and I'm so glad I did! I use this machine every morning and often in the evening, and it gives really impressive results.

Pros:
-The grinder works really well, and I like the fact that you can dial it in to give you the perfect amount of espresso.
-It has a regular tamper, but as soon as you get a feel for it, you just do it the same every time.
-I almost always get great extraction when I brew, and my pressure is perfect.
-Most of the time I brew lattes, so when it's time to switch over to the steamer, it was very intuitive to use, especially if you've spent years in coffee shops watching baristas at work.

Cons:
-It's a single boiler, so you can either brew espresso or steam milk, but not both at the same time. At this price point, you're not going to find a double boiler, and the increased cost for one was not worth it for me.
-Also, the automatic grinder makes a bit of a mess. The grounds mound up high enough that some of them invariably spill and it gets wasted. It's not much, but it is something.
-And I wish that the water reservoir was larger. It's easy to fill, but with two of us using it a couple of times a day, it doesn't take long to run out. But all of these cons are pretty minor.

Other notes:
-Use fresh beans. I buy whole beans from my favorite coffee place.

-In order to truly get full use out of this, I feel there are some accessories that are must-haves. Including:
-Knock Box: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B9TQTLH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. This is the box that the barista uses to knock the puck out of the portafilter. You could just knock it on your garbage can, but that's kind of gross.
-Milk Thermometer: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JAHSXEI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. I've seen a lot of reviews and videos that say to just hold the pitcher until it is too warm to comfortably touch, but it's much easier to have a thermometer in there. You can hear a definite difference in sound as your milk steams, and when it's getting close, it's nice to have a thermometer that shows you the range you're looking for.
-Bar Mops: https://smile.amazon.com/GOLD-TEXTILES-Cotton-Restaurant-Kitchen/dp/B0874VB9V4/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=bar+towels&qid=1618502342&s=home-garden&sr=1-8. Any towels would work, but I like having these, because I'm not worried about the espresso or grounds staining them, and I have plenty to use between laundry loads.
-Espresso glasses: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MALMT2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. You could use regular shot glasses, but we didn't have any at home, so we ordered these. These are double-wall insulated, and keep the espresso nice and hot before you use it. Also, the portafilter is kind of low, so many of your coffee cups will not fit under the spout. These fit perfectly.
-Larger Pitcher: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RZSCVWS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. With this, I can steam milk for both me and my wife at the same time.
-Latte mugs: https://smile.amazon.com/Momugs-Ceramic-Coffee-Handle-Friends/dp/B06XDL7CFF/ref=sr_1_29?dchild=1&keywords=20+oz+latte+mugs&qid=1618502661&s=home-garden&sr=1-29. I like to have a 20 oz latte, and it's much nicer to have a tall glass to use.
-Bar Spoons: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S023L8I/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. With the larger mugs along with my travel mugs, my regular spoons didn't reach low enough to really mix things up. These make it much easier.
-Iced Latte Cups: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B081S8VHDF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. These are large enough for me to make my large lattes like I prefer, and the insulation helps to keep it colder longer.
-Coffee Storage Container: https://smile.amazon.com/Airscape-Coffee-Storage-Canister-Beans/dp/B07W6RKJVF/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=coffee+storage&qid=1618502935&sr=8-6. I was using this even before getting this machine, and it does a great job at keeping everything fresh.

It's a lot of extra accessories, but the result is that I feel I can truly make a profession latte at home, and I absolutely love my setup. I can make lattes that taste exactly like my favorite coffee shop. This was a bit of an splurge, but I'm so happy I did so."
4125,1.0,2019-02-02, Black Sesame,"Cheap and doesn’t work as expected
The worst experience I ever had"
4126,1.0,2015-11-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,Had it for a week and the grinder broke. Total junk.
4127,1.0,2017-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Died within 1month ,used it about 20times"
4128,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good while it worked. I bought it 10 months ago and it already stopped working. It doesn't produce enough pressure and also the milk steamer works randomly.
4129,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine since 2014, using it multiple times a day. I frequently host guest, and everyone who has a latte or cappuccino at my house raves about it. My lattes are better than starbucks for both froth and espresso quality. . The Breville produces drastically better quality of espresso and foam than a friend's machine which cost thousands! It has been going strong for 5 years now, and I have brewed over 3,600 lattes with it, plus random espressos, and frothed milk for other beverages. So, to date, it has cost me less than 13 cents per cup for the machine to brew daily treats that would cost over $3 each at a coffee shop. That doesn't count the cost of beans or milk, but even with that, this machine is worth its steep price many times over. A few times, I've had to tinker with settings or do some extra cleaning to keep it running smoothly, but every time I thought it might have a problem, simple re-adjusting of grind and/or cleaning did the trick. I haven't even needed to replace any parts yet, though I'm surprised that the gaskets are still holding, and pressure is still perfect. Cleaning is super easy, as it is automated. Just fill with water, put a big bowl under the spout, press the buttons and walk away until it beeps to indicate that its done! Grind is very adjustable, and sometimes needs to be adjusted when switching types of beans. A simple turn of the wheel changes the grind settings. I personally have not found the single filter size to be very effective (it doesn't produce much of anything), so we have always used the 'double' size for single cups. It works perfectly. My step-mother loved the cappuccinos so much that I bought my father a duplicate of my machine. He's been using his since 2015, and everyone he serves latte to raves about it as well. He finds that he saves money on beans because he can easily brew a cup at a time, which is all he wants. He prefers regular 'americano' 6 days a week, saving the fancy features for Sundays, and finds it easy to brew to his liking. My neighbor is at my house most weekday mornings for a latte. She liked the machine so much she bought one, and now her husband is hooked on it as well. My daughter tried a less expensive machine and found that once you have this Breville, anything else is disappointing. I can tell that as my children set up homes of their own, I've going to be getting these as housewarming gifts.... I only wish I got a volume discount! Even if this machine were to break tomorrow (which is very unlikely, except that I'm leaving a rave review, which is often a precursor to trouble), I would have more than gotten my money's worth in amazing, creamy-foamed lattes and cappuccinos, warm frothy vanilla milk on cold winter nights, and espressos following special occasion dinners. Dependable, Very high quality, and easy to use. I can't imagine how it could be improved. No other appliance I've ever used (and I have used many) has ever been so trouble-free and brought so much joy."
4130,4.0,2019-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Prefacing this with review with some of my experience. I have worked for dozens of cafes using high grade espresso machines between the range of 10k-30k USD. I have extensive training on cleaning, troubleshooting, and dialing in machines/grinders. That said let me go over a few things about the BES870XL.

I ended up purchases a USED unit, as I was super comfortable in my ability to service and clean most espresso machines. I made this purchase after I was laid-off my last barista job due to COVID, and wanted to keep my skills sharp. Very first issue I had with the machine was the grinder. It was very much uncalibrated, and not sure if that's the fault of the previous owner, or factory, but if you're having issues dialing the grind size, the burrs are adjustable; not just by the knob, but you can open the machine and set up the distance between the burrs. I recommend this being the first step if you bought this machine in order to use the grinder. Recommend using a grind brush to get into the burrs and do a deep clean.

The water tank is a great size for someone who plans on making a few drinks a day, and refilling it is a BREEZE. You can safely grab it by the pull down handle, and haven't had any issues with cracks/leaks. Added bonus for being easy to clean as well.

The drip tray is great. I probably can't ask for much in a drip tray, and it's hard to get these wrong but could be a little easier to clean. There's a lot of grooves that require a little more attention to detail but it's mostly just the nature of coffee and espresso as a brewing method. Some attentiveness required but another part that's easy to clean.

The tamper is good enough. My only gripe is that it's not a perfectly flush fit with the portafilter, and as much as it bothered me, I did like that it magnetically attaches to the underside on top of the machine. Overall feelings about it is that, it does the job but if you want a better experience, I ended up purchasing a distributor/tamper 2-in-1 device here on amazon. It definitely elevated my espresso and provided unmatched consistency. I'd like to see better with future models.

The steam wand :C . I was thankful to have a functional steam wand, but many of my friends who purchased the same model had a lot of problems relating to the steam wand (AND they purchased brand new models). I will speak for the quality of MINE. It's subpar. To be expected for a sub 1k machine, but I think looking forward, or recommending a machine to a buddy, I will be leading with the fact that it's not the best experience. Nothing like using my professional industrial grade machines at work, BUT it will steam your milk. You can get the type of foam you want, but it has severe consistency issues. A tool is provided to poke into the hole, and basic cleaning will help you out severely, but my biggest criticism with the wand is that it's incredibly slow. If you're new to foaming milk, it might be a better experience as you will learn the basic principles at a slower rate, but you can expect each step to easily be double the time when coming from a professional machine. Thinks like aeration takes about double the time, getting a great whirlpool takes twice as long, etc etc. That said I'm generally happy with my end result, and manage to find making latte art just fine.

The milk pitcher provided is okay, not great. I will be upgrading one soon but most of the ones I want have been out of stock for a while. It's rather small and I drink a lot of coffee, so take that as you will, you can get fine results with it. Brushed SS, doesn't stain and cleans easily.

My general consensus is that for a majority of us, it's a perfectly fine experience, and the novelty of having an espresso machine at home doesn't wear off. If you're concerned with the cost effectiveness of buying this product, I'd say you're in for a treat if you plan on owning this for the long haul. I moved apartments easily and was shocked by how light it was and easy to move. It's built fine but you need to know how to service a machine, or at least troubleshoot. With the mass of quality control issues I've seen floating around, it only leads me to believe you may need to get lucky to have a perfectly functional one, which I can't put a stamp of approval on behind a $700 product. BUT if you do manage to get one that works out the box, or fixable, it's a machine I've used nearly everyday for the last YEAR with no issues that I couldn't fix. I drink about 3-4 espresso drinks a day, and as I write this review I'm enjoying a latte freshly made off it. It expresses coffee well, and for it's price it is all inclusive; just by coffee, milk, and be on your way day 1."
4131,5.0,2019-09-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I spent a lot of time thinking about this espresso machine before I bought it. I'm a former barista and after several years out of the game I realized I missed making espresso drinks. But how much use would I really get out of a home espresso machine? What if this turned out to be a passing interest and I end up with a $600 machine taking up space on my counter? After at least six months of trying to talk myself out of buying it, I finally bit the bullet. After three weeks I'm very happy to report that I love this machine and I never want to be apart from it.

It really covers all of the bases - you can get up and running with everything included. A couple of shot glasses are nice to have, especially at first as you're dialing in the grind etc. Don't buy the Delonghi ones with the rounded lip edges, they just barely fit under the portafilter side-by-side. They work fine but I wish I'd looking for some with straight walls. And a knock box is really really helpful. Order all that stuff at once with this machine and you will be set.

It took about a week for me to get my espresso shots just right but I wasn't putting a lot of dedicated time into it. After the first day I had workable espresso, but some adjustments along the way got it just right. Minor complaint: the grounds don't hit the portafilter quite in the middle so I have to re-distribute a little bit and lose some grounds in the process. But I think I've landed on a dose and grind that works pretty consistently even taking that into account. Trader Joes espresso beans are really not too shabby.

The potrafilter is reassuringly solid - you know how some home machines have a portafilter that feels like a toy? This one is much nicer. The steam wand also gets the job done. I have no problem making nice microfoam with it and the included milk pitcher works great.

I have quickly learned to take the ""empty me"" drip tray warning seriously - once it appears you really don't have much more room to play with. Same for the water tank, it needs to be filled pretty frequently. I've just gotten in the habit of filling the tank and emptying the drip tray before I start making drinks and I don't run into trouble. Also helpful - warming cups with hot water from an electric kettle rather than the built-in hot water dispenser. The built-in spout is slow and warming up two mugs uses a bunch of water.

Shout out to the reviewer who suggested buying a pack of Amazon Basics washcloths to keep on hand with the machine as you use it, this has been very useful and I endorse this suggestion. I can't think of anything else I'd advise the prospective buyer on - if you don't have experience making your own espresso drinks I can see how this might feel like a significant learning curve. It might be a bit too much trouble to go to if you're just interested in saving money on trips to Starbucks, maybe something more automatic would be best. But if you really want to be hands-on and enjoy the process of making a latte, or you want to learn it, this is a great machine."
4132,4.0,2015-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been using the Barista Express for more than 5 years, and many times I wanted to upgrade to an Italian expresso machine which costs twice to 4 times of this one because I haven't had a good straight espresso shot from this one. For a latte it's a hit and miss. Lately I went online and I did some researches for a new replacement. Meanwhile, I am applying what people do with the expensive machines to the Barista Express, and here is the list:
- Turn on the machine and wait for at least 15 minutes before pulling the shot
- Use quality beans
- Use correct technique for frothing the milk
- Dial the grinder and measure the coffee for consistently

Now into the details:
- I learned to be patient and wait for the boiler to heat up before pulling the shot, min = 15 mins. Don't forget to plug in your portafiler, with no coffee, when you turn on the machine.
- Buy good quality beans with correct roasting profile. I only buy light and medium roast beans from highly rated micro roaster, and I can tell you it make a big difference. To reduce the cost, I sampled coffee from different roasters to pick out the ones I love then buy them in bulk, 2lb or 5lb bags when the roasters give out promotions.
- I use non-pressurized double basket and I found the shot is very consistent with 19 gram of coffee. With my machine, the grinder setting is between 7-9 and you may want to experiment the setting to match with your bean and grinder calibration.
- I adjust my grind size, fixed 19gram of coffee, tamping pressure and beans so that I get the shot pressure at 1o'clock on the gauge. Anything below that will results in fast brewing time.
- The yield is around 35-37 grams of espresso.
- I frother the milk before pulling shot.
- I strongly suggest you use the dose trimmer while you are experimenting the doses and tamping pressure

After doing those things, my latte is amazing, specially having the good beans with correct techniques. I have to be honest that I haven't gotten a good espresso for drinking straight shot, still a bit bitter or sour but it is much better than before.
The barista express would be perfect if it had 58mm portafilter. I also found the grind setting moves after a few grinds so you need to pay attention to that.
Conclusion: I will stick with the barista express until it is broken."
4133,1.0,2020-09-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Used it 10 days and grinder would not work. Not easy to clean.
4134,1.0,2019-09-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,It broke in less than 1 year. Hopefully there is a good warranty
4135,1.0,2017-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,It came without any instructions
4136,5.0,2018-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have had our machine for five years and I am just as happy with it as I was on the day we got it. It was an investment that has paid for itself.
4137,5.0,2017-10-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ok... So I live in Los Angeles.. I frequent places like urth cafe and Intelligencia.. I definitely appreciate a good latte! I researched espresso machines for 2 months... Like many, I thought about getting a good burr grinder and decent espresso machine or this.. So happy I got the barista express! I picked up the machine and drove straight to a coffee roaster and picked up a pound of their freshly roasted espresso blend, came home and after trying 2 grind settings got a PERFECT shot. Hit right in the middle of the espresso range on the dial and produced a rich creama... Mind you, I don't drink straight up shots.. I prefer lattes made with almond milk and no sweetener.. The drinks came out delicious! Just as good as a cafe without the 6bucks plus tip! So today I was board and decided to try store bought beans... I paid 17 bucks for the pound of fresh roasted beans at the roaster, and wanted to see what difference the store bought beans made.. I picked up a package of Starbucks Sumatra beans for 7 bucks and some change.. Went home, emptied the beans that were in the hopper, grinded the rest that remained in the grinder, and loaded some of the Sumatra blend. I left the grind setting on 2, and filled up a double shot in the portafilter using the non-pressurized basket.. And it hit right in the middle of the espresso range! Got a nice creama on the shot too. I poured it into a glass, added ice, and filled it up with cold almond milk for an iced latte. And I have to admit, it was just as good as the lattes I made with the freshly roasted beans! It's delicious! People say there is a huge learning curve with this machine... And after reading endless reviews it makes you feel like you are going to waste so much coffee getting the grind, dose, and tamp right... It's really not that difficult.. If you can follow simple instructions you should be good! It's so easy and just as good as coffee shops! If you have common sense and can follow simple direction, the only thing that might require a learning curve is steaming the milk.. But it really isn't hard. Just might take a little time to prefect it. I was going to get a capresso ec pro and a Breville smart dose grinder.. But I am so happy I didn't! I like the fact that this machine automatically cools down after using the milk steaming wand to get to the correct temp for espresso extraction unlike the cheaper machines and the fact that you can change the temp of the brew up and down. This machine is a great deal. Plus the spout for hot water is a HUGE plus if you drink tea. No more waiting for a pot of water to boil on the stove :) and don't use all your body weight to tamp the coffee. Applying 30lbs of pressure really isn't that much weight. A nice firm push and twist will do it! Will update review after a couple months of use :)"
4138,1.0,2015-05-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is refurbished! Stopped working after 2 months
4139,2.0,2017-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love the product and its results. However to expensive for how long the unit last. I have had my unit for about 2 years and paid 699.99 for it. Its been great to use(multiple time daily) just did not last for the money spent.
4140,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes great tasting coffee and easy to use. But after 18 months it no longer functions. Steam wand and hot water dispenser need repair, whether it’s a clogged line or dead pump I can’t say. But since it is post warranty, $295 is the price."
4141,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Product did not work properly.
4142,1.0,2018-02-09, Black Sesame,👍🏼
4143,5.0,2014-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When I started with the machine it ""didn't work"" and I packed it up to return---and forgot about it. Then after a year or so I thought I'd try it again before donating it, and either I got smarter or it did because it worked like a charm. And I am now dependent on it. On the road early the other day I got a Starbucks and it was such a disappointment.

First, the VR review was great but too complicated. Yes, use your vacuum cleaner to clean out the grinder. Way faster and it also does a better job. But I just put a regular coffee cup under the spout, after filling it with water and giving it two minutes in the microwave to get it good and hot, hit the two cup button and DO NOT FORGET TO EMPTY THE CUP BEFORE PUTTING IT UNDER THE SPOUT--sounds obvious unless you are making coffee at 4 A.M. I add my syrup while steaming the milk. I purge the steamer wand and then just tuck the metal milk cup under it after it starts to steam. Bad timing=some milk splatters, no biggie. Good timing is an early morning victory. Don't walk away from the steamer as you WILL get a big mess. Yes, test the temp of the milk by touching the metal pitcher with your hand. Yes to keeping a terrycloth wash cloth wet and near the machine but I just dampen mine in the sink and put it, folded, under the steamer wand while I am purging it.

Buy your Torani syrups at Sam's Club-----33.8 oz for the price of 12 oz at the supermarket. Now I am looking for an elegant dispenser for the syrup, because..... well, because.

I've tried different beans, exotic to plain, and like Peet's Espresso Blend. The beans grind well and the result is good. I use a very fine grind and have a little spillover which is OK. I am not consistent with the tamping but the only result I find is in a minor change in pressure when brewing, never enough to make a difference and I still get the crema. I think it must be the beans plus the grind more than anything. A knock box is crucial, can't believe it took me a while to buy one. Now I want a fancy tamping box to hold the portafilter in place while tamping, because..... well, because. I bought a little rubber mat that tucks under the front of the machine and that actually works fine.

I ended up doing very little fine tuning once the machine decided to work with me, and I still get absolutely great lattes every single morning, for more than a year now. I just got another place and until I get moved I will be spending time in both places and the first purchase has been another Breville Express. I've researched the other machines and I like the grinder, the lack of turning everything over to a machine (I'd miss that satisfying knock of the filter on the knock box) and I can't imagine more bang for the buck."
4144,1.0,2022-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,Received a broke espresso machine.
4145,5.0,2019-05-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There are two sub-$600 espresso setups commonly recommended for newcomers: The BBE (Or the Infuser+Smart Grinder Pro, which is more or less the same thing) or a Gaggia Classic with PID mod and steam wand replacement and a Sette 270 or similar. I can't speak to the quality of the Gaggia, only to the stress I felt once I started researching what it'd involve (and cost) to source a used machine and appropriate PID kit and wand, break down the machine, and install everything without breaking anything. Meanwhile, the Breville was $480 at Bed Bath & Beyond with their standing 20% off coupon--only $80 more than the Sette on its own.

Simply put, the BBE is a stellar deal, incorporating a deeply thoughtful and consumer-friendly feature set with an all-in-one design that doesn't compromise too much on either the grinder or machine. You save money and counter space, and with one purchase you can be done buying expensive upgrades or accessories for a little while. From the surprisingly solid integrated tamper to the excellent milk jug and thoughtful accessory tray, every detail of the BBE is crafted to get you started quickly and teach you the principles. (And I mean -every- detail. The power cord has a finger hole right by the plug so you don't stress the cable when you unplug the unit. I'm not kidding.)

Cleaning is really very straightforward with a simple descaling process (white vinegar is all you need), thoughtful cleaning tools, and inexpensive cleaning tablets and water filters; by my math, cleaning on the recommended schedule should cost you under $15 a year. The capacious drip tray is easy to empty and clean, and the hidden accessory tray can pack away your spare filter baskets, supplies, and tools with ease.

Are there cons? Sure. The steam wand is a little underpowered, which is great for beginners as you iron your technique out, but may lead to a little toe tapping as you wait the last few seconds for your milk to heat. The lack of a dual boiler also extends your milk frothing time, although the machine comes back up to temperature and pressure extremely quickly between processes thanks to the automatic purge. And of course, it's less easily repairable than machines that come from more cafe-oriented companies like Gaggia, so if something goes badly wrong, you might have issues. (This potential issue is ameliorated by Breville's famously spectacular customer service.) And if you like a bottomless portafilter, you'll have some trouble sourcing an inexpensive one due to the Breville's slightly odd 54mm size.

But, and here's the important thing: once you learn the basics of dialing in a shot, the coffee is spectacular. With the included pressurized baskets, you can even make a serviceable espresso from decaf or preground (!) beans, but with a properly dialed in grind and the nonpressurized baskets, you can easily outclass all but the best third wave coffee shops in your neighborhood, and save yourself proper cash in the process. This isn't a kiddie machine, this is the real deal, and it's the single best option for a single person or family who wants delicious coffee every morning, but isn't looking for a new expensive and demanding hobby. Stop worrying about your equipment, and start working on the fun part: finding your new favorite beans!"
4146,4.0,2019-07-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'll start with the negatives (read on for the positives): as it's been documented on YouTube, the grinder has issues with respect to how it loses effectiveness over time. It's a burr grinder, so I understand that it requires periodic maintenance, which I did follow. However, it will also require some rather ""deep cleaning"" which involves removing some very fiddly bits, including a FELT washer. You read that right - a FELT washer - which if you try to use tweezers to remove (I don't know how you can remove it without), you WILL break it, rendering the machine not really usable. I called their support line. I gave up after one hour the first time. I tried again and used the callback function. They called me two ours later, and as you can see in the screenshot, I've been on the phone for ONE HOUR FOURTY MINUTES afterwards. The actual conversation with the support person took 2 minutes and they promised to ship me the replacement part. The support guy was VERY nice/courteous.

Additionally, I found it super-strange that one of the double walled filters basically disintegrated in half (the 2nd part just fell off). I was really expecting something higher quality than this. I am used to Simonelli and Il Marzocco machines/porta filters and I've never EVER seen this happen - even though these machines are used for making literally tens of thousands of espressos (or more!).

The positives: the grinder is actually pretty damn amazing in terms of what it does for the cost. I bought this machine in large part due to the seemingly excellent grinder, but of course I didn't realize how finicky it will end up being (compared to my Baratza).

The espresso machine comes with unpressurized filters and pressurized as well. I was able to fine tune the grind to use the unpressurized ones, which tasted pretty amazing (due to the placebo of having spent 30 minutes figuring out the correct grind setting/tapping pressure). On the other hand I've never used anything but pressurized filters since, so while it's a nice gimmick, it's not really a must.

So, would I buy this again? Nope. No way. I'd probably stick with a higher end grinder from Bartaza, and a ""real"" espresso machine that does one thing, but does it well. Overall the product is clearly compromised, and while $600 might sound like a lot, it's actually rather a bargain until you start using it and realize that corners had to be cut."
4147,1.0,2019-08-10, Black Sesame, Leaked from the bottom. Tasted awful. Too fussy.
4148,5.0,2019-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the 3rd espresso machine I've owned in my lifetime and definitely my favorite. My previous machine was a Saeco Odea Giro fully automatic. I thoroughly enjoyed that machine until after 6 years, I started having issues with it. It would have cost me $150 to repair it, but I decided to splurge and get a new machine. I love the idea of pushing 3 buttons and bam, there's an espresso in your cup. But the issue I had with the Saeco was the temperature of the espresso. Sometimes i'd have a nice and hot drink, other times it almost felt cold. My friends would sometimes comment too: ""this espresso is a little cold."" Well I had no control over that.
The Breville consistently pours a hot espresso. Love the PID temperature control feature.
In fact, I like all the features of this machine. The water spout is useful even if you don't use it to make drinks. I use it, per Breville's recommendations, to heat up my portafilter and cup. I pour hot water into the cup and it's REALLY hot, then dump it out and place it upside down on the cup warmer tray on top of the machine. It works great to keep the cup warm.
What matters most is the quality of the espresso. It's perfect! On the Saeco fully automatic, the crema was good, but a tan color. On this Breville, the crema seems to have more texture and more of a golden tan color. When I finish the drink, there's still some crema on the side of the cup. I didn't have that with the Saeco. This produces a more pronounced crema. And i'm pulling single shots which is more difficult to produce a nice crema. If I were to pull double shots, i'd probably get a thicker layer. I am using the single wall portafilters. They're not difficult to use, so I don't think you'll need to use the pressurized double wall filters which according to the experts produces a ""fake"" crema, whatever that means. I'm not an espresso snob and some of the negative reviews irked me. Some claim that this machine is a toy and can't compare to some other machines. I'd like to see them in a taste test between a properly pulled espresso shot from this machine and a machine that they prefer. I highly doubt they could tell a difference. I'm Italian and go to Italy every summer to visit my relatives. I have an espresso or two everyday. I honestly cannot tell a difference between the espresso I have had in Italy and the one I have had in my kitchen with this machine.
The reason I give this 5 stars in the ""value"" category is because you get so much more than other machines in this price range. PID temperature control, built-in grinder. The Rancilio Silvio costs more and you have to buy a separate grinder and it doesn't have PID temperature control. And does the Rancilio pull a better shot than this machine? I doubt it. Maybe a professional espresso taster could tell a difference--MAYBE. But I sure wouldn't be able to.
Just one last comment. When I tried to make my first couple espressos per the Breville recommendations, hardly any espresso would drip from the portafilter. This has happened to many people. The solution is when you first get this machine, grind your beans very coarse. Don't use the fine setting as recommended by Breville until you've pulled a few shots. For some reason, this machine can't handle too fine a grind until you've pulled some shots with a coarse grind first. I have no idea why this is. But this was told to me by customer support. Once I pulled a few shots on a coarse grind setting, I dialed it to the fine grind setting and it works fine everytime. I am pulling 27-second shots with the non-pressurized single shot portafilter. Tastes great!
In summary, I don't think I could go back to a fully automatic machine. It's true, the fully automatic was fast to use. 3 buttons to push and no clean up until the spent grinds container got full. But this Breville 870XL only takes 5 minutes from start to finish, including clean up........"
4149,1.0,2015-05-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wish I was able to give a actual review of this product as we have heard and seen good things about this machine. Unfortunately we will never get the chance to give it a try.

I ordered a remanufactured one from the manufacturer directly. We knew it could take a bit of time for it to get to us but after 2 weeks we gave them a call to make sure. We were told it would be shipped by the end of that week. After another week of waiting I gave them another call. Was told again it should leave any day. Needless to say it never came. After another week I gave them a call and found out that they didn't even have my order on file anymore and no record of my payment. I had to then prove I paid for the machine before they would issue me a refund.

As a apology they wanted to give me a discount on ordering another machine. Since we had already ordered another machine from another company they said they would send us some coffee instead. That coffee almost a month later has yet to arrive.

Horrible experience working with Breville."
4150,1.0,2018-03-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wouldn't grind coffee beans properly
4151,4.0,2022-09-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this from BB&B for 20% off, can't beat that price, set up instruction seems pretty good to follow, however, the grinder was giving me a bit of trouble for initial setup where the bean just would not feed through the grinder at all, after 20 minutes of trying to figure out what happen, I decided to jam the cleaning brush from beneath the coffee grinder(where the coffee grind comes out), poke it a few time, then finally the bean fed through just fine now. At first I was pretty skeptical about the grinder, but now I really love it, especially if you are first time espresso machine owner, so the machine will program all the right amount for you, no need to grind the coffee bean separately and not worry about whether it's too much or too less. One big tip I have though....for those people who have REVERSE OSMOSIS water treatment system at home, YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT IN THE FILTER, I have a water ppm measurement at home, my Reverse osmosis reading was 27ppm, but after those water going through the filter, it becomes 200ppm, I decided to take out the filter and check it again, it's only 38ppm without the filter, but of course, if you don't have RO, by all mean use the filter, the filter appears orange inside, anyone know what's inside? I'm not sure what they put in the filter...but it ended up adding more ppm in the good water I have, and I'm not sure how and why, but just today I found 3 ants inside my water tank....really weird...so before you fill in more water, I suggest you check inside the tank thoroughly. I found grind setting 5 with amount dial on 3 o'clock seems to be the most perfect setting for me, pressure comes out good all the time, I found the razor pretty useless, as it just push out more coffee, I think its easier just to even out coffee myself with the tamper. Also, the machine will use water inside the tank to cool down the machine whenever you make a coffee, so don't be alarm to find bunch of water inside the tray. That's all I have, I love this machine though! Definitely recommended for first time espresso owner.
==================================================================================
This review is my second review 6-month later

6 month later, machine is still going strong!!! however, one time I did notice the ""clean me"" button lit up, and I read the manual, it said put in a clean tablet and follow the procedure, so just out of my curiosity, I follow the instruction WITHOUT putting in the tablet, after it did the cleaning process, the light is off now...I'm wondering if the light is just there for the suggestion, and don't really measure whether it needs clean or not? does anyone know? other than that, everything's great, coffee is still good :) *one more tip, different coffee will probably produce different amount of ground regardless of the amount dial, so you might have to readjusted depend on what coffee you have."
4152,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased in December 2018 (4 months ago). This machine has changed my life. I love it! A latte a day keeps me sane :) And I’m loving my morning Americanos and how I can get a good cup of coffee very quickly!

I’ve had two other lower quality espresso machines and didn’t really use them because the outcome never felt worth pulling the machine out and setting it up. This is different—it sits on my counter everyday for constant use.

Before purchasing I was mostly considered about making good foam. I was more than pleasantly surprised by the micro-foam. I can’t tell the difference between the foam I make on this and the foam I used to make on a $10k machine. And yes, you can do latte art.

Espresso is great too. I have my dosage set at 12 o clock and grind size at 10. This has worked for all the espressos I’ve tried. Tip— Target (at least in Southern California) sells Intelligentsia Espresso. It’s wonderful and slightly cheaper than getting beans at a coffee shop.

I can’t imagine having the machine without the grinder ... if you’re back and forth on it, get this one!

So as far as how many drinks can this machine handle... I make anywhere from 3-10 drinks a day with no issues so far. I’ve also brought it along to a few events. At 3 events, I made about 15 drinks back-to-back. At one event, I made over 40 drinks back-to-back. No problems. Had to keep an eye on the water to refill was the only annoying part.

Okay the “downsides” (and I don’t really want to call them that!!!). My biggest surprise (and I don’t know why I didn’t think of this) was that it doesn’t have the ability to pull a shot and steam milk at the same time. I was just used to doing it that way at the coffee shop so I had to adjust a little. It’s ideal if the milk-steaming and shot-pulling can be complete about the same time. How I’ve coped: I prep my shot, steam my milk, and then pull my shot. I chose to do this because espresso shots can go bad if they sit too long. I keep the milk ‘moving’ (swirl frothing pitcher) while the shot is being pulled and this seems to do the trick. The other surprising thing to me was how long it takes to steam the milk. I was used to about a 20-30 second process with a super powerful steam wand. Depending on the amount of milk, it can take 60-90 seconds which feels long. Another reason to steam your milk first! This also causes a longer ‘wait time’ if making drinks back-to-back for others.

What to purchase in addition to the machine:
-tamping mat
-knock box
-water filters (mine did not come with any)
-additional cleaning tabs (came with 2, I used 2 in 4 months.)
-beans roasted for espresso!!

Happy coffee making!
Will update if anything major goes wrong with machine.

UPDATE: Have been using it over a year with no issues. Still loooove it."
4153,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Hey there folks. I've read a few reviews and I don't think I'll even try to add to the great advice and reviews out there. But I can still add a little!

I bought my BES870XL from a competitor on a bit of an impulse purchase. I had fallen down the rabbit hole of ""prosumer"" espresso machines. What initially appeared to involve about a thousand dollar expense quickly became $3-4k for machine AND grinder. Then a friend invested well over $3k for the whole shebang (a real beaut of a machine, quality grinder, all the accessories AND a gram scale. A gram scale! Sorry, not THAT into it!)

I've been making home espresso (lattes) for almost thirty years. Went to school in Berkeley, so have a well-developed dependency on good espresso (Traveling can really suck; why do so many ""baristas"" burn milk and a make such crap? And for camping, I have a camp-stove double-boiler espresso machine, so I enjoy lattes ANYWHERE!) Anyway, I've been limping along lately using a total piece of crap machine. A trip to Moab two years ago saw me running a commercial machine for my morning java and boy was THAT a wonderful experience. I was ready to finally take the leap.

So here I've been just wanting that cafe-level machine experience, but not at a lifestyles of the rich & famous ""$100k kitchen remodel"" price. Well, I definitely found it in the Breville BES78XL. The impulse purchase was quickly confirmed as not a totally stupid purchase by being a SCG's ""Staff pick."" And the grinder does its magic (WAY better than the pile-o-crap Cuisinart burr grinder from Costco) The results couldn't be better in my opinion. The crema is so good that I use a spatula to get every last molecule out of my cup.

One thing I found helps: as the grinder is dispensing into your portafilter, tap the black handle left and right gently (but with a jolt) to get the grounds to evenly fill your basket, preventing voids and, more importantly, reduce the amount of spillover. I also cup my hand below the portafilter to catch the extra and add it to my little ""grinds mountain"" before tamping. This has greatly reduced the waste I was initially experiencing.

BTW, I've been playing with fire as far as beans go. As I said, I've enjoyed quality espresso for a long time. However, I'm finding my taste changing a bit. I ""came of age"" on the deeply roasted French and Espresso beans (aka ""burnt""). The Moab trip definitely clued me into quality, but lighter roasts (Thanks Bob!). But I find the typical high-end espresso shop's (Blue Bottle, Olympia, etc.) espresso is a bit too mellow. Long story short (yeah, right!), I'm MIXING my beans now! I'm sure I'll be attacked from all sides by the true pros out there, but I'm finding I can customize my flavor (and caffeine dose) by mixing (still can't handle high octane because I drink a quad latte). I've been mixing reg and decaf Dark French for years now. Well, I'm now adding light roast to the mix and loving it. Cool thing is when I first added the lighter beans (about 1/3), my extraction pressures hit the sweet spot virtually EVERY time. So live a little and mix it up folks!

Now my main concern is longevity. I pull 4-7 oz. of espresso each morning for my two 16 oz. lattes. I hope this machine can take the daily workout. Luckily I enjoy soft, Sierra water, so I'm hoping the supplied filters and cleaning tablets keep things rolling for years to come.

Good luck and enjoy this machine.

PS Forgot to add that I'm using the double-shot, single-wall basket exclusively. Haven't even tried the double-wall basket(s) and am very happy that I haven't needed them."
4154,1.0,2018-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,After 1 year broken
4155,4.0,2022-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"tl;dr: About the best you can get at a non-commercial grade under $1000. NON-EXISTENT support in the USA when it breaks, which is irritating, at the very least considering it's still a $600 product (plus tax).

I bought this in the fall of 2016 and put it through its paces. I had owned cheap espresso machines before ($30-40 range), and they're just not made to stand up to daily use. So I did my research prior to buying this, and (as of 2016) this was the least expensive, most performant piece of hardware you could get before you were forced to step up to a commercial grade appliance, to the tune of at least $1500, $2000.

Getting the bean type, grinding coarseness and amount per serving takes some trial and error (unless you're a chemist), but once you do, its pretty reliable. I wouldn't say I was a power user - I wasn't pulling 25 shots a day for commercial use. But, I was using this on average, twice a day (I work from home). The steaming wand works pretty well assuming you keep it clean after each use. Descaling and cleaning is pretty easy, though you may need to clean out the water reservoir with cleaning vinegar depending on your local water supply.

Unfortunately, several weeks ago, as I was thinking to myself how reliable this machine had been, I heard a loud bang and whole thing shorted out to the GFI outlet. The grinder still works, but any time you try and activate the boiler, the whole thing shorts out. I broke even on buying lattes and cortado's in coffee shops long ago, and I'm OK with something last 3.5 years with daily use like this.

The biggest problem here is that there's not much customer support/repair presence for Breville USA. I couldn't even get someone on the phone, and when I did, she hung up on me after rudely quizzing me on what timezone I was in (the website said they were within their hours of customer support, but she claimed they weren't), not understanding it was where their office was, not me? After trying a full 2 weeks after, I could not get a single person on the phone to even ASK about repair options. There seem to be some independent contractors out there handling repairs, but it would be stellar if Breville refer me to someone."
4156,1.0,2018-07-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,This coffee machine is great until it’s not. Eventually it will stop grinding coffee.
4157,1.0,2018-09-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bad! Bad! Bad!
Nothing performs as advertised, frother hardly puts out any steam, no matter the calibration of the grind and amount thereof produced any espresso not to mention any ""crema""
Utterly disappointing"
4158,5.0,2020-04-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I shuddered when I told my husband I wanted to drop $500 on an espresso machine. It sounded pretty stupid when I said it out loud, and it's not something I prefer to admit when people ask my how much I paid for it (though I did manage to find it for $420). However, it really is worth it. I paid less than $200 for a decent DeLonghi machine eight years ago. No matter what I did, I couldn't make a latte that tasted as good as one at Starbucks (and yes, I know I was setting the bar low there). Plus, it took forever to to steam the milk and it always got way too frothy. It broke last month and I invested in the lovely red version of the Breville Barista Express.

Now, my lattes far surpass anything I've ever had at Starbucks. They taste as good as or better than any latte I've had anywhere, including the ones from a few iconic cafes I've visited in my travels. I cannot comment on the flavor of my espresso shots because I don't drink straight espresso. However, I can actually texture my milk now. I didn't understand quite what that meant before. It's not hot milk with a ton of froth on top; the milk is evenly thick and textured throughout, and yes, you can even learn how to do latte art if you so desire. The burr grinder is fantastic. I never have to deal with uneven grounds and cleaning out clumps of coffee from my cheap grinder again! Also, my old machine took 10-15 minutes to heat up. This one takes a few seconds, so you don't have to remember to go into the kitchen and preheat it.

A word of warning: there is a steep learning curve when using this machine properly. You can do it the simple way and use the the double walled filter, or you can invest some time, read the instructions, experiment with the single walled filter, and manually program your machine properly. I made about 15 different lattes the first day before I got them just right. I had to change the setting for how course/fine the grind is, change the setting for how may beans actually get dispensed, and most importantly, change the setting for how much water comes out. The factory setting for the water was producing less than half an ounce of espresso, but there is a way to change that. Now, my shots are a little under an ounce. Here are a few tips:
1) Freshly roasted beans from a local roaster really DO make a difference. Buy beans that have a ""roasted on"" date within the last few weeks, not beans that have a ""Sell by"" date.
2) A latte made from the single walled, single shot filter will taste far better than one made from either the single walled or double walled double shot filters. When I make a double latte, I make two separate shots, and I even texture half the milk and then the other half separately. Maybe I just haven't gotten good enough at it yet, but the milk doesen't texture as well when I do more than 5-6 ounces at a time.
3) If possible, pull your shots directly into the your cup and then add the milk, as opposed to using espresso shot glasses. You will lose crema in the transfer. I have to use a shot glass during the week because I use a travel mug, but on the weekends, I pull my shots directly into my mug.
4) When the coffee is dispensing into the filter, wiggle the handle back and forth for a more even distribution of grounds. I saw this on a couple of youtube videos and it works well.
5) Make sure you have the space for it. If I put it directly under my cabinets, I cannot pull the water tank out. I have it sitting flush with edge of my counter and the water tank just barely clears my cabinet. It is very heavy and isn't something you will want to be moving forward and backward on your countertop."
4159,5.0,2013-10-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pulls a very decent shot for the money. Perhaps somewhere in between a good Nespresso unit and an artisanal Italian cafe espresso. I am surprised how “sensitive” and exact this well-engineered espresso grinder & maker is- you should practice and learn the nuances of how to pull a good tasty shot and this machine will let you know if you’re doing it right (with the gauge & general pour timing & flow). Recommend!
12/20/2019- UPDATE. I just realized that for the past 5 months of almost daily use, my water extraction & dispenser temperature is BELOW standard. This machine should produce near or at 200 degrees Fahrenheit and all this time, my Breville Barista has been pulling shots between 171-173 degrees. That's over 25 degrees UNDER ideal espresso shot pulling. I've tested every other possibility / probability as to why my coffee seemed to be missing some flavor profiles and naturally, as luck would have it, I find out at the tail end of all my tests.
Since I cannot alter the manufactured settings, I am now in contact with Breville Customer Support for a viable solution. I am hopeful they will either replace this machine with a new one that can produce a closer to a 200 degree temperature extraction. If you purchased a Breville recently, invest in a $25 ThermaPro digital temperature gauge to make sure your machine produces proper temperature for maximum coffee results (plus, you can properly roast, grill, heat, and measure your cooked foods properly ;-)).
Everything else on my Breville works wonderful and as expected. Note: If you need to contact Breville Customer Support, my experience has ALWAYS ""experiencing a high call volume"" so expect to wait, or be called back about 45 minutes later. After you get them on the line, they're very capable, experienced, and helpful people.
I just wished I tested water temp first, instead of trying every other controllable variable. I shall keep you all posted on the end result. Cheers.

01/01/19 I had the pleasure to correspond with M. Ochoa from Breville Customer Support. After following instructions on multiple temperature tests to determine that the heating system was not up to factory standards, he offered to exchange my machine for a new one. I received my replacement unit within 10 days (over Christmas holidays too!) and this unit works much better now. I'm able to produce hotter & fuller tasting coffee shots with the same batches of freshly roasted coffee beans. It is a happy new year now!
Hopefully this replacement machine will continue to pull great shots for years to come. When I'm ready to graduate to a higher level coffee maker, in a year or two, I will definitely include and highly consider Breville in my purchase decision.
2/22/21.... STILL, a Breville Barista fan. Machine is going strong! This machine's consistency and quality build, at their selling price, make this a true value."
4160,1.0,2018-09-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My machine only worked a few times, and then the compressor broke down."
4161,1.0,2018-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,A very expensive piece of junk. It's now an expensive paper weight.
4162,4.0,2021-07-28, Black Sesame,"OK, so after having and using this machine for about 2 months I can finally give my input. I'm a neophyte espresso maker. Before getting this machine I was quite happy with my tried and true stove-top Moka. But i craved the unique sweet, bitter, acid flavor of true espresso. After tons of research, this machine had everything I needed/wanted: Grinder, ability to customize your coffee and a steamer. Plus, it's a really nice looking machine.

I like to think I'm a pretty smart guy, but omg, it took me about 5 days to figure out how to get a drinkable, let alone delicious, espresso. What the heck was I doing wrong? Well, nothing really, just that every bean is a little different and you really need to fuss with the grind size/amount controls to get the best possible combination for the bean you're using. Plus, the instructions say to tamp with 30 lbs. of pressure. What the heck is 30 lbs. of pressure? Anyway I went online and looked at videos, read about the machine and finally figured it out. Now I can get a pretty darn consistent delicious espresso every time. I've gotten used to the fact that with each new bean I try it will be a matter of trial and error to pull the perfect shot.

PROS -
Beautiful design
Hot water option for teas is great
Once you figure it out, espresso is delicious
Grinder is great to have and works fine
Price is right

CONS
It really took a while to figure out how to pull a good shot
Although cleaning is easy, I was a little surprised how often machine asks me to clean it with the tablets (about once every 2 weeks)
This may just be me but it seems that when I make a latte or cappuccino it gets cold a little quickly, even though cup is pre-heated and textured milk seems hot enough
Water tank is plastic and seems a little cheap, but I guess for the price, not so bad

TIPS
Be patient!
Don't use the single shot filter baskets or the dual wall one. Stick to the double shot filter basket. After lots of research I learned that it's easier and you'll get more consistent results to make double shots.
If pressure needle is the right spot (grey area) you'll pretty much get a dang good shot"
4163,2.0,2017-04-12, Black Sesame,Good while it worked but just quit working…had just over a year….$700….really?
4164,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,"After 4+ years of daily use I still love this machine! I enjoy an occasional espresso shot, but mostly just make a cup (Americano). The flavor is superior to a drip coffee maker (we have one in our camper). It can take a little tweaking at first, but that is the beauty and quality of this unit. I love the built in burr grinder and the adjustable grind control. Beans vary and when changing coffee you do have to do some fine tuning. And when you first start brewing you have to fine tune to get your grind perfect for a good shot. It has jammed on me once, but it is pretty simple to disassemble from the top and it was a small stone jammed in the grinder. Came out easy enough and have had no problems since. The dial in grind amount doesn’t seem to work like it used to. But it is easy to add grinder coffee with push button and not a big deal to me. Pretty simple to clean and descale and auto light lets you know when to clean. Quality porta filters and a nice steamer for the price point. If you like lattes, this unit will do a great job steaming the milk. Overall I think this is the best unit in its price range. I use an auto 1 shot machine at work that runs about $1200 and the breville makes just as good if not better shot. The hot water feature is great too. Comes out really hot, really fast warm up time (about 30 sec). So if you want tea it’s simple and fast. The gauge is another great feature in this price point. It’s a must for dialing in a real shot and after you get comfortable with tuning your bean grind, amount of coffee, and pressure, it’s pretty quick and enjoyable. The replacement filter in the water container is another nice feature. The color started wearing off the front of the tray after a couple years. Overall it takes up a pretty small footprint and looks great on the counter. I will add if your thinking of getting a cheaper machine with no grinder, just remember it takes a burr grinder to get a fine espresso grind. A decent grinder is $180 and up. That’s what sold me on this unit when I was researching. There’s some other features and adjustments I left out. There’s plenty of reviews and instruction on YouTube. I will add that with my most commonly used coffee beans I don’t really have to reset or adjust anything."

They didn't care and told me I only have 90 days of free service and it is not returnable or replaceable.
I wasted my money on this machine and going to Gaggia brand after many recommendations."
4174,5.0,2018-04-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"SECOND UPDATE: After owning it for four months I really can't give this anything other than 5 stars. Once you get used to feeling out what makes a good shot, it's almost 100% reliable. I drink espresso every morning-- which I never used to do-- and it still gives me great joy to use. And-- I use the dedicated hot water disputer A LOT (for herbal tea). So: not a four star review, clearly a five. No regrets. (One update: ""8"" seems to be the magical setting for darker roasts; lighter roasts need a coarser grind like ""12"".)

UPDATE: Since getting this machine about two weeks ago, I've gotten more used to its quirks and have become more successful with pulling shots. It still takes a bit of tweaking to get it just right, but overall I like it.

ORIGINAL: I was ready for a higher-grade espresso machine and found myself on the fence between the Breville Duo Temp Pro (about $400) and the Barista Express (about $600). The Breville 800ESXL is also about $400 and LOOKS like the Barista Express, but it's a ThermoBlock rather than Thermocoil, so really the Duo Temp Pro and the Barista Express have more in common with each other than either does with the 800ESXL.

I initially purchased the Duo Temp Pro, and reviewed it here (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EP0MIXO0V8V8/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OS5MTCA). I really liked it, especially once I got the grind right. However, I realized I would need a new burr grinder anyway and I liked the idea of playing with the pressure gauge, so I picked up the Barista Express and played with it. Here's my experience:

1) First shot: single shot double-walled basket, grinder set at ""4"", medium pressure tamp. Came out over-pressured, bitter and over-extracted; a fail. Thrown out.

2) Second shot: single shot, grinder set at ""8"", medium pressure tamp. Same result! Over-pressured, bitter and over-extracted; a fail. Interestingly, the grinder goes from ""1"" to ""16""-- I'm now at the halfway point and it appears too FINE for the machine can handle… is that good? (Thrown out.)

3) Third shot: single shot, grinder set at ""12"", medium pressure tamp. Success, though on the low end of the ""espresso range"" pressure. Good crema, good taste, though still a little bitter-- possibly because of the beans.

4) Fourth shot: single shot, grinder set back at ""8"", medium pressure tamp. Low end of the pressure gauge-- what??-- but REALLY GOOD. Excellent crema, smooth delicious taste, less bitter… but now I'm confused! POSSIBLY there is grinds of the previous setting pre-queued in the grinder… otherwise how am I getting the same result as #2? Strange…

5) Fifth shot (and now waking up…): single shot, grinder set down to ""6"", medium pressure tamp. Same exact result. Great espresso, great crema, though JUST within the ""espresso range"". I guess since it's producing good espresso that I shouldn't care? Hmmmmm.

6) Sixth shot: SINGLE-walled basket, grinder set down to ""6"", medium pressure tamp. Now UNDEREXTRACTED; doesn't enter espresso range, and comes out with little crema. So I guess you need to grind FINER and/or harder tamp with single-walled basket? (Maybe this is in the instruction manual… mine was missing!) Thrown out.

7) Seventh shot (I wanted to get one right!): single-walled basket, grinder at ""4"", medium-hard pressure tamp. Good crema, good taste, but STILL doesn't enter espresso range! (Just under.) This now seems harder than what I experienced with the Duo-Temp Pro… but I'm still motivated to play with the tamp/grind to get it right.

So I have to stop drinking espresso now! Short version, at this point: good machine, but get a pound of good quality beans and be prepared for some missed shots initially. In DO like the hot water dispenser and the ""dry puck"" feature; it's easier to pre-heat cups and I can expel a puck by just overturning the basket and giving a shake. Neither are essential, however. The grinder seems great; I'm still ambivalent on the pressure gauge, because I haven't been able to successfully get one right in the middle! So it seems a bit temperamental, but I'm still motivated to keep playing with it and see what the ""ideal"" shot seems like. Stay tuned."
4175,4.0,2017-07-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine 4 days ago and so far so good. I'm an enthusiastic latte drinker and this is my first real espresso machine. Thus far it makes pretty good espresso. I'm pretty happy with it so far. I'll list some of the pros and cons I've noticed so far:

Pros:
It's easy to use and user friendly. It feels like they've kept the amateur in mind and helps to control for some user errors. It makes a decent espresso (bear in mind I am not that experienced in making it, only drinking it). The steamer froths pretty good considering I have zero real world experience frothing milk. The parts are nicely organized for ease of use.

Cons:
It's easy to clean but most of my time is spent doing the required cleaning after each use. I do not think you can buy a larger portafilter. So if you're like me and want 3 or more shots you'll have to do this whole process twice. Also, you need to warm the machine up a good 15 minutes before using. That's no trouble for me as I can turn it on and go about my morning routine. The drip tray can fill up quickly from steaming and pulling shots. So you'll want to keep an eye on that. Sometimes the tray they built to keep the extra tools can get wet due to its placement. It's not too bad, but just fyi.

Other than that, I've really enjoyed this machine and the drinks I've been able to produce with little experience at making them. I've not felt like I'm missing anything from cutting out my daily morning coffee house run (and I'm fairly picky).

I'll come back in a few months and report any new information I find.

Edit: I've now owned this machine for over a year and I have to say I still enjoy it and use it often. I am relgious about keeping it cleaned. Thus far everything is still working properly and I've had no issues. I'm still please with this purchase."

4180,5.0,2019-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I debated on buying this for the longest time and I’m so happy that I did. I highly recommend watching videos ahead of time on how to properly dial in the grinder to make set up easier. It’s a beautiful looking machine that adds to the overall look of any kitchen.
4181,1.0,2017-05-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Product arrived used!! So gross. Very disappointed.
4182,4.0,2016-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you've opened up the box and become completely lost and confused, do this immediately to reassure yourself that your 5 and a half benjamins were well spent:

1. Press-fit the 1 cup dual-wall filter into the portafilter.
2. Fill it with 2 tablespoons of good store-bought ground coffee (regular drip-coffee sized grind).
3. Tamp it as best as you can (it won't tamp down all the way, but that's ok).
4. Remove any excess with the razor tool.
5. Extract and enjoy your faux-spresso!

The faux-spresso will smell and taste amazing, much better than 99% of the coffee bar espressos out there.

The problem is making real espresso with the single wall filters (which relies on the coffee grinds instead of the filter to build pressure). In short, it is really quite tough.

First, the built-in grinder is quite fickle: it grinds a little too fine, so the default setting of 5 is way too fine. The larger the number the coarser the grind, so try setting to 11 or 13. The grinder also doesn't correctly output twice the amount of grind for double shots, so you'll have to grind 1 shot, and then another shot separately into the same portafilter if that is what you want.

Second, even with PID, the water runs a little too cool through the pressure drop. So even if you dial in the grind size and extraction time correctly (about 30 seconds), the extraction will be sour. The unit does allow you to increase the heat to a max of 4 degrees, but reading and understanding the temperature is a little counter-intuitive. Since it doesn't have an LCD display, it relies on using the button lights to indicate the temperature. More importantly it won't tell you what the temperature is at the time of extraction, so that is somewhat on faith.

I have experimented through half a bag of Lavazza Caffe Espresso beans and have yet to pull a well balanced shot. In the meantime, the faux-spresso sustains my soul."
4183,5.0,2018-12-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"OK, I did not purchase this from Amazon as I would not be home when it was going to be delivered and didnt want a porch pirate taking it. I price matched it at a local ""big Chain"" retail store. (Boy were they mad Amazon had it priced so low!)

I love a good cappuccino, but have refused to go to the ""big coffee"" coffee shop on every street corner because of their overall beliefs and values. That and $5 for a cup of coffee is outrageous. I have owned a few cheap (under $75) espresso makers that left me bored and only made an average shot.

THis machine is the real deal. It heats up quickly and is ready to go. It comes with just about everything you need (sans the beans and milk!) to get started quickly. A perfect sized aluminum pitcher for frothing milk. A steam wand that does the job quickly and artfully. A adjustable grinder that really does a good job. 54mm tamper to pack those grounds with a convenient magnetic storage to keep it where it needs to be, not rolling around a kitchen drawer. Single and double wall filters in single and double shot doses! Cleaning equipment. Tablets for cleaning. It's all here.

I suggest watching a few videos or reading a few tutorials on line to get the hang of pulling a good shot of espresso first. THe instruction book was OK but not great. Did not go into a lot of technique and tips on pulling a good shot or frothing milk. A quick search on line though will show dozens of easy to follow videos on both topics.

This machine makes devine shots for espresso, Americanos, lattes etc. Plenty of power for frothing milk. So far its pretty easy. I'll update in a few weeks when the first cleaning cycle comes up. Again the instructions are a bit muddled, but I'm sure once I get into it, it will make sense.

This machine goes through a lot of water. I find myself refilling it often. I'm guessing steam uses more water than I anticipated. Large reservoir tank in the back that slides in easily, so it is not awkward to install.

Overall, I am very happy with this product. Read some of the other longer reviews here to get tips on grind size etc. I set mine to 3. I also grind one shot at a time, even if making a double shot. I also ordered a set of kitchen rags just for this machine as its very handy to have a few nearby to clean up and wipe down the steam arm.

If you are a coffee lover, this is the machine to get. All reviews show for the home user, this one is the best."

4185,5.0,2017-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This would be definitely one of the top 5 things I have ever bought. I was dreaming about good espresso for years. First I saw the Nespresso of Nestle is the best thing because they have really good capsule choices but over the time the capsules would be really expensive and the coffee there is pre-grounded for long time. I have read tons of reviews and many times ended up at the Breville line. But $547.00 seamed to me way too much. Then I saw that the top of the line espresso machines are somewhere around $3,000 which is totally out of even thinking about. I knew that there is simply impossible to make great machine around $200 when the top of the line is around $3k. So. I closed my eyes and pressed the one click purchase button. Every time I use this machine I am really happy that I was brave enough to risk over $500 because the coffee I am getting is very close to Starbucks quality. Well. I mean when Starbucks used to make great coffee what is lately happening very rarely. The time they made a Vente Cappuccino with milk foam two time frosted are over. I was really tired of explaining Starbuck's baristas that I want totally dry coffee with foam only. It usually took me one or two returns before I got what I wanted. With Breville I don't have a rush when I go to the store that I will have to fight again over and over to get good product as the old Starbucks used to do all the time because I can make it by myself exactly as I like it. Here are couple tips:
1/ Read the instructions really carefully and then go to YouTube and watch couple time how exactly to use this machine. There are little details which makes huge difference. (pre-warming the machine, pre-warming the cups ....)
2/ Grinder is extremely important part of the whole process. I saw reviews saying that good grinder is more important then the espresso machine itself and after my experiences have to say that that is really true. The great thing is that the grinder is included in the system and you don't have to pay $300 separately for good grinder.
3/ I love French dark roast coffee but after some tests found out that for espresso the medium roast is the best. When I was using the dark roast I set the grinder to position number 4 but with the medium roast the 7 or 8 is the best. Read the instruction to see what the difference means.
We have been using this product for more than 2 months every day and the results a better and better as we experiment with different grinder levels and different kinds of coffee. We will see how long this machine lasts because that would be the only fear I have. The quality of the coffee is outstanding and we will see what the reliability is. So far extremely good!."

4187,1.0,2015-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this at Williams-Sonoma today. After one cup of espresso, the grinder jammed. I followed the instructions in the box, and it still jammed. Unfortunately, when that happens, there is no good way to fix it, as the grinder is screwed into the machine itself. I could take it apart, but for $700+, I don't want to deal with it. So I took it back to WS. I don't recommend it."

4190,1.0,2019-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Sorry but there's NO WAY my food is being cooked in plastic. Hot steam forced through plastic - NO THANK YOU. Breville can call it safe all they want, but from some one with an autoimmune disease I encourage you all to research all plastic no matter how safe anybody claims it to be. Breville used to sell this with an entirely stainless steel portafilter. Obviously they're saving money using plastic now."
4191,5.0,2019-05-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Here's the deal... This is not an automatic machine. By this, I mean, you must put in time, effort, and patience in order to get your perfect shot. I was a daily coffee shop drinker for years. Spent thousands of dollars a year in drinks. Like everyone here, did a quick cost benefit analysis and decided to pony up the cash up front, and I don't regret it one bit. I will tell you a secret - I bought this machine twice. The first time, I bought it and couldn't figure out how to pull a damn shot. No cream, bitter or extremely tannic, crap. Note that I did not have the patience at first. So I returned and bought a fully automatic, the DeLonghi Magnifica. This machine pumped out a shot with little effort. Completely plastic machine unlike the Breville. And zero fun I might add. I could taste the plastic in the DeLonghi shots. So back it went and, after researching another solution, I read that most people who got the hang of the Breville semi loved it. So I bought it again. I went through an entire bag of beans figuring out the right combo but once I did I now consider myself a pro. I actually crave my own shots over coffee shops! Few tips...
- Read the freaking directions people. Seriously. Especially that one page insert Breville includes. I just have referenced that 50 times while experimenting.
- CLEAN THE MACHINE. I use filtered water, and clean using express machine tablets AND descale/deljme every time the ""clean me"" light comes on. Yes it's work. It takes about 20 minutes and no one wants to use it blah blah blah. But, if you want a clean machine inside and out, this is a must. (a note of importance, the guts of the Breville are stainless steel. This is an often overlooked quality that should be considered. Unless you like to taste plastic).
- Experiment with different beans. I have had great luck with Lavazza super crema, top bean. If your beans are not roasted properly for espresso / too oily, then your grinder will clog yo. This is not a manufacturer issue. This is your mistake. I committed this error with Starbucks (gasp) espresso beans and my grinder was cloggy mc-cloggington. So choose beans wisely.
- If you chose poorly, follow the instructions and clean out the burr grinder. Run some rice through that s***. Good as new.
- Some people complain about water in frother. I can't comment on this because I'm not watching the frother. I use the pitcher it came with to froth my whole milk, and it comes out lovely and silky and hot.

I've had this machine over two years and it's still going strong! Give it a try and save some money. If you're anything like me, you will actually enjoy the 5 mins it takes to pull a shot and begin looking forward to mornings for a change."

4195,5.0,2021-10-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I recently graduated from Nespresso to Breville 870XL so I write this review for those who are deciding between this, Nespresso, and other options out there.

I got into espresso based drinks about 10 years ago. My first espresso maker was an original Bialetti espresso maker. I was happy with it for a week but the coffee coming out of it always tasted horrible. In 2011, after a ton of research I bought Nespresso CitiZ and Milk. That machine is still working fine, just the milk frother died a few months ago (which is not a big deal). I have been making at least 2 cappuccinos daily. That means I have paid a lot of money (probably more than $3000) for capsules since then. So do not let the price of device deceive you when you are making a decision. On the other hand, Nespresso devices are very easy to use and takes no time to make a good espresso or cappuccino. Nespresso has changed a lot since 2011. They have introduced a ton of machines since then, some of which seems not to have the quality of the original ones. There has been a lot of changes in their capsule lineup as well. My favorite, Inrdiya from India (and few others) were recently discontinued and replaced with some crap ones. The prices are going up too (costing you at least 80 cents per capsule compared to about 20-25 cents when you make it from beans). So It was time for graduating from Nespresso to a real machine. There are zillions of classical espresso makers out there ranging anywhere from $100 to thousands. The question is which one is a good balance of price and quality. I have tested/tasted the coffee from many devices (Saeco, Krups, fully automated ones). I have not seen any device below Breville 870XL that makes a decent espresso. If you want a decent espresso from beans, Breville 870 seems to be the cheapest device that makes that and has a good quality. A main issue with these classical espresso machines is that they typically break faster than Nespresso (they are more complicated). This one has been on the market for a couple of years and seems to be relatively reliable. The last question is what if you have a ton of money and you are tempted to buy a fully automatic one? I have seen those break a lot, so if you are reading this review, you probably care about how you are investing your money. If you really want something simple, get Nespresso now and then may be in the future you decide to graduate to something like this.

I bought this from BedBathandBeyond for $480. Good deal!"
4196,5.0,2019-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel," Take the time to read and learn. This machine is very sensitive until you understand the balance Between grind, tamp, and amount of coffee.
I love it."
4197,4.0,2018-04-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE: After a few more months of use, my husband and I are much more comfortable with the ins and outs of using this machine. We don't waste as many coffee beans as we used to, and when we do it's usually because we just opened a new bag of beans and need to adjust the grind. The espresso is great. While I do still wish there was some kind of low-water indicator on the front, we moved the machine so we can more easily check the level in the reservoir before use.

My only other complaint is that the light indicator for descaling the machine came on and stayed on for WEEKS. No matter how many times I followed the instructions in the manual, it didn't turn off the light. I tried following steps in a few YouTube videos instructing how to descale. No change. Eventually I found a forum post where someone had had the same issue and contacted the manufacturer. This person shared the instructions he was given by the manufacturer, and when I tried them, it worked! The light turned off! It was REALLY frustrating that the instructions in the manual for this machine don't actually work to turn off the indicator light when it's done descaling.

But seriously. The espresso is great. Upping my star rating from 3 to 4.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: When it works correctly, it's fantastic. It's very finicky, and sometimes we can't figure out why it doesn't brew properly. Other times we realize that the water reservoir is low, so we refill it and try again until it works. I wish it had some kind of low water indicator on the front of the machine since you can't see the reservoir from the front. We have wasted a lot of coffee beans in this machine."

4200,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"3 years of ownership:

My machine is still trucking. There are some random leaks that I am unsure of the origin. Its not steady and I keep a towel under the machine so its not an overwhelming problem. It still works well and I have not had to contact customer service for anything since I did 2 or so years ago. That may be a testament in itself. The shot is not 100% consistent as in the amount for a single and double varies slightly each time. A number of things can possibly contribute to this, but it still pulls a solid shot in my opinion. Can recommend based on my several years of ownership and will update to 4 out of 5.

Update 4 Months Later:

I experimented with 2 other machines and ended up coming back to this one. All of the cons I mentioned below are just routine now, now that I have been using it everyday for the past 4 months. All of that said, this review is going to remain 3 stars because of the absent, stunted, and useless customer service. You guys--its so bad. There are a lot of reviews here that reference the poor customer service from Breville, and its true. ITS ALL TRUE. You contact these guys, adding all of your model information and issues, and they respond to you 3 days later with a template response that includes answers to questions you mentioned in your initial email. The endless stupid back and forth begins. It Is The Worse. So if something happens to your machine, or you have questions, your best bet is to post your question here on this page cause Breville Customer Service is absolute crap.

Not a coffee snob, but I enjoy good coffee, and know what it takes to make a great cup. I like this machine. I dont mind that its a little finicky. Upon receiving it, it took me a good hour and some change of trial and error to get the grind/ grind amount right and now it pretty much makes a perfect cup. I use a variety of espresso from roasters all over the world and have had to adjust the grind etc..only slightly to get a perfect cup. All of this is ok with me.

At first I wanted the Delonghi super automatic machine because I have limited time in the morning and was thinking it would be great to have something that did pretty much everything for me. But I also didnt want to personally take the process out of the process ya know, so I went with this one. Its a beautiful machine for sure. I have had no problems with the grinder and I like the ease of setting my own personal preferences for the length of the shot.

The few things I do not like about it that I find enough of a deal breaker that I will keep looking for another machine.

--I do not like that the water tank is in the back. Like most, I have this sitting under a cabinet. I have enough clearance between the cabinet and the machine that I can easily fit my mug up there but I can not lift this water tank out to fill it. So I have to either shift the machine around to get the tank out or I fill up my large water bottle and transfer. Also because of the placement I Have to LOOK for the water level instead of it just being visible while facing the machine and working on it. This is annoying.

--Clean up. There is the drip tray that has multiple parts. When it gets full enough a little yellow sign pops up to empty it. You are supposed to take the whole drip tray out I believe and empty/clean it. But every time I take out the drip tray, before it gets overly full, I find pockets of water under the drip tray. At first I summed this up to my probably just spilling a little water upon emptying it the first few times, but then after cleaning the area up and running the machine over a day or two, I went to look under the drip tray well before the ""Empty Me"" flag popped up to see if there was any water, and there was again pockets of water under the drip tray. Not drops here and there, but pockets of water. I find this problematic and this contributes to unnecessary clean up.

--The steam wand. I personally think this steamer takes too long to get started. My $80 Delonghi machine I had for almost 2 years got started almost immediately. Curious why this machines steam wand takes so long to get up and running. Maybe some mechanics behind that it that i probably dont understand, but personally I find it takes longer than im used to to steam.

These are little things, but enough of a deal breaker for me. It has a 1 year limited warranty and the not so good stories about repairs post warranty, is another reason I am returning this machine. I read hundreds of the thoughtfully written reviews and no one had anything good to say about the Breville Warranty service. For the $$ spent on this, I need a little more security. When my little cheapo Delonghi started leaking randomly, I contacted Delonghi, and they sent me a new machine that day and I received it the next day. Literally the next day I had a new machine. No try this or try that, they just sent me a new machine and despite its little nuances, it worked fine for the 2 years I had it. I need that kind of security for this kind of purchase and it doesn't seem like Ill get it according to other reviews so I am going to keep looking."
4201,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"NOT working at all

I am thinking in returning

By the way awesome look"
4202,4.0,2015-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Only 2nd day owning the 870 and I am very impressed. Build quality is great and the machine makes fantastic espresso. My first shots (about 15) were just perfect with awesome crema. I was a bit worried by the negative reviews but I am glad I took the plunge. The shots this machine is capable of producing are amazing. Just buy fresh beans, adjust your tamping according to your grind level and you will pull a perfect shot every time !!! Very happy so far. I will update this review once I get more millage out of my Breville 870XL.

Update (12/07/2014): Still pulling out great shots. No issues except I am exceeding the pressure capability of the pump - I tamp my coffee pretty well and that hits the high end of the pressure gauge. Sometimes the needle starts to swing up and down as the pump is trying to maintain the high pressure. I still get amazing shots but I would have liked a stronger pump to handle my tamping without the hesitation. Overall, I am very happy with my Breville. Just remember, you need good beans to make good espresso.

Update (2/16/2018) Still going strong and making fantastic espresso but only after I made some repairs. Grind was getting too coarse and the push switch was not engaging - I had to open the machine and fix the switch. It was no longer being pushed all the way to the click spot. I glued a piece of cloth so the pusher would protrude enough to make it work when I push the portafilter. Since I had the machine open, I decided to try and fix the grind issue. I was lucky I did - I pulled it out and was able to make a couple of turns beyond what the lock allows. This adjustment gave me way more control over the grind size - now it can make a super fine grind when I need it. Why is it important? Because some beans are very dry and there is no way you can pull anything other than a glass of water. So with this improvement, I can work with any type of bean. It's awesome because I was about to throw the machine out but now I am keeping it and it makes even better espresso."
4203,5.0,2015-04-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Here are the things I have done with this machine to greatly improve shots.
1. Do a google search as to modifying the grinder to grind finer. The machine as is does not grind fine enough.
2. Get a 54 mm funnel for the portafilter.
3 get a scale to weigh your beans going in and your shot going out.
Here is what I do...
Weigh out 20.5 gms of beans, grind into a 8 oz yogurt cup ( or any cup that will fit). Remove ground coffee from the cup to get 20 grams. Using the 54 mm funnel in the portafilter, pour the ground coffee in. Use the tamp to evenly push the coffee into the portafilter. Remove the funnel and evenly tamp to where the coffee stops compressing.
4. The goal is to pull 40 grams of espresso out in 25 to 35 seconds. I usually cut the shot a little short and pull 35 grams in 27 seconds.

Here is what I do for better milk texturing for latte art

Do not use the Panarello ( if your machine came with one) , use the wand only.
Milk is great for texturing, but if you do not want milk ( as I do), and you are OK with soy, get Pacific Soy Barista Series (available from internet vendors.). No other soy milk works as well.
Refrigerate the milk beforehand, pour the milk up to the line in the breville pitcher.
Turn on the steam aim the wand in the hole on the tray, let it purge and begin to produce steam.
Turn off the steam , put the wand in the milk, turn on the steam, lean the wand against the side of the pitcher Tilt the pitcher slightly and pull the steam tip up to the surface to get a milk swirl. It may be loud but as the milk takes in air, it will quiet down.
Bubbles may appear during this process. Once the milk is swirling, move the steam tip away from the side of the pitcher over where the bubbles are while keeping the pitcher tilted and gliding the tip just below the surface of the milk to keep the milk swirling and taking in air. Glide over the bubbles and remove them. Your goal is for the milk to be thicker and aerated like wet paint.
Feel the outside of the pitcher during this process, once it becomes too hot to touch push the wand into the milk, turn off the steam ( to prevent bubbles when the steam turns off). Remove the wand from the milk. Turn on the steam to purge the wand and wipe off the wand with a wet paper or cloth towel. Your milk should have very few or no bubbles You can tap the pitcher on the counter swirl the milk to further remove any bubbles."
4204,4.0,2021-09-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE: As a last ditch-effort to not call this purchase a total loss, I contacted Breville Customer Service one last time to see if they would at least buy the machine back from me to use the parts in their refurbished machines. To my complete surprise, after giving him the serial number, the person I spoke to said the machine was ""not that old,"" and that he would arrange for me to send it back, have it repaired and returned to me at no cost. The process took 2 weeks, and my machine works better now (so far) than it did when I first purchased it. Very pleasantly surprised!

****************************************************************
I bought this at another retailer in Feb 2016. I LOVED this machine and the quality of espresso it delivered. I wanted to love it for a loooong time, but I couldn't. It no longer works. I took such good care of it. Kept it clean, used high quality coffee beans... But after 18 months of daily use (about 3-4 espressos a day), it won't produce. I called Breville customer service and they said I would need to send it back for repairs - cost would be around $250 - with no guarantee that the problem (whatever it may be) would be fixed. Maybe the water is too hard where I live... that could be the problem. But no one outside of Breville repairs these machines. No one... You can watch YouTube videos and try to repair it yourself, but you can't buy replacement parts. It's absolutely ridiculous to spend $600 on this thing, only to be told that you have to spend another $250 to see if it will to work again. Sorry, Breville. I will never buy your products again."
4205,1.0,2018-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Does not work properly. Called Amazon 3x to return. No response.
4206,5.0,2019-03-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I waited 4 months before reviewing the Breville BES870XL so I could learn to use the machine and get consistent cups of espresso and cappuccinos. First important tip #1 and foremost if I can recommend anything to anyone buying this machine and using it for the first time is to read the instructions and then read them again! There's a lot of good info and you can't blame the machine if you don't know how to use it.

We previous had a cheaper espresso machine and when it started to go we decided to upgrade to a better quality machine. Even after pulling our first shot on Barista Express, which happened to be a pretty bad pull, it was still better than our best shot on the old machine! So that says a lot about this machine. We spent our first few weeks getting our grind size, tamp pressure and shot amount just right so we could get consistent pulls each time. Now we have it dialed in for perfect shots every time.

One thing we learned compared to our old machine is that we filled our portafilter way too much. This machine comes with guide scraping tool that will level your amount of grinds after you've tamped. We found that we we're tossing quite a bit of excess grinds after our tamp so we adjusted the amount of the grind so that it come exactly where it needs to be each time after the tamp. Overfilling the grinds can lead to more tamp pressure when the portafilter is installed in the group head which will lead to an over-extracted shot! This will result in a bitter taste! A good rule of thumb to remember when tamping is that the top edge of the tamper should be flush with the top edge of the portafilter. To practice our tamp pressure we practiced pressing down to 40 lbs on a bathroom scale. Also we've only used the non-pressured filtered baskets.

When it comes to coffee we have learned much since our venture into becoming coffee connoisseurs. So my important tip #2 after reading the manual is to use fresh roasted coffee beans! When you use beans that have been sitting on a shelf, you have no idea when they were roasted and how long they've been sitting there! Old beans results in coffee that's weak in flavor and low to no crema on the pulled shot. We buy our fresh roasted beans from a couple of places. There's a Coffee Gear company in Seattle (hint search for it and it's not the green one) that will fresh roast your beans to order. We typically buy a 3-4 week supply at a time. We also have a local roaster in our area and get fresh beans from him as well. Be sure to get an espresso roast! It makes a huge difference.

My biggest challenge in using this machine is trying to create latte art. This requires more patience than anything and after 4 months I'm just now starting to get the hang of the simple leaf design! Latte art can be done with this machine but you're going to have to experiment with how much foam/microfoam to get vs the amount of milk, plus technique etc. Don't give up, it just takes a lot of practice to get the hang of it. I watched a lot of youtube videos it has payed off.

As far a maintenance, this machine is pretty easy. It will let you know when it needs to be back-pressured cleaned with cleaning tablets. The bean hopper and burrs can be removed for cleaning but we haven't had the need to do that yet. Important tip # 3 is keep your steam wand clean! After frothing milk be sure to let steam blow out the wand for a few seconds to keep milk from backing up in to the machine.

I don't really have any gripes about this machine but I here's a few things I've noticed that may or may not be an issue for some. Since it's a single boiler machine it will only pull a shot or froth milk but not both at the same time. Knowing this on our next machine we will be getting a double boiler. This will help when we have friends over and have a lot of coffees to make. It's not a big deal but a double boiler would speed up the process. We've found that we have to turn the grind amount almost all the way down to get the proper grind amount and keep it from overflowing. Again not a big deal but I think the adjustment knob is a bit off since we have to turn it down so low.

Otherwise we love this machine and we know we'll be happy with it for some number of years. Questions feel free to leave comments!"
4207,1.0,2018-10-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Conical burr doesn’t work !
4208,5.0,2021-09-01, Black Sesame,"LOVE this machine. I am giving it 5 stars, but know it is not without some flaws.

My espresso making history: got addicted to Starbucks, was shelling out $6.30/day on coffee and waiting in a ridiculous long line for 20 minutes each time. I finally broke down and said I need to figure out how they make this crack. I started out small and cheap with a basic cuisinart manual machine. Coffee came out ok, but lukewarm and after 6 mos(?) I had to replace it. After about a year, same thing. So that was funnn. Macy's had a great return policy. I upgraded to a better machine, maybe in the $200-$250 range? Again I found myself replacing it within a year. I think I went through 2 of those. But this bad boy--THIS thing is a tank. I think you could even hide under it in the event of a nuclear attack. I could tell I was dealing with a whole different animal the minute I tried to take it off the firm grip of the postal carrier's hands. (Apparently they had all been standing around it all morning drooling, and really didn't want to part with it) It was heavy. Like a kitchenaid mixer heavy. I knew I was dealing with a beast when I fired it up and heard the beefy pump priming. It rumbled my granite countertops--a sound I now associate with the greatest tasting cup of espresso ever. I bought it 3 years ago and it is still rumbling just the same as when I got it.

STEAM WAND: With my lower end espresso machines, the steamer never got the milk hot enough for my liking. Not this one. The steam wand is powerful. It is not quiet if you hit the milk just right. Like a train whistle! I had a hard time getting the milk to foam at first and then my sister, the former barista, showed me the error of my ways. You need to barely immerse the wand when you first start to foam your milk and tilt it while you get the top spinning. You can then steam the middle of the column if it's still not hot enough. Other machines instructed me to start the wand in the bottom center of the milk column. Sometimes I do that with the larger milk frother I have if I'm making 2 cups at once. Also: Make your steamed milk before your espresso so you don't over oxidize your coffee while you wait. (That's what causes that burnt taste)

Speaking of back-to-back espressos--this one does that whereas others I had I was finding myself talking sweet to the machine, flipping the on/off button in a series of Morse code like clicks, unplugging the machine, blowing on the cord, but really the trick was to wait 5-10 minutes between coffees while cursing loudly how I was going to be late for wherever I was going. Again. Sorry hun. No coffee for you today.

Complaints: loud. As stated above. A good way to get everyone up in the morning. But for good reasons (because it's sturdy and actually works). Narrow reservoir is a bit awkward to clean. I have small hands. I recommend you get small hands. Uses a lot of water. You need to clean the drainage reservoir probably every 4 or 5 lattes. The platform to espresso discharge height isn't very high so you can't fit a tall mug under it.
Tilted, yes. I can tilt my yeti tumbler just right so that it doesn't spill out while it brews, but still. C'mon engineers. You focused hard on the internal components and not so much on the user friendly ones. It can be a bit messy grinding your coffee--there's a lot of excess if you do it right. I save my excess grinds for my husband's coffee--he has less discerning tastes. Get a larger than 12 oz. Milk frother, too. It doesn't come with one. Also what's up with having to Youtube cleaning instructions? You will need to find your own instructional videos for operation and maintenance. They probably gave me a link or something and it's in the pile of warranty and product registration cards I accumulate and never actually look at or fill out.

BUT overall the best latte/machiato/espresso martini you can make. It comes out stronger than my other machines. So much more flavorful and not a dilute piece of crap coffee. House Guests say it's the best coffee they've had. Totally worth it and good enough for me until I win the lottery and can upgrade to the double boiler."
4209,3.0,2020-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I loved my Barista Espresso at first but after a few months it stopped producing sufficient pressure to make a good espresso. After following all the trouble shooting tips I contacted customer care-which was not easy. As nice as they were they were equally unwilling to admit there was something wrong with their machine and insist the problem is with my beans. I live in NYC and use the same beans all the time from 2 different very reputable coffee roasters-the beans do not change from one day to the next. Breville's solution is to use the Group head intended for pre ground coffee. Seems obvious that my machine should be able to make the same quality espresso, after just 6 months, it always has using the Group head that comes with the machine intended for fresh ground beans. I'm a very disappointed and dissatisfied customer."

I've had cheapo stream-driven ones at the very beginning and various single-shot systems later. I've been seriously thinking of going super-automatic for the convenience. Finally I decided to get this as a toy to play with on weekends. Boy what a toy it turns out to be. This machine has all the right components for a beginning amateur barista: built-in dosing burr grinder, razor, programmable volume and temperature, PID controller, thermal coil, pre-infusion... The feature list is just awesome given the relatively affordable price.

The number 1 thing that helps me was the pressure gauge. You can talk about crema consistency all you want, but having a ""quantitative"" reading to tell you your combination of tamp, volume, and grind is off or not is just fantastic, especially for those who like to measure things.

The two convenience features that are outstanding are the dosing grinder and magnetically attached tamper. Great attention to detail.

They also have both double wall and single wall filters. This is really a machine that you can play with as you get better at pulling shots.

Youtube has one review video that is particularly helpful to know all the features before you buy ([...] I just want to add two little tips for a beginner.

1. You might be perfect on your first shot, but if you're like me, you'll have to debug the process a lot. So get a cheapo bag of beans and DON'T drink your debugging batches.

2. I have a 1oz jigger. I find that to be useful. The machine's pre-programmed volume of single shot is probably not going to be spot on because the extraction amount depends so much on the beans, the grind, and the tamp. I find my shots are closer to 3/4oz using the jigger to measure. (You can reprogram volume).

I also have an infrared temperature gauge that I plan to use next on tuning the temperature, but that's just for fun. I don't think I'll be able to tell the difference.

So some of the CONS: (These are REALLY minor)
1. The cup warner is minimally useful. I haven't had the patience to wait until it warms up enough to make a difference. I pull a blank shot into my cup.
2. There is a nice feature of auto purging (if that's the right name). Anyway, after the steam cycle, water is applied to the system to cool it down to the right temperature for the espresso. I find that they did this too eagerly -- usually after turning off the steam, we'll set down the milk jug, grab the towel and wipe the wand, and then we'll turn it on again to purge any left over milk in the nozzle. This will make the machine heat up again and cool itself down again, sending a lot of water to the tray. The water also gets into the tool tray a bit. I noticed that the paper box in there got wet.

These are real minor nitpicks. Considering these are all I can nitpick (and I know how to nitpick), this is an unbelievably good product for its price range. If only all machines are like that! The one real downside might be you'll drink a lot more coffee that you intended. (I finally got a decent shot after going through a full 12oz bag of beans in two days and I'm really enjoying it.)"
4213,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Horrible. Broke after one year.
4214,4.0,2019-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I like coffee. I only drink decaf, and I generally drink it black. Over the years, I've had many different types of coffee makers - drip, French press, Aeropress, K-cup - you name it! I've always been too cheap to buy an espresso machine, and to be honest, I had never even bought an espresso, latte, or any other special coffee drink, because - you guessed it - I'm too cheap!

I finally took the plunge when I saw the Barista Express on sale as a refurbished unit. I bought this as a family gift for Christmas, not knowing how it would go over with my wife.

Now, to the review: The bottom line is, we love this machine! We buy good-quality beans from a local roaster, both decaf and regular. We have also tried prepackaged Starbucks beans. With all of these, we have been able to make good espresso shots. We enjoy mainly lattes and Americanos. A decaf Americano from this machine is far superior to any other black coffee I've ever made at home.

The learning curve for this machine wasn't nearly as steep as I expected. You pour in beans, the grinding is done automatically and the grounds fall into the filter cup (the ""portafilter""). You tamp down the grounds, then lock the portafilter into the brewing head. Push the button, and the espresso comes out! Different beans may require a different grind coarseness or a different amount of grounds, but these are both adjustable and it's easy to experiment. The pressure gauge shows you if you are in the right ""zone"" for good espresso. If it's too high, you need either fewer grounds or a coarser grind. Too low, vice-versa. It's pretty straightforward. Making an Americano from start to finish takes me about a minute, which is about the same as my K-cup machine. And of course there's no comparison with regards to taste! I've even done a cost analysis. Using locally-roasted beans and bottled water, I'm paying about $0.60 per cup, which is about the same or slightly higher than I pay for a K-cup.

Lattes are my new favorite drink! Learning to foam/steam milk was a snap. The machine takes about 10 seconds to get ready to produce steam, and then it takes about a minute to produce nice-quality steamed milk with as much or as little foam as you want. Pour this on your espresso for a sensory delight! I won't go into all the variations of drinks you can make, since they all seem to be similar - some combination of espresso, hot water, steamed milk, milk foam, syrup - whatever you want!

The machine comes with four filters. The double-walled ones are supposed to be for beginners, and there are two sizes of double- and single-walled filters provided. So far, I've only used the single-wall double-shot filter. I pulled a perfect shot on my first try, so I've never felt like a beginner!

I have a few minor gripes about the machine. First off, it makes a mess! The grounds don't all fall into the portafilter, so some of them end up on the drip tray or on the countertop. After every cup, I end up wiping grounds off the counter and the drip tray. I hate to waste coffee, but it's inevitable with this machine!

Second, it's not easy to switch between decaf (my preference) and regular (my wife's). You can easily remove the bean hopper, but some beans are still left in the grinder, and you need to sort of pick these out before you can put the bean hopper back on. Instead of leaving the hopper full, we just put in small amount (less than 1/4 cup) of beans every time we brew. I'm probably getting a little regular in with my decaf and my wife probably gets a little decaf with her regular, but it's not a big deal.

Third, the drip tray gets messy and needs to be emptied often. It's an overly-complicated 3-piece design, with a metal grate on top, a perforated plastic piece in the middle, and a lower plastic ""drawer"". I empty it and rinse it out in the sink frequently, and once in awhile, I take all three pieces apart and wash them by hand. Again, not too big a deal.

A few accessories I've found to be indispensable. I bought a dozen coffee-colored microfiber cloths, 12"" x 12"", that are perfect for cleaning up. I wet one of them every time for cleaning off the wand after steaming milk and wiping down the counter and drip tray. I also bought a ""knock box"". This is for dumping the ""puck"" of coffee out after brewing. You can dump it in the trash or your sink (if you have a disposer), but it's convenient to have this box next to the machine for quick emptying. Lastly, I bought some clear mugs (not the double-walled ones) that are just the right size for a latte and let you clearly see the perfect drink you just made.

I've only had the machine for a month, but we all love it! It is well-made with a combination of plastic and metal. The portafilter is very heavy-duty and feels like it costs $100 by itself. Overall, it looks very professional, and the results are precessional-tasting.

The durability of this machine will be proven in time! I know others have had issues, but hopefully my machine will be good one! I keep up with the recommended cleaning (it tells you when it needs a cleaning, and you use a little tablet for the cleaning cycle) and I've bought a bunch of the cheaper spare parts on the Breville website in case I need them some day. Don't buy these parts elsewhere, as the Breville website seems to have the best prices - when the parts are in stock, that is!

I would highly recommend this machine for someone just starting out with the espresso game!"
4215,5.0,2018-07-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As someone who is a new at home barista/coffee enthusiast, I am really happy this is my first machine. I wanted a reasonably priced machine that I could figure out how to operate with no prior experience, while at the same time, requiring enough manual operation for me to genuinely experience the joy of learning the art of espresso making. This machine exceeds that requirement. This is a step up from a Nespresso. In other words, if you are only looking for simple and cheap alternative to your daily $5 coffee, but don't want something that requires any practice, engagement, or manual operation, I would suggest looking at a fully automated machine like a Nespresso. But if you are particular about the flavor/quality of your latte, think you will enjoy learning how to make lattes, don't mind watching a few YouTube tutorials, and want a machine that can produce a REAL espresso shot, I would seriously recommend this.

If you are on the fence about wether or not this is a more complicated machine than you are looking for, it might interest you to know that there is a user friendly, or ""beginners"" way to operate this machine that takes away a lot of the learning curve. This would be referring to the provided pressurized baskets, which essentially allow you to make an espresso shot without having to knowledge and experience to use the proper grind setting, dosage, and tamping techniques necessary to use the also provided non-pressurized baskets, at the expense of not quite having the quality of flavor that you can achieve with the non-pressurized baskets. Most YouTube tutorials for this machine will explain in more detail what I am referring to.

There are some minor short comings for this machine. The steam wand is a little shorter that I would have liked (but still usable), and the relatively small boiler takes a little more than a few seconds to produce steam (prior to milk steaming, you should run some steam through the wand, turn off, quickly insert the wand into the mill, and quickly turn the steam back on to combat this). This is a tradeoff for having a compact machine.

Another trade off for having a compact and all inclusive machine is that the built-in grinder put your grinds at risk of ""clumping"", which can reduce the quality of your shot. This is because the machine must heat up prior to brewing, which can warm the grinds- a cause of clumping. There are thankfully some techniques you can learn about to fix this problem, but that might include a process of grooming the clumps in the grind, which some might find to be a little tedious. A buyer who is considering this machine as a cheaper alternative to more high end equipment might be disappointed by this.

Another complaint I have with this machine is that only the top layer of grinding burrs can be removed, which makes cleaning the unremovable part of the grinder a bit of a pain, usually requiring a vacuum. Also, do not ever remove the bean hoper unless it is completely empty. If you do not heed this warning, you will wish you had. Just trust me on that.

Finally, the automated dosage feature, for a double shot in particular, can sometimes be a tad messy, but isn't anything you can wipe up with a cloth, and there is a good chance you will want to manually dose your grinds the more you get into making espressos anyways.

Despite the above complaints, I still think this is a great machine; the quality of espresso as well as the overall value you get from this machine more than compensates for its flaws in my opinion. You really can make a latte that is better than anything I have ever been served at Starbucks if you really know what you are doing.

For the advanced barista and experienced barista, this machine might be a tad basic, and for the person who just wants a quick cup of coffee in the morning, this machine might require more effort than they would prefer to invest, but for anyone in between, I really think this is a great choice. As mentioned previously, you will need to invest some time into watching YouTube tutorials and or researching from another source. Be sure to include a knock box with your purchase, for you will most definetly need one.

CLEANING CYCLE UPDATE WARNING: Breville recently updated the cleaning cycle process for this machine. While the change is an improvement, most Youtube tutorials on the cleaning cycle were made before this change. 100% of the water during the cleaning cycle will now be drained into the drip tray, meaning you will need to empty your drip tray before activating the cleaning cycle. Water will no longer drip from the portafilter. This warning will hopefully spare you from some frustration and confusion."
4216,1.0,2022-03-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"You're done already? It was great while it lasted. But, these things don't last. Do a background check on this one. Or, prepare to have your heart broken."
4217,5.0,2018-03-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I read a lot of reviews on this machine and also watched U-Tube videos and read their comments before making my decision to buy this unit. A family member had a Breville in an older model with a separate Breville grinder which I used daily for a month so that's how I was introduced to making my own espresso, cappuccinos and lattes using Breville equipment.

I do recommend this machine or even an upgrade to the fully automatic one (I think it's called Oracle). I will say with this machine you might need to be patient with yourself and the machine while you work out what grind level is right for the coffee you've chosen and how much to tamp it down. I was starting to think I'd never get it right--the machine has a dial which shows if you are getting into the proper espresso range while doing the brewing. I couldn't get the dial to move and for a bit I thought it might be broken. But it's fine. It was a user issue. I was grinding the coffee too coarse.

Once I started using Canadian Kicking Horse Grizzly Claw whole coffee beans with the dual wall filter on grind level 3 with a moderate tamping only I finally had success. I do plan to continue experimenting with the other coffee beans I have bought as well.

I never had any trouble frothing the milk and now that I've greatly improved my brewing I may move on to latte art! There is a lot of info on latte art on U-Tube.

A few things to note, always clean the milk wand after each use and reset the steam after for a couple seconds to clean the inside of the wand. You can store the cleaning equipment in the small tray under the machine. Keep an eye on water levels as they do go down very quickly. I found it quickest to use a small never used teapot to pour clean water directly into the tank instead of pulling the machine out from the wall and lifting the tank off each time to fill it.

When I am successful with other coffee grinds I'll report the grind levels that are working and the brand of coffee. I did find U-Tube frustrating as demonstrators most often did not mention what coffee beans or grind level they were using.

The machine fits on my counter under the kitchen cupboards with still room to spare - I can remove the lid on the grinder and have room to pour beans in without having to move the machine.

This is a well made and sturdy machine and I do recommend it. Bear in mind it can take time you to figure out how to get the grind/tamp correct for the best espresso but don't let it deter you."
4218,5.0,2014-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought one of these and have had it about a year. It works great and I’ve bought a couple things to upgrade my espresso brewing, which is nice, but not necessary to enjoy the machine. My only complaint is the grinder does make a little bit of a mess and if I had it to do all over again, I would have gotten a machine without the built-in grinder. It works just fine, but with where I keep my machine, it’s somewhat an issue to refill and I also like to swap the beans, which is much easier with an external grinder. It’s not even a big enough deal to knock a star off, so take it as you will. One upgrade I do recommend though is a dosing cup. You can buy them on Amazon and other websites, but get one that works with the built in grinder button if you can. Will save you a ton of heartache when cleaning grinds and it makes it easier to tamp down the grinds."
4219,4.0,2017-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Each morning, I stumble down the stairs and turn this machine on and watch it warm up for about 30-40 seconds. Then I pull two double shots while frothing my milk In my Breville Milk Café. If I time it right, I have two cappuccinos in about 6 minutes, 8 minutes if I am unusually slow that day--ok 10 minutes if I am positively comatose!

I like the espresso it makes. I do not like how the grounds spill out of the basket, but I put a bowl under it and catch the spillage and put it back in the basket before I tamp it. That slows down the process of pulling a shot of espresso quite a bit, but wouldn't if you just decide to write off the loss of those coffee grounds each time.

The grinder tends to get the coffee beans stuck in it sometimes, then you hear a high pitched whine, no grounds come out, the motor overheats, and you get that whiff of an overheating electric motor. To avoid that, I poke the beans around the hopper each time to make sure there are no voids in the coffee bean supply.

The steamer seems to work quite well, but I don't use it because I already had a Breville Milk Café that I use for frothing the milk. That makes assembling a morning cappuccino much easier. On the other hand, somehow the steamed froth from this espresso machine seems different from the froth I get from the Breville Milk Café. Sometimes, I think it tastes better from my new Barista machine, but the old way is so much easier for me.

Overall, I would say it is a great improvement over my old Starbucks Barista machine which finally gave up the ghost after about 5 years of use. If my new Breville lasts that long, I will be quite pleased."
4220,4.0,2018-10-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have made a single shot of espresso daily for about 3 years with this and then one day the burr grinder stopped working. Tried taking it apart, cleaning with rice... nothing had worked. Breville suggests we send it in for $200 for repairs. No thank you. Going to purchase a different brand burr grinder to use with this until the rest of it breaks"
4221,1.0,2018-09-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,It was all dent and it dirint bring the duall cups
4222,1.0,2018-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Didn't work the way the video shows. Too expensive.
4223,4.0,2020-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my first semi-automatic and I have some bit of skill around grinding, choking, and calibrating espresso machines, thanks to some serious coffee geeks providing me with advice. So, I just bought this unit tonight, locally as I got an additional 10% off and I didn't have to wait for shipping, even with Prime! :-)

Initial thoughts. I've finished calibrating the grind and coffee amount. The espresso is really, really good. I was worried about the thermocoil over a brass boiler, but so far, I'm really impressed! One thing you absolutely must do, if you're not familiar with making espresso, you really need to read the instructions to get a great brew. Even as a semi-experienced home barrista, I resorted to reading a bit. Once I got the grind and volume correct, the extraction was truly great. I admit that the grinder could be higher quality, but as a combo unit, the value is there. I haven't used the double-wall portafilters, moving directly to the real ones. I'm getting great crema and feeling very satisfied.

I've never been a fan of a real automatics...it seems like something people don't really need, that smacks of being unwilling to learn and hand-craft. Having said that, I'm really digging the semi-automatic. It feels like the right balance. I still need to adjust the grind and tamping, but don't have to measure the brew length. The crema is there.

I haven't spent a great deal of time with the frother as I was focused on calibrating the grind and volume. I'll know more tomorrow, but so far, I'm also impressed with the frother as much as I've used it. Tomorrow I brew in earnest and make serious cappuccino!

The value for the money is great, given that you have to purchase a real grinder if you buy a serious espresso machine, and those can run upwards of $200 to start. The combo is delightful!"
4224,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Follow up almost 3 years in (March 2019): Breville is still kicking tail and taking names. Other than the consumables (filter, gasket seal on shower), it has performed flawlessly. Run the cleaning cycle when prompted, change the filter every 3 months, de-calcify 1-2 times a year and you're good to go.

When/if this one ever fails, I'll buy another.

------

We were in the Nespresso camp for a couple of years. Main reasons being 1) quick and easy, 2) tastes way better than Keurig.

Our Nespresso machine developed a leak and needed to be replaced. We wrote to Nespresso and shared that we were spending $1,800 a year on their capsules, and asked if they would replace our machine for free. They offered a 30% discount, but no freebie. Not a deal breaker, but enough to make us look around for alternatives. Working through the math, using a 12oz bag of Stumptown Hair Bender beans every week (@ $15 a bag), that leaves $1,000 per year for the cost of the machine. Assuming the machine lasts longer than 12 months, you easily come out ahead.

We liked the push button convenience of Nespresso and looked for a Super-Automatic espresso machine. We had gone through this exercise in the past and came away worried about reliability. No different this time. Shifting our focus to Full-Auto machines, we liked the look and features of the Breville. Ordered it up and crossed our fingers...by our estimation, even if the worst of the online reviews were true and the machine had to be replaced every 6 months, we'd still come out even/ahead financially.

We've been using the machine for ~16 months now without incident. The instructions were great for acquainting the newbie to grinding, tamping, pouring, steaming and frothing. Explanations of pressure, temperature and how to adjust grind size to optimize extraction were clearly explained. We were up to speed in no time. The time required to prepare a proper cappuccino is comparable to doing the same with a Nespresso machine, but there is no comparison with respect to taste. Freshly roasted beans, ground and tamped immediately before extraction. So much more flavor than a capsule.

The design of the machine is brilliant. Cleanup is simple, with daily cleaning requiring no more than a simple rinsing of the portafilter under the sink and a wipe of the frothing wand. The drip tray and ""Empty Me"" sign are cleverly designed. Very easy to disassemble, clean and replace (about 1 time per week). Preventative maintenance reminders are unobtrusive and easy to follow (it has an automatic cleaning cycle for removing coffee from the dispensing filter).

Overall, a great approach for anyone wary of the financial or technical aspects of a fancy semi-auto espresso machine."
4225,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Makes loud noise and only works half of the time. Very disappoiinted.
4226,4.0,2018-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I got this machine as a present and I've enjoyed using it everyday. I do recommend that you visit YouTube and watch the videos on how to use this machine. I bought a kitchen scale to measure out the exact amount of coffee beans to grind into the porter filter which is 18 grams for Intelligentsia black cat espresso (very good brand that will send you beans roasted prior to shipment) rather than fuss with the grind amount knob. After measuring with the scale they are the only beans that go into the hopper and I grind on the finest setting manually until it stops. Then tamp ensuring there is even grounds around the entire porta filter. I have been able to hit the top half of the espresso gauge with that method every time pulling some tasty shots. I also wait 20 minutes for the machine to warm up and run hot water into the cups to pre-heat them which helps make the product hotter. There are other great videos on you tube showing how to foam milk for some great latte art that I recommend. Overall this machine works very well when you get the hang of how to operate it. My only wish is that it didn't use so much water purging the steam after foaming milk as I'm having to empty the tray and fill the tank frequently. Otherwise do buy!
4227,4.0,2018-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had been shopping for an espresso machine for a couple of months. I'm not a big fan of drinking 2 oz of espresso alone because I find it too intense, but I do like Americanos. I was browsing at ""Sonoma-Williams"" & saw this machine after reading several online reviews. They were offering almost $200.00 off if I opened their credit card account, so I decided to go for it.
Since I never made espresso before, the first few tries didn't go well, but things got much better after some online education from various sites. There is a lot to learn about tamping, grinding & other techniques, as well as choosing the right coffee beans. One of the features of this machine that is not found on most other models is the built-in grinder. Most online reviews describe the grinder as ""Very Good"" for Espresso, which requires a fine grind that's not possible with cheaper grinders. After getting ""Sticker Shock"" at seeing prices of Espresso machines, I'd say this particular model is a pretty good deal.
One of the quirks about this machine is that every time you make espresso, it drains some water into the bottom tray. I suppose that is a necessary feature, though I have no idea what the purpose is. Just remember to empty it; you wouldn't want water sitting in the tray for too long."
4228,4.0,2019-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am on my second Barista Express with the same issue I had with the first one. In both cases the pressure gauge stopped moving into the espresso range after just a day or two of use. I noticed that in both cases the problem appeared after I tried making a shot when there was no water in the reservoir. There should be some sort of mechanism to notify you of empty reservoir and shouldn't let the machine operate. Will try a few suggestions posted by users here and talk to support as well and then update if there is a solution to this problem. The machine worked when it worked but two machines in just two days of use doesn't justify the price tag on it.

Update: Updating to 4 stars. I was able to get in touch with customer support who guided me to run a test for the pressure. Apparently the issue is not the pressure as the pressure does build up if you completely block the portafilter. As advised by the support rep I had to increase my coffee quantity by filling the filter all the way to the brim and then tamping it down. I was previously shaving off some extra coffee using the provided razor after tamping, but apparently the razor is meant for a particular type and grind of coffee. I am using pre-ground Lavazza Crema Gusto for now. It seems the whole system is very sensitive to the type of coffee, fineness of the grind, quantity of the grind, temperature and shot quantity. Every time you change any of these parameters, you will have to experiment with all other variables to reach the sweet spot. Its a learning curve which you may or may not find a lot of fun to climb over a cup of coffee. But man, what a cup of coffee it is!!!"
4229,5.0,2020-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this Breville Barista Express as a Christmas gift. And quite a gift it is! I have a Breville espresso machine bought in 2006 and it has worked fine. But this one is a big step up. Some notable new features, but as with anything I suppose there are a couple of design issues, but not hugely problematic.

- The machine is a beauty. Industrial art! Polished cast aluminum housing. Weighs a ton, but that is good. It is very solid and stays in place when working on making espresso drinks. I've looked at a lot of espresso machines, and this one is the most substantial, solid piece of equipment.

- Makes a great espresso! Due to a number of design improvements or added features, the espresso made by this machine is superb. Mainly due to the design aspects like the pressure pump, the improved heating block design, the fresh grind coffee from the burr grinder, and the sophisticated controls. Of all the espresso machines I've had, this one makes the BEST espresso, and does it easily.

- The new water tank design it excellent, with the handle for removing and carrying, and the ease of access at top of machine, rather than behind the espresso handle.

- New tray design is excellent. Very convenient. And I like the pop-up float with the refill sign. Avoid any run overs if one forgets to check the tray.

- Lots of other very clever design features added, but I don't want to make this a book. But all good... except:

- Two issues I've encountered. Both manageable, but BREVILLE YOU NEED TO TWEAK THE DESIGN ON THESE...

1) Burr grinder doesn't feed beans sometimes. I was actually about to ask my in-laws to return this gift machine since after 4-5 attempts at grinding beans, the grinder refused to work. Then I saw a review that said you have to continually tap the side of the machine or the bean hopper to make the beans feed into the grinder. It's true, that makes it work. I just beat on the cover like a drum when grinder is running, and no problem with getting perfect fresh ground coffee. But the bean feeding is a design flaw, which Breville should fix to perfect such an otherwise fine machine.

2) I don't seem to be able to produce micro bubble fine foam with the milk frother. That may just be a technique I have not mastered yet for this particular machine; not sure. But it should be an easy thing to do, as was the case on my prior Breville that had a different design for the froth steam head. It heats the milk just fine, and can make some foam, but not the fine foam that one wants for a cappuccino. Design issue or operator skill issue, not sure.

All items considered, I HIGHLY recommend this machine. Oh, one other issue with it; the amount of coffee I drink has just about doubled due to the taste of the espresso I can now make."
4230,5.0,2019-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great for a few lattes a day and for those who want to keep it fairly simple.

This machine is not going to be for everyone, but nothing is. I like to think that I have a good understanding of grind, tamp, pressure, extraction. I can do a decent job on high end ($2500+) home espresso machines with a high end home grinder and can get a good extraction on the professional / commercial machines. I just don't have the budget or the counter space for a very nice machine. If those two obstacles were not in the way, I'd have a $2500+ machine with a very good grinder.

For me, this is a reasonably priced machine that gets me into home espresso. The grinder is good for what it is. It's not a high precision grinder that you get exact dose weight every time, but it's close. The grind adjustment isn't as precise as the high end grinders, but it's good enough for my purposes.

Extraction is good, clean up is easy, dosing is fairly repeatable. It's repeatable enough and easy enough to use that my 13 year old with some decent attention to detail can make a good latte. Much better than Starbucks, not as good as a high end local coffee shop, but for daily use and the daily cost of beans/milk, well worth the investment.

If you like Starbucks, you may not like this. Here is why - Starbucks isn't really a latte. It's a high sugar, high milk, low espresso drink with oily oxidized beans. You're getting very little coffee flavor and probably just enjoy the oversteamed milk and chocolate. It's not a criticism - everyone has certain tastes - this is to set expectations.

I can produce a very good latte - satisfactory enough for daily consumption, and with decent fresh beans from Jullian (Indiana roaster), BlueBottle (CA), or Counter Culture get a very good extraction.

The water fill is a bit cumbersome for a unit that goes under cabinets, but it's not bad. Clean up is fairly easy. The extraction dose programming is easy and makes it repeatable daily.

I like it. I've considered upgrading to a separate grinder and the Breville dual boiler, but it'd be more than double what I paid for this and I'm very happy with what I have."

4232,1.0,2020-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is not a cheap machine. So, you would expect that the company selling you this would be able to provide you top-notch customer service. Wrong. Their idea of customer service is - YouTube! Yes, go watch some you tube videos and figure it out. Unacceptable.

My machine for last 6 months has been doing weird stuff. Bitter coffee. Watery coffee. No pressure at all. High pressure for long time. I clean and descale whenever it tells me to to that. So, I called customer service and here was their questions for me ( I am not kidding):
1. What kind of beans you use?
2. Where did you buy those beans?
3. What brand?
4. When did you buy those (date?)?

Really. Do we remember this stuff? So, it is all about coffee beans! Blame the beans!

Overall, very disappointed. I don't know what options do I have for this expensive machine but my suggestion is to stay away from them. They do not have any customer service at all. When I told the representative about the issue, she suggested me to watch their you tube channel!

I will never buy this brand again. Companies who don't stand behind their products are not worth my time and money, They should not exist at all."
4233,5.0,2018-05-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Now that we're a year into a pandemic, I'm kicking myself for not buying this sooner. I'm a latte person, and within a week of owning this machine I was matching my favorite coffee spot with the help of youtube videos. I had never used an espresso machine of any kind before. Don't be intimidated, make the leap!

Like others have said, you're going to need to invest in a few more things to make this machine work for you right out of the box. 1. quality, fresh beans. I buy them weekly from my former favorite latte source, now my bean source. 2. Accessories that make your life easier (all available on Amazon - cheap options listed): A stack of wash cloths to wipe down your steamer ($14); Knockbox for your espresso pucks ($15); Airtight storage for your beans if you don't already have a vessel ($26); a Tamper Mat ($15), seriously, this makes a noticeable difference in my case; and lastly: a 53mm Distributing tool ($25) - this last one is a MUST for people who want to make it as easy as possible to make a consistent espresso pull."

4235,4.0,2017-09-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Update: 2/6/2018
After multiple emails with Breville's customer service department, they agreed to a one-time, no charge repair. Breville, sent me a shipping label, box, and packing materials. I packed and shipped the machine per Breville's instructions, and seven days later I received my machine repaired and in full working order. Changing to a four star review, due to the customer service rep who made this happen.

For the first 15 months this machine worked great. I made 3-5 double espressos per day without problem. I also followed the manufacturer's recommended schedule for cleaning and de-calcifying the machine. However, after 15 months I noticed the machine started to leak water in the back. My first thought was that it was an issue with the water inlet seal for the water reservoir. I replaced the seal, but water continued to leak. I ended up taking the machine apart, and I found that a small plastic connector had ruptured. I was unable to find a replacement part online or order one from Breville. The only recourse Breville offered me was to send the machine back to Breville to be repaired for $350, more than half the cost of a new machine. I declined the offer and decided to put the money towards a new machine produced by a different manufacturer that offers a better warranty."

We bought it from Bed Bath and Beyond but lost the receipt (despite showing them the bank transaction) and Breville refuses to honor the warranty and wants us to spend $200 extra to send it in for repair.

Better yet, there are next to 0 available switches to replace it with so we are stuck in a hard place. Overall we love the Breville machines, our last unit lasted over 6 years and was solid, it's sad to see the grinder quality is not there and the support is terrible.

4239,5.0,2018-02-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I read all the reviews and I'll say that I haven't had any mechanical problems yet as I've owned it for a few weeks, so jury is out on longevity, but I'll share my experience.

Unboxed, went to a local coffee roaster and asked for a recommendation which they provided Single Origin, Single Estate Guatemalan organic coffee. Got home and poured the coffee in and left everything on the default setting. A little too much coffee on the first go around so I adjusted the volume. Regardless of the volume selected some will spill out...just the nature of the beast. First shot of espresso...perfect. No need to adjust anything. Guess I got lucky.
Key is to get the right grind, get the right amount of coffee, and tamp the right pressure. Sounds easy and as I said, I got lucky....with these coffee beans. Ran through the first pound pretty quickly and everything I made tasted as good as anywhere I've great espresso and espresso based drinks...including Italy.

This is where it gets more difficult. I bought some grocery store brand single origin beans....medium roast Guatemalan. Settings are no where near correct. Volume of coffee different, grind not right and brewing pressure either too low or too high based on adjustments. To be honest I couldn't get it right with these beans. So I clear them out.

I had bought some starbucks single origin and put those in and went back to the default settings and all was well. When I run out of this I will go back to the local roaster beans but it's kind of a drive to get there but will be worth it.

Moral of the story.....when you get it right, stick to the same beans."

4241,5.0,2019-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Before I owned this machine, I had one of those Ninja coffee makers that 'claimed' to offer an iced coffee option, but let's face it, without true espresso, all those drip coffee makers just can't make decent mixed coffee drinks because they're always going to be at least slightly watered down. Now that I've had this machine for over a year, I couldn't ever go back to any other type of brewing method. For my needs, this thing has been the center of my coffee world, with every type of coffee drink I could think of.

I was concerned about how long it would last, if the pump would give out, etc. Well, knock on wood as it's been over a year now and the machine has not had ONE single problem yet. You do have to take care of it, though. It has to be regularly cleaned when the clean light comes on, and ideally should be flushed with water/vinegar once in a while for descaling. I use filtered tap water which does help a bit with not producing as much scaling. You should also clean the grinder at least once in a while with those cleaning substances that you can grind through (once every 6 months maybe?). Doing all these things keeps this thing in tip-top shape and working properly. Just like anything with a lot of parts, you really do have to maintain it.

But it truly rewards you for proper care.. and then some. Think about how much money you save with the incredible lattes this thing produces. I probably spend no more than $1 to $1.50 in materials for a latte, and that's with expensive locally roasted beans and organic milk. It pays for itself pretty quickly. The fact is, your own espresso machine with freshly roasted, freshly ground beans is simply going to allow you to drink better coffee than 90% of everyone else is drinking on a daily basis, because Starbucks, Peet's etc. don't use freshly roasted beans. Absolutely worth it."
4242,5.0,2019-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm one of those annoying coffee snob types. I actively seek out the best roasts I can get, and refuse to buy something that wasn't roasted that week. Additionally, I work from home so this was a very important purchase for me. When looking at having a home espresso machine, I made sure I did my research. My criteria was ultimately pretty simple:

Price. I have expensive taste in gadgets and this needed to be a reasonable purchase.
Mechanical simplicity. I absolutely did not want a super automatic, I don't think those make quality coffee and they always break down.
Ease of use. My significant other also had to be able to easily use the machine.

After four months here's my thoughts on how the Barista Express meets my criteria. It's perfect.

I am consistently pulling quality shots. It's been four months with the machine now, easily three or four runs a day through the machine so we're walking at least 200 shots. Maybe 20 turned out bad but I attribute that to the beans and user error. I get consistent grind sized and pressure. Mechanically the machine just feels like quality.

I'm thrilled with the price and value of the machine. In place of daily buying coffee at shops the machine has easily paid for itself.

Most importantly my significant other also loves the machine. It satisfies here need for easily made coffee in the morning while getting ready for day. Prior to this machine our coffee making was an entirely manual process, with various pour overs, areopresses, and french press. We save so much more time now while still having quality coffee.

I'm a big fan.

ONE YEAR UPDATE
No problems to report, it's still an excellent machine."
4243,5.0,2017-10-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought a Delonghi Magnifica six years ago and I used it at least once a day. Not to thread jack my own thread but it has been a workhorse and has consistently delivered a latte which has been superior to a Starbucks drink in many ways. Fast forward to three years ago when I was introduced to a REAL latte. I felt cheated. I still used the Delonghi but I also sneaked in some real lattes on a weekly basis. Fast forward to a year ago when I discovered an awesome ""craft"" coffee shop near work. I have been drinking their lattes every day at lunch. My taste is now so spoiled that my home lattes will not do. Moreover, I really need to cut down on those lunch lattes.

So about two years ago I searched around for a machine which could produce a great latte. The closest I could find without venturing into expensive or ""esoteric"", pretentious Italian-ish brands was the Breville Dual Boiler. A PID temperature control was now a must-have feature. Unfortunately the price was a little steep at just over $1200. It also required a separate grinder and apparently it would have to be an expensive one. So I waited for a couple years and made the most of the Delonghi which was still producing a decent latte.

It wasn't until a few months ago that I came across the Barista Express, especially the new and improved 2nd generation model. I was excited to find that it not only included the PID feature, but it also included the same grinder which separately costs two to three bills. Meanwhile, the total cost was a mere fraction of the one I was initially looking to get. Now, granted, the Express doesn't have the heated group head or the dual boiler but I was OK with those ""niceties"". I Googled far and wide and watched every video ever produced about this model. I saw enough to justify taking the plunge.

Fast forward to today when I received the package with the espresso maker. Despite all the reviews out there complaining of under-extraction, I was able to get an almost over-extracted shot on the first try. I apparently was overzealous with the fineness of the grind. I had to dial it back to middle of the road coarseness and now I get what looks and tastes like perfect shots. They're the right color, the right amount, the right time, and the right flow. I'm no connoisseur of coffee but these shots definitely taste ""different"" and in a good way. For starters I'm using ""craft"" beans. They can't be too oily or stale. They ought to be dry and recently roasted. Some of the best grinders out there simply can't handle oily beans (the ground coffee turns into Nutella and it gums up the gears).

After three or four shots I think I've got the process down. Keep it all within moderation: the grind size, the dose, the tamping force, etc. Then, if you're off on the pressure or shot time, make medium adjustments. Expect to have to play with the settings anew if you switch beans. After I felt content with the coffee, I switched to texturizing the milk. I have seen Phil Knight do it so many times that I thought it would be a piece of cake. I messed it up the first time and ended up with no different a steamed milk than I used to get with the deplorable steam wand of the Delonghi. That had me scared. Still, I had seen Phil do it so I decided to go at it again. Boy, am I glad I did. This time I did a dry run where I hadn't turned the steam on but simulated the angles at which I would hold the milk pitcher relative to the machine and the wand. I turned on the steam and off I went. On just my second try I was able to get perfectly (for my novice standards) texturized milk. It looked glassy and foam-free, just like Phil's. I am stoked. I can't wait to do it all again in the morning.

All I know is that the machine works great if you follow the instructions. In fact, everything you need to know is on that quick setup pamphlet that comes with the espresso maker. Make sure to have rags ready. You'll need a slightly damp one for the steam wand. The milk that lingers on the tip will scorch really fast on you. My steam wand actually clogged after the first try, despite me purging. It's remediable but it will get your adrenaline pumping for sure. Just hang in there and keep trying. Definitely watch a lot of videos of people using it first. When you get to use it for real, many things will make a lot of sense. In fact, the more you watch those videos, the more user errors you will spot. Another warning: the machine is a lot messier than you see in the videos. When flushing the group head, it will splatter all over the tray. The steam wand can also get VERY hot with use. Have rags ready at all times. Don't use paper towels. I found out the hard way.

Good luck and I hope you enjoy your purchase as much as I do. This is as good a bang for the buck as you can probably get."
4244,5.0,2019-06-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE: Almost a year has gone by and I am still in love with this machine! I do sometimes wish I had a double boiler so I could make the shot and texture milk at the same time, but it still isn't worth the additional cost. Brilliant machine and it was initially more than I needed, but I have grown a ton and my skills are not being held back by some poorly designed machine I would need to modify after-market to keep on growing.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
I have never owned an espresso machine, but decided I wanted to get into this because I enjoy Starbucks and entertaining. After a TON of research, I started out looking at machines around $200. All of them had issues like a poor steam wand, loud, vibrating the cups around, being cheap, and breaking easily. I was considering a few of the cheaper machines and then replacing the steam wand with an after market kit so I could actually have freedom to make latte art or whatever I desired. After weighing modification of the machine (which voids warranty), and all of the other factors, I just decided to put a bit more money towards the machine. I also looked at the one without the grinder, and this is actually cheaper than a separate unit.

It heats up quickly (within a minute), and the thing is built like a tank. I have not found a single limitation in this machine. It has all of the features of a machine that is $1,000 or more, and works like a champ. I am now making great tasting beverages that have a professional look. I have pretty much mastered the steam wand and can make nice artwork as well as the proper texture for the beverage I desire.

UPDATE (nearly 3 months later)
Still loving this thing! Got a chance to play with one of the cheaper ($199) units I was considering at a Kohl's, and what a piece of plastic crap it is. I also have a friend that turns his on before he gets in the shower, as it takes a while to warm up. I can go from turning it on to having a tasty espresso and entirely cleaned up in under 3 minutes! Most of that time is properly tamping the grounds, but that is why we buy this and not a pod base machine, right? I am making 2 or so beverages a day and bought a knock-box for the grounds as well as a few additional cups. Found out that ""espresso"" roast is pretty much the way to go here. Remember, I started with zero knowledge and love what I have learned!"
4245,1.0,2015-02-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We are about to return our third machine.
1st machine: ground waaaay too much coffee. The filter basket was heaping full PLUS a big handful of grounds on the lowest grind amount setting. The bigger problem was the steam wand. It would shut off and squirt a stream of water into our milk. Called Breville at least 4 times. They made us send videos of the problem etc. Just one call was over an hour. FINALLY they sent us a new machine and we sent the 1st one back.

2nd machine: the entire espresso side of the machine worked beautifully (grind amount, pressure, yummy espresso produced) the stream wand was even worse than the first. This time we could not get it to stream at all. There is a thumping sound the pump makes when it is streaming that never worked properly on this machine. We opened it on a Friday and was advised by Breville to return to our retailer and by Monday we had machine #3. Our retailer tried machine #2 and confirmed that it was not functioning properly.

Machine #3: why would we get a 3rd machine? everyone talks about how great this machine is. The reviews are great. The people at the store talk about how wonderful it is and how much people like it. We thought maybe the third time would be a charm. It grinds fine (amount etc) It stopped producing a dry puck after a week. The stream wand will start but not restart. So, we have to turn the machine off and then on again to do more than one latte. This machine will go back today. Obviously we won't try a fourth. 🙈☕🙈☕🙈☕"
4246,5.0,2019-05-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My second Breville and the best! I upgraded from the smaller 800ESXL and the improvements and expansions are terrific. I read all the reviews prior to purchasing this unit and since I truly enjoy making my own beverages at home I invested in this machine. After a full month of heavy use and testing all the features I am 100% delighted.
however, having said that here are the pros and cons as I experience them:
Pros:
1. If you want to enjoy and play with settings/taste and quality at home this is your machine!
2. Maximizes the amount of coffee thereby using less coffee for better flavor
3. the new drip tray system is clean and easy and I enjoy the front reminder for emptying
4. The grinder is EXCELLENT! I have really appreciated that you have 15 settings of espresso grind. Personally enjoy setting 4.
5. The instruction manual is clearly written and does not take an entire afternoon to digest.
6. The quick instruction sheet is adequate until you have that Sunday morning or whenever to simply experiment and enjoy.
7. Americano's and tea for those who do not drink coffee is easy and lovely with the separate water filter
8. The steam wand is extremely effective, (best foam and milk I've ever made), and super easy to clean.
9. LOVE the easy to fill and carry water basket. The built in handle and design together with the filter are wonderful.
10. If you have a previous smaller Breville you will really appreciate the new drip tray design and functionality.

I am confident there are more pros however these are the ones that come to mind in the moment.

Cons:
1. Yes, this is a machine for those who want to really master great espresso and espresso drinks at home so it does take some learning. (about 30 mins initially and then it took me about 2 weeks of playing to master)
2. If you do not have a knock box, (which I suggest), the coffee grinding portion and using of the ""razor"" can be messy.
3. Learning how to go from the auto grind feature to manual takes timing and patience. I actually gave up on this and just use the manual which is so minor I do not see it as a detraction from my 5 star rating.
4. I wish that the water basket was larger. I previously had the 800esxl and it had a larger capacity for the water which I found convenient. However if you see my review of the water basket overall above since it is so easy to fill it is not too much of a hassle.
5. I find the custom programming confusing … and the auto sets and manual overrides are easy to use so for now that is what I am doing.

Overall this machine is worth the money and I truly appreciate Breville quality. It also looks sleek in the kitchen and I enjoy the one unit benefits that include the grinder."
4247,4.0,2015-10-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Overall we love this machine. It makes a great cup of espresso, cappuccino or other coffee drink. It's controls allow me to customize a drink to each person's desire. The unit is well built, except for the removable stainless steel drip tray. The tray scratches very easily, even though I only used a wet cloth and/or paper towel to clean off any spills. After 4 weeks the tray had dozens of deep scratches, so I contacted Breville to see if they would replace it. After multiple email requests, they finally sent me a replacement. I've had the replacement for 6 weeks and have only used a wet cloth (no paper towels) to clean up the spills. There are already 3 or 4 good scratches on it, even though I have made sure it was handled with extreme care. We also have a 4 year old stainless steel Breville toaster oven and it still looks like it is brand new, as does the rest of the espresso machine. It is apparent that the stainless steel Breville uses in the front tray is inferior quality, which is disappointing since the rest of the unit is well built."
4248,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Any review I've seen about quality issues usually has pictures showing the reason in their filthy kitchen- people who don't bother with any simple maintenance or cleaning.

I've now owned the BES870XL for just over 6 years. I didn't purchase on Amazon but I had to come here just to be clear, this thing is exactly what a casual espresso lover needs at home, with the flexibility to explore the craft. It's on the less automatic side when it comes to finding the right grind/water settings as you switch beans, but can get so much more flavor out of beans than something set up for press-and-go.
With the right level of self-control on the beans you buy, you can bring your daily corner-coffee spot budget down significantly... I'm talking sub-25 cent cost lattes at home that would rip you $7+ in a shop.

If you're willing to learn just literally the very basics of espresso making this machine has just the right amount of everything to make anything you could want with a small bit of practice and exploration.

In 6+ years of life, I've had to replace 1 group head gasket and nothing else. (the rubber seal around the shower espresso shower head) - a sub-$20 replacement piece directly from Breville shipped for free. Yep, that's it.
Give it the self-cleaning tablets when the light kicks on, and give it a de-scaling session a couple times a year depending on how hard your water is. (probably monthly for super hard water) - the thing WILL last and well exceed return on investment with regard to reducing visits to the corner coffee shop."
4249,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Twice broken
4250,5.0,2016-07-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this machine since July 2018. It has since been one year. First of all, this is not an automatic espresso maker. This machine is just like what you see in real cafes that make fresh espresso coffee. It's certainly not an industrial machine. It's intended for home use, so it will not work well in a professional setting. That being said, here are some things I have noticed regarding the machine.

- There is a learning curve. Read the directions, watch videos, and be prepared for an adjustment period to find the best settings for your own liking.
- Buy cleaning tablets. The clean/descale light will flash if you need to clean it. I use the Urnex Cafiza Espresso Machine Cleaning Tablets and they work quite well. The cleaning cycle can be done more than once. I usually clean it twice.
- Descale it when it tells you to. The light will be solid if you need to descale it. Don't forget to descale the hot water and steam dispensers.
- Clean the water/drip tray often. I noticed that if I wanted until I see the ""empty me"" sign, it ends up developing an odor. Do it before that happens.
- Clean out the milk frother after each use. This is done by wiping the outside of it and cleaning the inside by dispensing steam.

Overall, I love the machine. Many people gawk at the price I paid for it, but it is completely worth it and I've never gone out to buy another cup of coffee. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy the process of making the coffee every morning. I hope you get it and enjoy it. It's one of (probably THE) most used devices in my kitchen."
4251,5.0,2019-05-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes incredible foolproof espresso/cappuccino/latte! I used a Delonghi dedica for two years and it produced decent espresso with ground coffee, but never the espresso that I remember from a Illy cafe. I purchased the Breville and Here is why I love the machine.

1. Built in burr grinder. I can’t say enough on how important this is to quality espresso. I used ground coffee for two years and as soon as I switched to the breville with grinder, I noticed the crema was super dark, thick and rich. It squeezed the essential oils from the beans which gives it that extremely tasty chalky texture of quality espresso.

2. Pressure gauge... this is such a important tool to make quality espresso. It tells you if your tamping needs some adjustment or your grind is too coarse or too fine. If the needle ends up in the middle, you are almost assured a tasty espresso.

3. Comes with a tool to scrape extra espresso out of the portafilter so you have the perfect amount of espresso in the portafilter before extraction. Again another tool to make a foolproof espresso.

4. Quality steam wand with micro hole...this wand heats up the milk extremely quick and gives the milk a beautiful texture that tastes out of this world and makes latte art easy if you are into that.

I only wish I purchased this machine two years ago. The build quality is excellent even with some minimal plastic added. The machine looks expensive(not that it wasn’t) sitting on your countertop and is a show piece when friends come over. On the very first use, I made a espresso that matched the Illy cafe I used to frequent . It was that good! Bravo Breville! I’m truly impressed with what you have created."
4252,4.0,2019-01-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just got this beauty for Christmas and still learning the ropes on how to make the perfect at-home espresso. After going through cheaper, simpler espresso makers over the years, it made sense to upgrade to one with a built in grinder so we could buy great bulk beans instead of worrying about inconsistent grinds. That said, there's certainly a learning curve with this machine - for all the automatic functions it has, it takes an experienced touch to optimize the dose. It'll take some time to find the right grind texture and tamp pressure so starting with some cheaper training wheel beans is a good idea - I'd also recommend getting a milk thermometer, since there's no automatic steamer shut off or temperature gauge. Other than that, the quality of the machine is incredibly impressive and I'm looking forward to experimenting with the functions to nail down my morning latte.

Overall impression - a great machine for someone with a little more experience making espresso. The amount of steps it takes to get the perfect 'dose' is quite the addition to an early-morning routine (especially pre-caffeine), but even with some missteps in the grind and tamp steps the quality is already measurably better than the simpler machines."
4253,5.0,2017-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My family has owned this machine for just over six years now. It gets used 2-3 times daily and is just now starting to show signs of leakage and less frothing then it did when new. I have not doubts that with proper maintenance it could last longer. I'm sure its been neglected from time to time and the failures are likely our fault. This is an incredibly well built product and makes a great cup of coffee. Never an issue with the grinder motor or streamer pump. Yes, its expensive but if I were to add up all the $4-$5 coffee shop runs over the last 6 plus years that I didn't have to make well, I'm pretty darn sure we have saved a boat load of money. And it's super fun to use! If you can afford it don't hesitate. It will serve you for years and years."
4254,4.0,2019-06-20, Black Sesame,"Do not expect consistent results from this machine. Bear in mind this is not a professional machine. I’m on my second unit. I highly recommend purchasing a protection plan. With that being said, for the price you can’t beat it. You will get good espresso and can make caps and lattes in the comfort of your home (and save a ton of money). I had a machine shop cut the bottom out of my first portafilter and spent a lot of time trying to dial in and could not get the espresso to flow properly from basket. It kept spraying everywhere. This is probably why they don’t offer a bottomless portafilter. Preinfusion feature doesn’t really work which could contribute to this issue. Second time around I kept basket intact to avoid making a mess. Steam wand is a little slow, but works immensely better than cheaper home machines I have used. All in all I’d say for the price it’s still that best in its class. Just don’t expect precision and versatility. If that is extremely important to you, spend the extra $7500 and get a single group head Slayer."
4255,3.0,2019-05-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When the machine works, it's incredibly good; this machine makes coffee as good as a $2500 espresso maker. However, even with fastidious maintenance and cleaning, at the end of the day it's still an Australian-engineered interpretation of an Italian invention. That is to say, it is not reliable. The system that handles shutting off the pump automatically died after 3 years. Asurion took it in for service and, after 2 weeks of tinkering with it, declared it beyond repair. They're sending us a reimbursement check now for a new unit.

Espresso machines are notoriously fickle and unreliable, and this one is no exception. Get the extended warranty."
4256,5.0,2015-11-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Barista Express is a no-brainer investment if you enjoy coffee on a regular basis. Don't let the price tag fool you; this thing will pay for itself in less than two months if your household consumes 2 lattes per day (at a rate of $5 per purchased latte, assuming home ingredients are $2.50 for milk and $10 per lb for coffee).

Now for the functionality. This machine is best used by people who care about coffee -- not by those who want a quick ""fancy Starbucks drink"" and don't want to work a bit for it. This machine lends itself very well to fine tuning and adjusting for that perfect pull. You can adjust the actual conical burr grinder, the grind setting, the amount of grinds that goes into the portafilter, the length of pre-immersion time, the length of time it takes to pull a shot, etc. AND once you figure out your favorite settings, you can program them into the machine so you only have to push a couple of buttons.

Take note that the machine heats up quickly, but you will do best to let it heat up for about 20 minutes to ensure that every component is hot. Also, the steam wand DOES need to run before it is inserted into the milk in order to empty the condensation that builds up in the tubing. The machine does have a standby position that will make sure the steam is ready to go for 8 seconds.

I LOVE this machine! If you want something that is reasonably priced, definitely consider the Barista Express. The integrated hopper is indispensable. And don't forget to purchase a knock box!"
4257,3.0,2016-07-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine 3 days. So far I love it! I did not buy this at Amazon but at Best Buy where I did a store pickup. The day I picked it up Amazon by chance had thee machine down to $568 and Best Buy matched it.
I have already tried a variety of beans and it is VERY true that you will not reach the correct pressure unless the beans are fresh and good quality. I got poor results from 2 name brand beans that apparently werent as fresh as a bag of Starbucks expresso beans that I knew were fresh, The pressure was great and produced a great espresso. I also have some pre-ground decaf and Cuban expresso that I use with the double wall filters and get very good results, although not as good as with the fresh beans. I can't stress enough to get fresh beans, such as from a local gourmet coffee shop and look for the ""produced on"" date and not the expiration date. No amount of vacuum seal or packaging will do it.
It is a beautiful machine and complements my kitchen well. I have made a few very nice capuccinos where the milk comes out delightful,
There are some helpful youtube videos out there that helped a lot.
I know its only been a few days, but I am so happy with the taste and quality of the coffee this machine produces.
It is my new hobby and I look forward to my coffee every morning and decaf in the evenings.I live in Miami where there is some great coffee, especially of the Cuban variety and I look forward to experimenting with some local shops and roasters, I can only imagine how delicious really good fresh beans are..
UPDATE Sep 3 2015
Machine started to make a buzzing noise after decalcifying. It does not happen often and usually lasts a split second after I press either of the brew buttons. Called support and they had me clean the machine 3 times and run 2 decalycifies. Did not make a difference. The quality of the coffee is the same. I was offered the option of being sent a new machine with a credit card hold, where I could ship back the old one in the special packaging the new machine is sent in. This would allow me to keep using my present machine until I received the new one. Once I ship the old one back the credit hold is removed. I purchased a real decalcifying product by Umex as some have said that this fixes the problem where the vinegar and water mix don't so I will try that. If I choose not to place the credit hold I will have to pay extra for the packaging required to ship the old one back and wait for ups ground to ship the new one. The original box is not acceptable by itself to ship back. We do have very hard water in south Florida so that may be contributing to the slight buzzing noise when I first press the brew button. I also had purchased an extended warranty from Best buy for coverage for an extra year. Still love the machine and it makes some great espresso. Let's see how the umex works.
Update Sep 5
The Decalcifyer did not work, actually things got worse. Best buy had a new machine at one of their stores and I exchanged it for a new one. Back to Coffee Panacea! As this problem started to happen after a decalcification, I wonder if that is actually the cause. I used white distilled vinegar my first time,
By the time I went through several more decalcifications at Breville's request the proble actually got worse to the point the Barista Express became unusable.
I will adjust the rating after the results of this new machine in time.

Update 10/5/2015
Had 2 more returns. One where the descaling didnt work again, and one where the double shot single wall did not get high pressure.
Have had my current machine for 2 weeks. Still good.

12-30-2015 Still going strong. Used Umex full circle liquid twice since last exchange. Use frequent pauses turning the power off while descaling. Then ran at least 2 back flushes followed by the tablets and further back flushes. Faith is being restored in Breville.
Makes great espresso and milk froths.My skills are expanding and I am starting to play with art. My usual coffee is allcoffee Italian roast espresso whole beans. Great crema and taste. Will wait a bit longer before adding stars but definitely more hopefull"
4258,5.0,2018-05-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is THE best espresso machine I have ever used and I have used several commercial machines. This makes GREAT crema with the simple press of a button. Sometimes can make a bit too much foam but this is an amazing machine. I use Pilón coffee beans and it makes a great cup. It takes some adjustments to get the right setting on the bean grind but great once you get it. One thing I hate about the machine is that it uses a lot of water, you have to flush it after every brew in addition to the regular cleaning cycles (which it absolutely needs for proper use and care). Overall, zero regrets with this purchase. If you’re a coffee lover and hate throwing your money away at Starbucks because let’s be honest, they have the worst coffee on earth, just spend the money and this bad boy."
4259,5.0,2019-03-02, Black Sesame,"UPDATE: I used this machine for a week and it was still amazing. Then all of a sudden then for the life of me couldn’t get the expresso to pressure at 15 bars, within the gray zone on the gauge. I tried several grinds and amounts, different baskets. Is making a cup of coffee really this hard?

I took it back and later bought the Breville Duo 2 temp. No gauge and no grinder. The other reason I took it back it was too big on the counter, you really need to think about space and having a good 20” wide space to use and operate this thing. You need a damp towel, space for the coffee, supplies etc as you need to work fast and can’t be fumbling around things.

Apparently this machine was near $1000 awhile ago and now under $600! I got this at Bed Bath and Beyond for $479, after using a 20% off coupon that everyone gets. I was going to buy a Capresso Ultimate for $200, then why get that when I don’t even have a decent grinder. Any decent burr grinder will run $100, so by then i would already be into it $300. At this point what’s another couple hundred bucks to get a prime machine with built in grinder and 2L water storage. This machine is AMAZING!! I love the built in grinder that fills the filter with little mess... the steam frothier is excellent and makes it perfect every time. The expresso is amazing ! Everything is so precise and your not just buying a expresso machine, your buying a system to make stellar coffee!! It’s a coffee system!! After buying $49-$99 machines over the years I had to throw down to get this machine! To justify the cost I figure 1 latte a week or two will pay for half this machine in a year.
Heavy doesn’t slide on counter,
Stainless steal filter and parts
Good drain tray with storage
Better latte than Starbucks
Saves me money buying latte"
4260,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We go through phases with this machine. We will go 2 or 3 months and use it a few times a week and then we will get back on an espresso kick and use it 3-5 times a day for 6 months straight. We bought it back in April 2016... as of October 2020 it's cranking out great espresso just like it was when we bought it. We have always put filtered water in the tank and have never used the in-tank filters. In 4 years the 'clean me' light has gone off twice (I know because I just used the second cleaning tab that came with the machine). We have never used a descaling solution or vinegar. I chalk this up to always putting filtered water in the tank. The machine itself is very easy to clean and maintain. The drip tray slides out, breaks down into 3 pieces, and everything wipes clean. Coffee splatter wipes off the stainless exterior. There is a little compartment in the back that keeps the extra single/double inserts dry and out of the way. The bean storage is air tight so we keep a big bag of beans in the freezer and fill the hopper every other week or so -- never had an issue with stale beans. I was hesitant to spend $499 on this thing back in the day but it's been well worth it. If it keeps you from buying 100 starbucks lattes, it's paid for itself."
4261,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For the price range in my opinion this is the best machine you can get. However my particular machine has been a headache.... 6 weeks after I bought it the actuator for the grinder quit (the button to grind). I had to take the machine and circuit board all apart and replace it with a different one. Then it went strong for another year and got too much calcification or something. Ran vinegar water 50/50 mix about 30 times and it finally worked a little better. The steamer has always been very low pressure which I didnt realize until using a friend's machine whose steamer has 3x the steam coming out.

Finally a few days ago now the espresso brew has no pressure. If i grind the beans just right and prepare the portafilter just right I can get the very lowest pressure bar reached but not enough to create the crema in the espresso. So Im gonna buy a new one. 2 years is OK i guess but still kinda crappy"
4262,1.0,2013-09-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Product is great, but box was damaged and missing components"
4263,5.0,2018-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We got this machine as a gift from my parents this Christmas (they were feeling VERY generous) and have been using it for at least 2 cups every day for 2.5 months now. Like other reviewers have stated, this machine does take some experimentation to come up with the right combo of beans + tamping + coarseness + shot size to get the proper solution, but once I got all the settings adjusted, I get an absolutely delicious cup at the right pressure 95% of the time.

I understand some of the complaints that other reviewers have had, who seem very particular and knowledgeable about their espresso. I would say that on the whole, this machine doesn't return the same amount of crema that you see in online instruction videos and such. On the other hand, now that I know the right combo of settings and pressure to use, within 2 minutes of stumbling out of bed I have an Americano in my hand that is 10 times better than my best cup of coffee from a traditional machine. So yes, this machine probably can't compete with the $2,000 and up devices, but it is SO much better than being stuck with a coffee maker only, or one of those Nescafe machines.

I use regular Starbucks beans (we have found a lot of variation in the quality of the cup when we change to different beans, so just find the brand that works for you...don't get some fancy brand and stick with it even when it's giving you poor results).

I've found (against other reviewers' stern advice) that tamping the coffee twice makes it so you never have to fill it so high it starts to spill over, and I still get ideal pressure during extraction. You don't have to rely on the machine to measure the proper amount into the filter and worry about inconsistent results. Just hold the filter in on the spring-loaded button until you have what you want and release it. It will go as long as you hold it and stop when you release. If the grinder starts to spin up to a higher speed, just tap on the hopper a few times and more beans will shift down into the burr.

I also run a double shot through each basket twice so I can get mo' flava in each cup. I apologize if I just caused espresso lovers to shudder in revulsion.

Overall, we absolutely love the espresso we get from this machine and I think it is pretty awesome bang for your buck."

Review of: Breville - BES870XL Barista Express Espresso Machine
Reviewed by: The Examinator
Product rating: 5 out of 5
Packaging rating: 2 out of 5
Summary: Amazing espresso machine! Superb taste!

For details as to how this item received the given rating, see below:

This product does exactly what you expect it to do, make great tasting espresso. The quality of coffee you get at home jumps exponentially with this machine. As much love as there is for local coffee shops or big chains like Starbucks, with a bit of practice and taste tasting you can match the taste to what is familiar. Aside from cost savings from going out and making your favorite lattes at home, the machine is fairly easy to use with some practice.

It took some time to figure out the right grind setting, grind amount and quantity to produce perfect espressos and extracting the crema. The machine has two settings, for single or double shots. This applies to both grind size and shot size (the espresso that pours out). It has a nice sized hopper to give you a couple of double shots without having to load more beans.

Prep time, such as waiting for the machine to heat is minimal. Within a few seconds it's ready to go. Grinding takes little time and tamping gets easier with practice. Cleaning is probably the longest time as you want to avoid build up and having coffee grinds or smears anywhere. There is a clean/descale cycle that you have to do (there are two clean cycles). Each of them is rather painless and doesn't come often (depending on use).

One of the challenges is learning how to get to perfect espresso range. Even though you have the manual, numerous forums/posts and a few youtube videos, what worked for me was practice. I went through gallons of faulty shots (this was intended as a joke, it was more like a couple of tries). The issue was under extraction and the root cause is not tamping enough/not having enough grinds. After much reading and testing, I realized the fault was due to the following:

1) Not enough grinds (as in, not tamped all the way through)
2) Not enough tamping (or evenly tamping).
3) Using the razor tool

The simplest way I can explain this to anyone, is do not use the razor tool. Don't rely on the auto grind settings until you figure out what works best for your coffee beans. Grind to the recommendations provided on the coffee bean bag, such as a fine grind for dark roast (preferred flavors for us). If using auto-grind, ensure it doesn't over flow, that way you tamp down, then continue to grind and tamp until almost full to the rim. You can also press and hold to grind manually.

Another tip is to bounce the portafilter slightly while grinding, that way they shake and even themselves out a bit. When tamping, ensure to twist half circle if using the stock tamper. I highly recommend getting a cotton rag to prevent any messes or damaging your kitchen counter. The listed items prior and tips provided ensured I always hit the mark and extracted the crema while in espresso range.

The side of the machine has the grind dialer for grind adjustments. The other side has a knob that allows you to use the frother/steamer or to release hot water. The frother is loud, very loud and will sometimes continue to drip even after the function as been turned off, however, works great. The release is great when you want to rinse off your portafilter while making multiple lattes.

The packaging on this product was not the greatest. Almost every component/item/accessory was individually bagged. The entire machine came in Styrofoam which then had additional plastic. Hopefully they can go with more eco-friendly packaging in the future.

Pros:
• Easy to use.
• Easy to clean.
• Produces amazing tasting espresso.
• Electrical plug has a loop/ring which makes it easy to disconnect.
• Various auto-settings available.
• Fun experiences and lots of choices with creamers/syrups and other tasty drink options.

Cons:
• It's not all stainless steel as I originally thought it would me. Some parts are plastic, such as the grinder wheel, middle and bottom of water tray. Unfortunately this gives it a feel that it won't last as long.
• The bin that can go behind the water tray is kind of useless as the tools have gotten wet because it's next to the water tray.
• The razor was useless (see notes above).
• When grinding, the beans will get stuck and fail to go down into the grinder. This is easily fixed with a light tap though.

*Note, there are two ratings applied to the reviewed item. ""Product rating"" and ""Packaging rating"". The actual product will not be impacted by the packaging as these are two separate ratings.

In regards to packaging, the following are contributing factors against the ""Packaging rating"":

• In an effort to globally reduce and promote less usage of plastic, any usage of plastic or non-environmentally safe packaging/products/material will be marked negatively.
• Single use items that do not biodegrade or cannot be easily recycled (see point above on plastics).
• The packaging rating is being introduced to help drive a shift to more sustainable and environmentally friendly resources.

4265,5.0,2020-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The First attempts with std. settings delivered horrible results. After time the results were optimized and produced respectable results. The product is good. It's sold in Europe under the name Gastroback. This is semi-professional commercial devices. The US Website leaves much out, like the recipes in various sections. An all metal machine is long lasting, as long as maintenance is done. There is the other side of the coin that is stated on the farm ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it..."" over maintaining is worse then non at all. The real killer is calcium deposits.

I recommend using a separate Water descaling device before pouring the water into the machine.Your asking yourself, WHY?? Well in areas where hard water is available, pre removal of Calcium is very beneficial to the machine.The external Filter works slower and is more efficient. This allows the internal filter to last longer, the machine needs less maintenance.

Use good beans and don't flip-flop bean types. Expensive isn't a sign of quality beans. Visit the location try it yourself and in the beginning purchase only small amounts to try in YOUR maschine. The results from machine to machine can be extreme. The settings optimization for the machine can use up to 250g of beans before your ready to rock, and someone has to drink the espresso, leaving one big buzz behind. Coffee, null-problemo. Just crank up the water to match the cup size, but who would do such an atrocity on a good espresso maschine.

If you want really good Cappuccino, Latte and other milk cream types (Hot Chocolate :-) I'd recommend looking back at the Breville site and purchase the Milk Creamer. It's quick, efficient, and doesn't blast the milk all over the kitchen. This thing is the perfect match to the Espressomaschine. It has Induction heating to a specified temperature, while whipping the milk to a fine foam. Our grand kids are crazy about whipped milk.

Well that's all folks I need an Espresso..."
4266,5.0,2019-02-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this in 2015, and after 6 years, it is still working well. I have just ordered a silicone gasket to be replaced for precautions. I have not had any problems...
It required some learning curbs to get the coffee as I prefer since it is the manual machine to adjust coarseness and amount of coffee to grind."
4267,5.0,2014-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my first “real” coffee machine. It was easy to set-up, easy to operate and after about two weeks of tweaking daily shots, I got dialed in. The shots smelled fine, looked great, and tasted on point, as good as I expected and was overall, satisfied.
The only “con” was the brew water lower temperature. I produced an accurate & consistent 178 degree Fahrenheit reading at brew head (measured with an accurate ThermoPro temperature gauge, after 15 minute warm-up / pre-heated portafilter & +4 maximum degree machine program temperature adjustment). Coffee aficionados state 195 degree extractions are closer to ideal for optimum flavor profile extraction, so my Breville-purchased machine is “under” by about 18 degrees, but after balancing double-shot coffee weight content, tamp pressure, bean grind fineness and steamed milk frothing temperature, I think I come pretty close to better local barista coffee bar beverage- not exactly professional top quality results, but somewhere in between an aromatic Peets & Starbucks-produced cappuccino, closer to Peets. Then again, my dependable Breville isn’t $10000 either. I can accept a quality $600+ Breville machine versus a testy & beautifully designed high-end, made in Italy Jura.. Just wished the water temp at the brew-head was hotter. I wonder if any other owners of this Breville Barista experience the same thing?
In the end, this Breville Barista’s quality build, price point, consistent tasty crema-top shots, and easy to learn & operate is worth it."
4268,4.0,2018-10-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. My third and most expensive. Five hundred bucks is pretty heavy duty, but so is the machine. I bought this four or five years ago and it makes a great espresso - most of the pour being a beautiful tan crema. Minus one star: The grinder quit working after about a year - it was nice while it worked, but was a bit messy to clean and adjust - instead of repair (probably under warranty - but didn't want to give up the machine) I bought a ceramic burr hand grinder for 20 bucks and it truly is the answer. TIP FOR ANY MACHINE When you are done frothing, let the wand blow until you have completely cleaned it - milk tends to travel up the wand and will gum up your machine with stinking gunk that is expensive to have cleaned out. Being diligent about keeping it clean, this machine has not yet needed to be cleaned or serviced (but the grinder did quit years ago)."
4269,5.0,2017-09-18, Black Sesame,"We have had this Breville Espresso machine for almost 3.5 years. We LOVE it. We use it 3-4 times a day, sometimes more if we have guests over. It consistently provides great coffee. Without writing a super lengthy review, here are few points/tips:

1. Use good/fresh coffee beans, I prefer a lighter roast. Less acidic and more caffeine 😁. It also requires less cleaning of your grinder, less oils build up.

2. Read the instruction book that comes with the machine, all of it. Very helpful and important info on pulling good shots and cleaning maintenance required.

3. Descale with a full tank of half vinegar half water (don’t skimp on the vinegar) at least every 2 months, every month if you have hard water. This is what kills your machine. This is all in the instruction book.

4. The vibrating/buzzing noise people are talking about is - I think - because of scale and or coffee build up. My machine will give a short buzz when I push the single/double cup buttons every now and then. Usually when I leave the portafilter with coffee in it on the group head or its over due for a descale cleaning. One Breville rep. recommend a cycle of 3 descale cleanings and 3 backflush cleanings (with the tablet) letting the machine cool down in between. It did the trick. So I know as soon as I hear the slightest “buzzing” that it needs to be cleaned.

5. Run a quick cycle of water through the group head without the portafilter, after each shot pulled. Helps to keep it clean.

6. That’s it. 😊 turned out to be somewhat lengthy. We love the machine. And have no complaints. Breville has been very kind and helpful when we need their help!"
4270,5.0,2016-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is not a super automatic. You could get the idea that it is from the beans bin on top. It is really a burr grinder and a semi-automatic espresso machine in a single device. If you want a one-button espresso with decent crema and you aren't too picky, you will be happier with something like this  KRUPS EA8250001 Espresseria Automatic Espresso  We had one of those before and it works well.

The Breville is a handsome, beautifully designed and crafted machine. If you run it in bran-dead mode, with the restrictive coffee holders, it is very easy to use. If you want to learn a little more, and you are willing to take a little time, you can make better coffee.

The pressure gauge lets you know how you are doing with each shot. Over-extraced, under, or in between. Different points in the middle of the gauge will make shots that are acceptable but noticeably different. The factors that affect the pressure are:

- the amount of beans you grind (settable with a knob). More beans = more volume of grounds = higher pressure.
- the fineness of grind you select (settable with a knob). Finer = higher pressure.
- the vigorousness with which you tamp (nice tamper included, held up with a magnet, pull down to use it more ways). Harder tamping = higher pressure.
- the beans you use. No rule here, you just have to find the settings, and every bean or roast requires a different setting. Just expect to waste 3 or 4 shots when you switch beans getting it close to dialed. I keep a note card with the settings for a few different beans.

You can program the amount of water. As it comes from the factory, the shots are pretty short, even the double. I programmed ours to fill a small demitasse espresso cup with the double shot button. It makes a very tasty longish shot and uses half the beans that a double shot would use to get the same volume in stock trim.

We find the frothing attachment unnecessary, just an extra thing to clean, so we leave it in the drawer. Milk froths well. Youtube is a good source of instruction. I get close to the fine texture of my favorite New York City barristers without a lot of trouble. Very nice. I do like to use a milk thermometer.

Everyone is beautifully thought out and finished. The manual is clear and helpful. Very happy after a year. I would have bought it from Amazon but a local store had it and we can take it back there for service if it ever needs it and they will deal with shipping it."
4271,4.0,2018-12-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pros:
- solid build, heavy and firm in your hand (when you put your head in, the machine won’t lift. I tried the Delonghi Dedica - it was too light that I always have to push the machine down with my other arm)
- can make a great shot of espresso when you got everything right (I’ll share some tips on my experience with Starbucks Espresso Roast below)
- not as loud as other machine
- quick to heat up
- burr grinder
- usually would take 10-15secs before it starts brewing

Cons:
- steamer can take a little time (20-25sec or more before the steam comes out)
- steamer can be loud

Tips: I was using Starbucks Espresso Roast.
- grind level: inside setting 5, outside 9
- tamp: to the level you can check by the razor included with the machine
This would help get a shot in the perfect zone per the Breville instruction book (about 10AM clock mark)"
4272,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am coming out of Krups EA8250 family which does everything for you so this one seems like a downgrade at first instance. But, Krups machine or that level of automation has a disadvantage of very little room of customization.
Breville hits the right spot there, as it allows me to choose my custom grind. Not just that the Steam function is outstanding. Ready in seconds and does awesome froth. I also like a separate outlet for hot water as I like to drink tea as well.

The steam nozzle is very flexible which is a huge plus, beats Jura in this department. Between DeLonghi, Krups, Saeco and Jura....I picked this one because of customization of coffee at a very attractive price point

BTW...Bed Bath sells it at $100 cheaper with 20% coupons, I was amazed that Amazon was not wiling to price match.

No product is perfect for me and hence the 4 stars but not complains either."
4273,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine! It makes great tasting espresso and awesome frothed milk. We purchased this machine at a local store instead of Amazon. We did buy two coffee machines from Amazon but returned them. One was the cheap Mr. Coffee automatic espresso maker which made really bad coffee. The other was the Gaggia Anima Prestige. We thought the Gaggia was OK, but espresso and frothed milk from the Breville is much better at only 60% of the Gaggia's price. We bought the Breville for our vacation home to try a different machine. We liked it so much that we returned the Gaggia and bought a second Breville. The two Brevilles cost only $200 more than the single Gaggia.

We also enjoy making coffee because we have control over the taste and take pride in the results. It's a better experience than with the Super Automatic machines. Not only that, time it takes to make a latte with this machine is only about a minute or two longer than it would take with a super automatic. A cooking analogy would be: the Breville is to your Mom's beef Stroganoff recipe as the Gaggia is to Hamburger helper. Sure, the hamburger helper is quicker, but Mom's recipe is worth the effort.

We had one problem with this machine. We mistakenly bought flavored French Roast beans. I don't know if it was the flavoring or the type of roast, but we found that the grind shoot got clogged. We had to take the grinder apart and vaccuum out the beans several times. Now we buy Costco beans that are made by Starbucks. We buy the regular and decaf beans and mix them because we drink so much coffee and want to avoid the caffeine. Since then we haven't had any problems with the machine getting clogged."
4274,5.0,2015-05-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I kind of went into it blind, barely read the manual and picked up a few tips on the internet. The hardest part was figuring out how to beautifully froth milk but once I found the right instructions it was easy. Some things that really helped:

1. Warm up the coffee extractor under hot water.
2. Use a heated coffee cup (I did toaster oven at 350 for a few minutes)
3. To froth properly stick wand in just below surface (pitcher slightly above half full) near center. When cup is warm to touch, move wand so that it touches rim of the pitcher at the top. Run steam until cup starts to get unpleasantly hot to hold (around 150-165). Got perfect micro foam time after time, so far been using 1% and 2% and I think whole milk will do fine as well.

So glad I got this machine, next stage is to learn the art of latte freehand designs. It's easy to clean (remember to wipe wand immediately after warming milk, if you forget what I do is boil water and put it in there and then wipe), has a cool hidden storage compartment and the ridged top is perfect for a few coffee cups.

After thousands of double cappuccinos, it is still performing just like the day I purchased it (I follow all the maintenance guidelines). This machine is so easy to use, within less than two minutes I not only have my drink but all the components are cleaned before it is even served. Contrast that with other coffee machines that are ""simpler"", but require much more cleaning time."
4275,5.0,2019-02-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine for close to five years now and let me just say that when it comes to espresso machines, you get what you pay for. At this point it feels like an old friend - trustworthy, consistent, and always there when I need support. Other reviews can speak to its features and build quality, which is more than enough for the average coffee drinker.

I have made thousands of shots of espressos for cappuccinos, lattes, and affogatos. I've concocted all sorts of crazy coffee ideas with this machine. We buy fresh beans and roast them ourselves. I've found a local dairy farm that sells high fat milk enriched with cream so I can make rich, buttery cappuccinos for guests. Not once in all this time has my Breville failed me or needed a replacement part, which is more than I can say for most things I buy.

My advice is to wait for a sale. I used a price tracker and waited a few months until I snagged it at a $100 discount. I doubt that'll happen during the pandemic (coffee machine prices have skyrocketed), but I'd still consider buying this machine even at a higher price.

Read the manual when you get it. Take care of it, and it will serve you well for many years."
4276,5.0,2018-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Theres a bit of a learning curve, but it's well worth it. My wife and I use Kirkland's medium roast house blend for espresso - she adds some water and ice for an iced americano, and just add a little milk. Hands down the best coffee I've ever had, and the thing pays for itself with all the Starbucks we pass up on. It's a big win. If you're confused by the grind size and the espresso range, let me save you some time and get you to the perfect cup ASAP: the finer the grind (turn knob left), the more pressure there will be during extraction (needle goes higher), and the coarser the grind (turn knob right) the less pressure there will be (needle doesn't go as high). Now the trick is to get the pressure right at the center of that grey espresso range every time, I mean it's still great espresso if you get it anywhere in that grey espresso range but holy moly when it's centered....anyway when you first get the machine grind up some coffee and pack it down AS HARD AS YOU CAN. This is key because that's the ONLY way to ensure you are packing it down the same way every day. Now, let's say you have the grind size at 5, pack it as hard as you can, and the needle doesn't get high enough. What you do is you turn the knob one spot to the LEFT towards FINE so that you can build a little more pressure during extraction, don't forget to pack it down as hard as you! If it's still too low continue until you get it right at the perfect center of the espresso range. You'll waste a little coffee that first time, but you won't regret it because once you find that perfect grind for your maximum packing power, alls you gotta do is pack it the same way every morning and boom perfect espresso every single time. This is making my mouth water just typing about it. I think I'll have another cup."
4277,5.0,2019-11-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased one of these in June of 2015 and so have had it for over 5 years now. I'm very happy with it.

This is my first espresso machine. I only make one 2-shot latte in the morning and that's it. I descale it roughly every 2 weeks with distilled white vinegar/water, run the cleaning cycle when requested, and change the water filters every 2 months. I buy the same brand of beans and grind them using the built in grinder. I store the beans in an airtight plastic container beside the machine.

I agree it can be a bit tricky to get a good pull, though this generally appears to be a function of the quality of the beans and how long the bag has been opened.

I've found the tamping pressure required seems to increase as the beans age once the bag is opened and even sometimes from bag to bag.

I'm rarely spot on for middle of the pressure dial between under and over pulled but it's never a bad cup of coffee.

I haven't timed it, but at this point I'm guessing it probably takes no more than 5 minutes from grind to finished latte which is not too much time to spend to get a good cup of coffee."
4278,1.0,2021-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is a CA Prop 65 Warning in the manual. What it says is that the product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer or reproductive harm. I wrote Breville an email because I thought it might be something silly like flame retardants in the electronics or PCBs in the power cord which wouldn't worry me too much. But instead of reassuring me they sent me a list of the chemicals in the CA list of Prop 65 carcinogens which is a very long list of very complicated chemical names. I called them and they claimed they didn't know what chemical showed up in the testing of the Barista Express but that the machine was ""food grade"". I expressed some incredulity, because California gives the manufacturer the right to disclose what chemicals are present if they choose to do so. The woman at Breville told me I could return it to the store if I was uncomfortable. I don't know about you but I'm not that comfortable with ANY toxic chemicals in my espresso and I took her statement to be a coded version of ""you better take it back"" so I returned it Bed Bath and Beyond where we bought it. The machine looks cool so I'll give it one star. The toxic chemicals and Breville's refusal to disclose, are the reason I would give it no stars."
4279,5.0,2022-04-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is quite amazing. Every year I spend more than a month in Italy, and the BES870XL turns out cappuccino that is as good as the best I have had in Italy. In short, I love the machine!

However, to get the most out of the machine you MUST read and understand manual. Almost every variable can be set. I am an engineer and a pilot and read a lot of manuals - the 870XL manual is very well written so don't worry - it is an easy read.

Plan on at least an hour to get the unit tuned up to produce what you like. I found some factory default values to be pretty conservative - the default brew temperature was far below the typical espresso temperature. My guess is that the factory default is set low so the initial turn on would not scald a new owner (one who did not read the manual). But if you read the manual the temperature can easily be changed in either 2 or 4 degree pops - I used several 4 degree increases to get the temp up to 180 deg F (which appears to be the maximum settable temperature).

The 870XL is magnificent product BUT READ THE MANUAL!!!! If I could add anything to the existing manual it would be to remind one that if the machine seems to have died, there is a HIGH CHANCE that the water tank is empty.

I have owned four semi-pro espresso machines in my life and the 870XL is far and way the best of the lot. It is obvious to me that Breville did some good product research and superb engineering to generate a user friendly product at an affordable cost.

Sorry to be redundant, but chances are that you will never get out of the starting blocks unless you do read the manual. For example, the way they get beans out of the hopper and into the group is really neat - but not obvious - when you see how they do it you will smile and say to yourself - ""Now that's a good idea - I wish I had thought of that!""

The Breville 870XL has a lot to offer - don't miss out on any of its features and enjoy the machine.

Oh yes, once you get it tuned up, it is a piece of cake to run."
4280,5.0,2018-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After playing around with this for the past month I can truly say I am very happy with this machine. It took a few times before I discovered the perfect grind and dose amount, but once I got it the results were amazing. You do have to change it up a bit when you are using different coffee beans, but once you master the settings your in for a real treat. I have discovered it is best if you buy small amounts of coffee beans and use them within ten days for optimum taste and creme. This machine won the 2013 Award for best new consumer product by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. This semi automatic machine combines both brewing and grinding it one unit, and has some features you will only find on higher level professional machines. Those features are PID temperature control for extremely accurate brew water which is important for consistent shots (adjustable by 4 degrees each way up or down), a dry puck feature, and a purge system which releases excess steam in the drip tray so coffee is not burnt by residual steam in the boiler. This Barista Express has everything you need except the coffee beans and water to get you started. It has a beautiful stainless steel finish. My friend worked at starbucks and a few other high end coffee shops so for this to impress him that says a lot. The best thing to me is being able to make those espressos, cappuccinos, Lattes, Macchiatos, Americanos, Ristrettos, hot chocolates, or teas in your own home without having to go out and pay an arm and a leg for a good one. With some experimentation with some syrups, coffee beans and or other flavorings you are sure to find the perfect coffee drink for yourself.

This Breville model comes with the following accessories included:

Patented Razor(tm) dose trimming tool
54mm stainless steel portafilter
Single wall filter baskets (1 & 2 cup)
Dual wall filter baskets (1 & 2 cup)
Coffee scoop
Integrated tamper
Stainless steel milk jug
Cleaning disc and tablets
Cleaning brush, tool and Allen key
Water filter holder and a carbon resin water filter"
4281,5.0,2014-03-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was not a coffee or espresso drinker before I bought this machine. I would drink one here and there like 1 time per week. My friend is a big espresso drinker and has this machine that is 10 years old and she likes it. I was looking for a machine to buy for when she comes over and for guests. I was set on the oracle touch or barista touch waited for months for either price to drop or a sale because I didnt want to spend so much since its for others and I really wont be using it. After about 3 months of watching prices that didnt change much this machine went on sale and I said I would rather spend $450 than 1-2K, so I bought it. I LOVE IT. I now drink espresso every day and have to say I actually like it more than I thought I would. This machine has actually changed my day. I look forward to having a coffee now in the morning. I watched a few videos on how to use it and it was pretty easy. I have had this machine for about 7 months. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
4282,5.0,2021-05-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First started with a DeLonghi fully automatic 15 years ago. Great machine which finally broke after 7 years. Prices went up to the point that I looked for a cheaper alternative.

Got a Barista 860 which lasted 6 years. I consider that great for these much cheaper units; I definitely got my money's worth. Replaced it once the pump couldn't make the espresso I wanted. Considered replacing the pump, but for the price, a new unit was more cost-effective.

Replaced with a Barista 870, which I'm still using today with no issues.

Love the ability to hone how my drinks are made, something the fully automatic couldn't customize.

I've never had to deal with Breville's customer support, as so many others have complained about, as I've found these units to be trouble free.

Another complaint is that the pump wears out quickly; some say in as little as a month, others say 6 months. I used the 860 for 6 years before the pump was wore out enough to warrant replacement. This unit is over 2 years old now and still runs perfect. I make coffee every day, usually just once per day.

While Amazon is a good price, there are places to get it cheaper, which is how I bought both of mine new, not refurbished.

All said, when this one wears out, I'll buy the new Barista model of the time."
4283,5.0,2017-10-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this machine. READ HOW TO USE THE MACHINE and follow the recommendations. Do not over fill the coffee in the tamper, you will end up like a lot of people where the machine just drops to a dribble. Keep it clean, flush it out, descale it regularly and I would recommend using filtered water. Keep plenty of water in it, don't let it run low, you can burn it out. Ours has been going strong for over two years now. We recommend this machine to all our friends, the ones who had trouble overfill the coffee, didn't follow directions, didn't flush it and used tap water. I hope ours keeps going strong. We make about 3 coffees every day, so it gets a lot of use."
4284,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have owned a number of expresso makers over the years. I started with the ones that that Starbucks sold in their stores. I finally upped my game and bought a Gaggia Classic. I loved the Classic, but after a while I began to want just a little bit more from my espresso maker. I decided to upgrade my grinder which would have cost hundreds of dollars. I was looking on line for a used Gaggia Classic to use as a spare because mine was getting so tempermental. When I asked the seller why he was selling he said he had upgraded to the Brevia. I had never heard of the brevia so I did some research and I decided to spend that money on the Brevia instead of upgrading the grinder and buying a spare Classic. The brevia does everything well. The grinder grinds exactly how I like it. The machine makes great espresso and the frother is fantastic compared to the Gaggia Classic. Best of all, with the hot water feature my wife can make Americanos. We used to have 3 coffee makers on the counter, now we just have one."
4285,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,stop working after 5 month
4286,5.0,2019-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purposely waited a year before reviewing this espresso maker in order to see how it held up as well as to gain the full experience of its coffee making. I had spent many hours researching a variety of machines. And I can honestly report that this Breville espresso maker meets all of my expectations for quality, reliability and performance. First, the espresso consistently comes out rich in flavor and with that lovely ""crema"" that marks a perfect cup. After tasting my first cup, I said, ""I didn't know such flavor could be extracted from a coffee bean."" Second, the machine has been flawless in function. It's clearly very well made. Third, I love the high quality top grinder, which produces the exact grind necessary for full flavor. There are also controls to adjust grind and cup size. The tamper is solid and fits conveniently into a magnetic hold. Nice touch.

A negative: I find the instructions for cleaning rather confusing. I had to watch several Youtube presentations to more or less figure it out. And it is quite involved. But that's my only gripe.

I heartily recommend the Breville. You don't need to spend many hundreds, or thousands, of dollars for a machine that produces an outstanding cup of espresso. With Breville, you'll get maximum bang for your buck."
4287,5.0,2017-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've used this machine for about 3 years now. We purchased direct from Breville. Per the coffee drinker in this house, this machine is ""worth it"". As the non-coffee drinker, I will say that it paid for itself within a year, even considering the ""fancy"" whole bean coffee that we get monthly for it from Amazon Subscribe & Safe. This machine has been a reliable workhorse. It took him a couple weeks to perfect technique in steaming milk, finding the perfect grind, and getting the hang of it. But once he learned, there's no going back to the other methods of coffee we tried first (the stove pot, the fancy presses, the little froth machines, drip coffee... none of it). If you're on the fence, particularly if you're the non-coffee person in the house, I would say this is worth the cost. Eventually it does pay for itself and it makes mornings more pleasant, which is worth it on its own. I have also enjoyed several steamed milk concoctions made with it on cold winter days and they're just as good as I could get at a coffee shop."
4288,5.0,2014-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There were a number of considerations that were important when choosing which Barista to buy. The first consideration was to be free of the pod idea which, although very convenient, made the user dependent on one make of coffee supplier. Part of this consideration was that we were interested in a machine that would deliver decaffeinated coffee that would get as close as possible to un-decaffeinated coffee as well as traditional ground coffee.

After some research we found that the choice of machines that would fulfil those requirements was very limited. We bought this machine and have now been using it for several months.

There are several important factors involved to get the most out of this machine. Whether you use pre-ground or fresh beans it matters that the pressure achieved by the machine falls within the recommended range on the dial. This can most easily be achieved by adjusting the fineness of the grind. Pre-ground coffee is regularly not ground as finely as this machine will grind fresh beans so extra grinding is important. A few seconds extra grind with a separate grinder such as a Moulinex, makes all the difference and the required pressure can easily be achieved. All it takes is patience and some practice. After that it becomes a simple and reliable routine. Much the same could be said of achieving the correct tamping weight to compress the ground beans before final processing.

The machine requires occasional and easy maintenance. Most frequent is the use of a cleaning tablet which backwashes the machine. This is a simple procedure and is done when the machine tells you and takes about 5 minutes of automation. Changing the water filter and descaling are the remaining two easy procedures and will be relative to the hardness or softness of the water supply.

In practice this machine has delivered excellent coffee as good as that found in good commercial outlets, and better than many. Home coffee is now the preferred choice.

This has proved to be a very reliable machine delivering excellent results. It also gives the user complete freedom to choose any make of coffee, either pre-ground or beans, caffeinated or decaffeinated according to preference."
4289,3.0,2019-05-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My BES870XL has just died. 4 and 3/4 years after purchasing. I will miss it, but the grieving period will be extremely short. This machine has given me much pleasure over the last 5 years, and I would strongly recommend it to someone looking for an introduction to espresso coffee at home. Consider this an influential girlfriend, right before you meet your wife.

Important detail 1: This machine will enable you to produce legit cafe quality espresso at home, with practice and persistence. You will need to master grind/dose/tamp/bean preference/milk texturizing (and milk choice - wow what a fricken rabbit hole that is) etc, but with practice and study, there are zero excuses for not being able to get an espresso/cafe latte etc that is on par with some of the best cafes out there. For real.

Important detail 2: the grinder is just ok. The grinder died about 2 years after purchase. Rather than repair, I purchased another grinder (Gaggia brand) and it was much better, so I stuck with it. I continued to use the machine with a bung grinder. It worked fine.

Important detail 3: You must clean it, frequently. Descaling and cleaning the heads definitely helps with the quality of the shots and operation of the machine.

Important detail 4: This machine is not optimized for big groups, you cannot pull a shot and steam milk at the same time. This slows down drink production. It's not an issue regularly if it's just me and the wife for breakfast, however if you have multiple friends over and you're trying to rip out a bunch of cafe latte's, expect it to be slower than it otherwise would.

Important detail 5: There are no bottomless portafilers available for this machine. They are sexy and I love them. Your SOL if you want one with this model.

Important detail 5: After nearly 5 years of faithful operation, I'm not buying another one. This has been a good machine to develop chops and has served well as a home espresso machine, but I'm upping the ante next time and jumping to the $1-2K range. La spaziale, Rocket, Gaggia or similar

Final thoughts: I'm not sure whether to be disappointed in 5 years but I am leaning towards a perspective of ""that seems about right"". Chinese made appliances, at this price band, in this day and age, should probably be expected to have a limited lifespan. It is what it is. While it worked, it worked well. However if you can afford it, I may lean towards recommending skipping this and jumping to a more premium machine from the get go. If you want to spend about 500-700 bucks, this is a decent buy."
4290,4.0,2021-09-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this machine after much deliberation. We did not have many choices available where we live, and the machine seemed overpriced at first. However, given the ridiculous amount of money we were spending at Starbucks everyday, we decided it was worth a shot. It took a week or so or constant experimentation to get the right extraction and froth, but once we got the hang of it, we are very thankful that we bought this machine. After 4 months of use, I can confidently say that we have saved a ton of money (it has made up for the cost of machine) and we are very happy with the lattes, americanos, cappuccinos and espressos we make. The machine is easy to use and clean and more importantly quite consistent.
I wish we had bought it sooner.
(We have had the Delonghi BCO264B Cafe Nero Combo Coffee and Espresso Maker before and used it for two years. This machine is in a different league than the Delonghi.)"
4291,4.0,2018-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So far, so good. I just purchased this machine 3 days ago and have made about six lattes since then. It does take some time and thoroughly review of the instructions to learn. I chose good quality beans and with fresh milk, the lattes surpass Starbucks. It's quite the little luxury to have when working at home. I will add that it is a bit messy and I wish it had some sort of retractable tray to pull out in the front to catch the flyaway grinds and overspray from the steamer/frother. I researched the prices across the internet and purchased this item from Bed, Bath & Beyond with the 20% off coupon for much less than the Amazon price."
4292,4.0,2018-07-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine, while it worked! Had it for 28 months and suddenly died 2 days ago. For a $600 machine that is too short a life. If it is the pump that went, and being told that is about a $250/$300 repair, it's not worth it to repair. We made about 4 cups a day, so I wouldn't say this was a very heavily used machine. So disappointed. At least we had a Square Trade warranty on it (that's a plug for Square Trade, great people to deal with BTW), so we'll get what we paid for it back. Just ordered the Rancilio Silvia M Espresso machine; we'll see how that goes."
4293,1.0,2015-09-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Had to return it. Dead on arrival.
4294,4.0,2019-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After a 1lb of coffee beans and some frustration , figured out I needed to increase the amount of time/water passing through the grinds. That was the biggest adjustment I had to make out of the box, after that just some minor tweaks and voila....great espresso shots! Nice compact size, good looks, organized well, easy cleaning. Pretty impressed so far, now just hoping for a couple yrs of durability. I had been getting quad lattes at S'bucks but a double shot of my favorite Ravens brew coffees in this machine is sufficient to get me going, better taste and cheaper too! Good job Breville. Not really a coffee ""snob"", so some may disagree with this. But I think it's a great way to experience truly good coffee at home without having to drop $2K+++"
4295,5.0,2014-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I want to preface this by saying I’ve worked in coffee shops for years, and I already had some experience steaming milk and making lattes. That being said, it was a bit difficult to learn how to use-setting it up was definitely a challenge for me! Now that it’s done, though, I couldn’t be happier. I use this thing every day (and I mean EVERY DAY!), sometimes more than once, and I make lattes I used to have to pay 5-6 dollars to make. Now that I’m used to how to use it, I can’t rave about this product enough. If you’re paying 5+ dollars a day for a fancy latte, and if you’re able to pay this amount of money, I highly recommend it. My parents bought it for me for Christmas (about 4 months ago) and if it broke today, I’d be buying another one ASAP! I also have been able to teach my boyfriend how to use it, and he can make lattes now to. Definitely a steep learning curve, but totally worth it for the amazing coffee I now have every day!!!"
4296,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After a 2nd trip to Italy, I decided it was time to have really good cappuccino at home. After much research, I bought this machine 1 year ago. I decided to buy it at Bed Bath and Beyond just in case it broke and I had to return it. I couldn't see packing it up and shipping it to Amazon or the dealer. (BB+B give a 5 yr warranty. use a 20%off coupon).

I love this machine! Get really good espresso beans. Follow the directions: warm the cup by running the hot water thru, and while you are at it, put the milk frother cylinder in the cup to warm up the tip of it. Then the cylinder will slide easily over the milk frother unit without tearing the seal. (I have already torn a chunk out of the rubber at the top of the milk frother.) Make sure you warm up the unit for at least 20 minutes. Yes, you have to experiment with the dual wall/single wall inserts, tamping pressure, grind fineness and grind amount. The thermometer gives you feedback, along with the attached instructions. Use them. The largest variable in getting great foam is to fill the metal cup less than half full of milk: half or greater results in poor/minimal foam. It does take 1-2 minutes to foam the milk which is a lot longer than in a coffee store. That not a problem for me, as I am the only coffee-drinker in the house.

Re: messiness: I don't see that as a problem. This is the nature of any espresso machine, whether it is an all-in-one unit, or if the grinder and foamer are separate.

Lastly, I am environmentally opposed to machines that use the plastic capsules. What, you are going to recycle 365 of them a year? Not good.

I look forward to my cappuccino every morning. It puts a smile on my face. I highly recommend this machine.

Pros: all-in-one, thermometer, works well

Cons: difficult to change the beans if you want a de-caf; have to slide the metal cylinder over the frothing tube every time which can damage the rubber seal. Because of this, I give 4.5 stars instead of 5."
4297,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had this machine for over a year, heavy use: >15 shots/day. excellent flavor, no issues. ordered a second one for lake cottage. tips: check water every day, running dry is not good for the pump. beans needs to be 1..3 weeks after roasting, if older extraction pressure will be low. dont tamp down too hard, push in the filter for a little extra beans if dose too low. dont let water stand in tank for more than 1..2 days. put in fresh water if u forgot. it's more steps than a fully automated Jura but flavor is better and drink is hotter."
4298,5.0,2019-01-12, Black Sesame,"We bought this machine in December 2011. At that point you could purchase the machine at Bed, Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon at $480 giving you an even better deal than Amazon.

Longevity:

Since our purchase in 2011 we've used the machine almost every day for the last 3 years. I'm happy to say that the machine including the built-in grinder works as it did on the first day. We were initially worried about the longevity about the built-in grinder, but it has lasted for 3 years now without any noticeable deterioration in grind quality. We did not have one issue in three years.

Coffee quality:

We have some true coffee snobs among our friends and even those have praised our coffee. If you buy excellent beans, this machine will produce espressos that are almost on par with what you get at a better coffee shop in San Francisco or Seattle. The quality is certainly far beyond Starbucks or Peets. We can taste a difference compared with our favorite espressos at Victrola or Vivace in Seattle, but the difference is surprisingly small for such an affordable machine.

Cost effectiveness:

It's reasonable to assume that you save $1 for every espresso you make at home and don't buy at a coffee shop. As we've used the machine easily more than 1000 times, we've saved more than twice the cost of purchase.

Cleaning:

The cleaning process is easy and hassle-free. The cleaning intervals are long enough that it doesn't become a nuisance. The required cleaning materials and filters are, however, not cheap if you buy the products recommended by Breville.

Shortcomings:

The steamer on the machine isn't perfect and it takes some practice with it to produce properly steamed milk. If you like Americanos, you will miss a hot water dispenser making it necessary to boil your own hot water using a separate machine. The settings such as ""grind amount"" and ""coarseness"" require some tuning before you get the ideal espresso out of the machine.

Given the price point of the machine, I don't deduct any stars for these minor shortcomings."
4299,1.0,2016-11-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Wasn't satisfied
4300,5.0,2016-09-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought one of these refurbished on a deal site for about half off. There were a few surface marks, but nothing major and it worked fine. I did have one problem with low pressure, and Breville Customer Service had me hold the button for a few seconds to return to factory defaults and problem solved. I have since learned the quality of the beans makes a HUGE difference. You want fresh roasted beans, and I think it is preferable to have them a little on the oily side instead of super dry.

This device makes OUTSTANDING lattes IMHO. I have almost stopped buying them at local outlets, because I seriously think mine taste better. We've had it for about 6 months, and if we were to have purchased each of the drinks we've made, it has already paid for itself. I haven't had to clean it yet, but did change the water filter once. Really love this machine and will be super bummed when it eventually fails. Will probably have to buy another one ASAP...

One recent tidbit: for a double-shot, try grinding a single shot's worth of beans first, then doing a light tamping on that, then follow up with another single shot worth of beans on top of that, and your final tamping. I seem to get more consistent pressure this way, and it also wastes a lot less coffee from overflow.

Update: my older unit only has a clean light; the newer models also indicate for descaling. I have learned the hard way that descaling is very important!! Also, they no longer recommend using vinegar. You should buy specifically formulated descaling products."
4301,4.0,2015-09-07, Black Sesame,"As with 99% of the home machines out there, it just doesn't get the water hot enough compared to industrial type boutique machines, not even close. This one problem has always been the nemesis of making excellent coffee or espresso at home. I love the machine otherwise. Makes a flavorful espresso nearly on par with my local coffee shop, but until the universal home water temperature issue is resolved, you cannot make at home what you crave."
4302,4.0,2016-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Cons:
-frothing milk is quite loud. Consider this if you will be taking the machine into the office.
-the grinder is only decent. Breville has provided a low end burr. Luckily you can ignore the grinder and use your own. The grind settings might lead you to believe they give substantial control but I find that with most beans I am always on one extreme end of the spectrum or the other. The grind amount setting is also useless. It pretty much hovers around less, but is inconsistent enough that every three or so shots you must grind twice to get the right amount of coffee. Other times it will grind too much.

Everything else about the machine is brilliant. Wish the PID had temp readings but that's okay, not really a con. Extraction time seems to be on the lower end, but consistently generates great shots if you are in the correct temp range according to the PID."
4303,4.0,2015-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We all may have experienced the day after Christmas woes; batteries not included and some assembly required. Well, imagine on Christmas morning opening a Breville espresso machine. As a novice barista, I was intimidated by such an impressive device. Eagerly, I unpacked and set up my shiny gift, but then my excitement was quickly replaced by frustration. First, don't expect to make a professional cup of espresso your first time. Out of the gate you should expect to stumble and fall. BUT don't fret, you'll be brewing like a pro. Second, you may need to employ some trail and error or search the web. You may watch every video and reading several blogs. So, I resorted to calling customer service. It was the most informative 20 minutes spent. Sandra was amazing and she got me back on track. Thank you!

Day two. We're enjoying professionally brewed espresso and completely satisfied with this machine."
4304,4.0,2019-02-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this machine for 3 months now. I didn't buy it from amazon as they were not the cheapest. Bed bath and beyond offers 10% off when you sign up for their weekly newsletter. I bought it from them and still saved $40 over the amazon price.

If you can afford this machine then it's worth it. Ease of use and great coffee. As with any espresso machine ground size and dose size make your shots vary.

To me fully automatic had too much room for faults and too many places to break. This machine is simple. I am very pleased.

But as good as it is for some reason nothin beats my Grandmas old stove top espresso maker.

Well done Breville."
4305,3.0,2013-09-19, Black Sesame,"We are total coffee snobs and are picky. I have owned 3 of these machines and just ordered a 4th. I will start by saying for the price point it is the best you can buy. Yes it is an expensive machine, but for espresso makers it is in the mid-range bracket. I researched a long time before going with this one and it is the best and that is why I have stuck with it. It has a lot of great features: the built in conical bean grinder is a great, the hot water dispenser is so useful, the different filters are essential, steam wand, etc make it a feature rich machine. Is it perfect? Not even close, but I have not found a machine out there that is, if you have please share! My research shows that even ones that cost over $1000 are prone to issues also and do not offer enough extra benefits to warrant the leap in price.

When this machine is working it makes great coffee drinks. The thing is it is prone to have issues and the reality is that these machines just do not last more than a few years. The good news is that in my experience Breville's customer support has been awesome! They replaced my last machine when it started having pressure that would go up and down continuously during a pull. They are also very helpful with troubleshooting. It functioned for 3 years and 7 months.

There is a learning curve with using and maintaining the machine but it is totally worth the time to figure it out (YouTube is a great resource for this). My husband loves the whole ritual of using it. You have to work out the right grind (different for every bag of beans), the correct amount of tamping, the technique for frothing, etc. The entire reason to own one of these machines is so that you have control over these variables, if you are not interested in that you should look into the automatic machines. The dual wall filter is great for when you are just learning as it helps you get a good pull if you are unsure about all the variables. The dual wall filter also helped when my machine started losing pressure. That has been the common problem with all of the machines I have owned. Eventually the machine struggles to come up to enough pressure even with perfect maintenance. There were some work arounds that did let me continue to use the machine longer with good results. I switched back to the double walled filter, I went to a fine grind, and tamped down with a good bit of force. My last machine the steam wand and hot water just stopped functioning out of the blue. I was unable to find a fix and took it into someone to have it repaired and he said the machine was done. So I just dropped another large chunk of change on a new one that is on the way. The reality is the machine makes my life better even if it is prone to problems and isn't designed to last more than 2-4 years. Having done the math it cost me $0.43 per day to own this machine. You can't buy a latte for that and we make a minimum of two per day plus a glass of tea so it is worth the investment. It does kill me that we are filling landfills with these broken devices since they are not built to last or be easily repaired but it is still WAY more environmentally friendly and cost effective than those horrid Keurig machines.

Here are some tips to get the most out of your machine while it lasts:
- Try to get locally roasted whole beans, fresh ground beans are crucial for good results. Coffee is volatile and oxidizes quickly so use fresh only.
- Clean as soon as you have any issues with getting a good pull, it will usually clear it up. You can purchase Cafiza tablets much less expensively than the Breville brand on Amazon and they will last a very long time (years).
- Run some white vinegar through the machine about once a month to help with keeping it clean. I do this in addition to using the tablets when the clean light comes on.
- Do NOT buy descaling solutions for espresso makers! The markup is outrageous. Descaling solution is simply citric acid and that can be purchased in a form that looks like sugar (just dissolve in water) for a fraction of the cost! It can often be found in bulk in places that sell baking and cheese making supplies. I paid just a few cents for a cup of the stuff.
- If you buy a bean that you do not like instead of throwing it out, grind it on the coarse setting in your Breville and cold brew the coffee. Even some of the worst coffees will come out tasting good if they are cold brewed (good for summer especially).
- Get a tamping box, you will make your life so much easier getting the puck out. Put the used grounds in your plants to fertilize or make your own body scrub from it (good for cellulite!).

Hopefully one day the technology will come along that these devices last longer but until then, this is a good choice. Happy brewing!"
4306,5.0,2019-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Okay shirt and sweet. If you're a coffee drinker and don't own an espresso machine, you're not really a coffee drinker.

I agree with an earlier review that it is difficult to not waste coffee on the minimal grind setting. Solution offered. We normally drink doubles, very very rarely singles. So, I just increase the time adjustment for the single shot grind button to get the exact amount of coffee into the portafilter. Easy enough.

We love this machine so much we bought one for each of our coffee drinking (over 21) kids for Christmas. Both seem to think it excellent since they loved ours so much. But as all things improve, they both got the newer model while ours is two years older. Biggest difference is they can now dispense hot water for their Americanos. While we have to use a tea pot on the cooktop.

Also, on our slight
Y older model, the dual wall filter was positioned as a quick and easy option. The grind size wheel was marked for dual wall settings. Their new ones don't mark the grind setting (very coarse) on their machine and position the dual wall for pre ground coffee only. I still use the dual wall. Makes perfect shots every time. I went through several pounds of beans searching for the traditional perfect shot using the single wall and honestly, none were better than the dual wall. Your mileage may vary.

When we were moving to our new house, we were going to get a fully automatic machine. Bit, after checking a bunch of the,out, we decided to stick with this Barista Express. There is still some satisfaction to tamping down ones shot.

On final note, if you wait a few seconds after obtaining your shot, you'll hear the machine sucking up the left over water from the puck. Let this happen. That way when you go to knock out your grinds, you won't sling coffee water all over your cabinet. And pick up one of the matching breville knock boxes. Took us a while to figure that one out.

All in all, if this one dies, I'll be ordering another ASAP. Perfect blend of everything you need in one compact package."
4307,5.0,2017-11-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had two very expensive automatic express machines. Both failed to 1) delivery excellant expresso and 2) were maintance nightmares. The Berville is what they call a semi-automatic expresso machine and it does allow for you to customize your shot, heat, grind and repeat the same on a consistent basis. However, if you think it is a step down from a automatic you would be wrong. Its a real expresso machine that is just a tool to make all the popular coffee drinks, but YOU need to know how to use the tool. Its like a table saw to a carpenter -- the carpenter makes woodwork, the table saw doesn't. I have had the Breville for a two years now and I am still learning on how to use the tool. While I am not at a carpenter level, I,not the machine make, excellant coffee. What I trying to say is if you love coffee made to your Taste, and want to lean how to do it this is your machine. However, if you just want a quick cup, this machine may not be the answer."
4308,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ok - So I didn't buy this off of Amazon but rather one of its other companies, WOOT.COM. I also purchased it refurbished instead of new. However, I did save almost $250 on it. I got the machine and it worked great. I do recommend watching some of the YouTube videos prior to use. The machine makes great Latte's and is very easy to use once you get used to it. Give it a couple days to get the settings right. Like I said watch the videos. About a month after I purchased it I was cleaning it and noticed a piece in the grinder, the Upper Burr, was cracked. The unit was still working but the grinder would clog every now and then. I got on Breville's Website and tried to register for the 6 month warranty that comes with the refurbished unit. Unfortunately I was not able to get to the registration page, may be my browser. I was able to get to the contacts page and I emailed Breville and gave them the serial number and told them what piece was broke. This was Christmas Eve that I sent the email. I had read a number of bad reviews criticising the customer service from Breville so I was expecting this was going to be a long drawn out process. However, within 2 business days I received an email from customer service saying they had received my email and had sent an order over for the replacement part. A couple hours later I received an email saying the order was received and being filled. The next day I received tracking information. Great support with no hassle. I highly recommend this unit."
4309,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this machine for over 5 years and it has been used non stop between our every morning lattes and constant friends and family over it is has been one of our best and greatest investments. Bought mine from Bed Bath and Beyond for more then listed here so at this price I would buy 2:). I have to say that I would buy this machine again without a doubt. It is worth 5 stars even with its little flaws. One flaw that is a little annoying is the the grinding amount is over adjusted and too much coffee gets grinded even when set to the minimum but you can stop the grinding when u want so that's why it's a minor flaw. This machine is all manual so if deciding on what your looking for, remember that if u like press a button expresso then this machine is not for u. Honestly this machine is worth more then $500 for me especially since it still works like new."
4310,1.0,2017-08-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,CRAP
4311,5.0,2019-02-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For everyone that adores lattes each morning and loves the art of brewing them to perfection, this is a great machine. I have owned my machine for five or six years and it has been a work horse. I enjoy the tinkering required to change settings when I change the types of beans that I use. I do not mind the periodic cleaning process required to maintain proper operation and results. This is not a machine for those wanting fast and simply prepared morning donut-shop tasting coffee. However, I assure you that the morning investment of time and effort will provide a meditative moment to contemplate the complexities of your day with a sip of a latte that beats any local or national brewed competitor - all of this while lounging in your slippers and sitting on the back deck of your house. Enjoy! I save enough money in not visiting Starbucks to buy a new machine every six months."
4312,5.0,2016-09-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this to replace my Delonghi after my keurig also died. I've had it for a little over a year and it's the best part of my morning routine by far. Every good day starts with an Americano with beans from the local roaster by my apartment.
The machine warms up quickly, within 5 minutes on its own, and if you're in more of a hurry, just pull a quick blank shot to heat the portafilter.
The grinder produces consistent and adequate results with beans less than a month old. I get a consistent crema with each shot once I dial in a new batch.
Cleanup is about a bimonthly occurance, with a filter change and potentially a descale required. Descaling has its own mode to quickly run the solution through the machine once the light comes on.
The steam wand works pretty well and the articulation allows me to shift the angle of the pitcher to get optimal frothing.
Overall this is probably the best addition I've made to my apartment."
4313,5.0,2018-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE: Now had 6 years! Not one problem after daily usage over this time. This is the single best consumer purchase of my life. It makes excellent espresso. I’ve saved thousands in Starbucks charges and my espresso is ten times better than theirs.

I've had this machine a week and it is excellent. Using just regular ol' Charbucks Blonde whole beans, it has produced a cappuccino as good as any snobby coffee shop I go to, and is LIGHT YEARS better than any drink I have ever had at any Starbucks, ever. After drinking crappy Starbucks cappuccinos for so long, I had forgotten that a good espresso actually smells like something, just as a fine beer or wine does.

The pros: As mentioned, makes as good a shot as a machine that costs ten times as much. It heats up in less than a minute. The steamer is functional and makes an excellent micro foam, although it requires some technique to do it. I also think the price is a plus. This is not a cheap machine, but certainly a great value for what it does, especially when you consider the built in grinder.

The cons: Don't buy this machine if you are helpless and expect to push a button and be done. Do yourself a favor and spend three or four times as much and buy a good fully auto machine. If you can get four things right, however, you are in for coffee heaven. You have to get the grind size and amount of coffee in the filter right (this takes a little trial and error but is not hard; I've found the double shot filter to be easier to use for some reason, for example). Then you have to be capable of using the right pressure and angle when you tamp down the grounds. Again, not hard but requires some practice. Finally, you have to learn how to froth milk. It's also not hard but requires a little bit of practice. Just google it and you can be pretty good in about five tries even if you are a total amateur.

Overall this is an excellent machine and I would recommend it for home use without reservation. It's also pretty darn good looking."
4314,5.0,2017-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Product is amazing. I’m a barista at my local third wave and while this isn’t a Slayer or Simonelli, it is a great machine for the house. I have fallen in love with it and love being able to practice and enjoy great spro at home. I was hesitant about the grinder from reviews, but it has turned out to be great, it just needed a few adjustments. It pulls great shots and it steams great microfoam. Tips: You may have to adjust the grinds from the inside depending on the coffee you use.
Steaming milk takes a while, you’re not doing anything wrong and it’s not broken, it just doesn’t have as much power as a professional shop machine.
The only downside of the machine is the tamp. The way it is shaped causes you to have to tamp with the weight of your fingertips. I would recommend getting an upgrade for like $20. Other than that, spend the extra money and get this great machine."
4315,5.0,2018-12-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine has been a steady workhorse for several years now. Produces wonderful espresso with an excellent steaming mechanism. Easy to tweak settings / tamping force to get a consistent pressure based on preference. . In short, a super-reliable, well designed machine that does exactly what it should."
4316,4.0,2019-02-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've owned mine for over 2 years. Cons: messy, needed service right after 1 year warranty ran out, stopped pumping, no pump, no coffee. Costs a couple hundred to service. Weighs a ton to ship. Has quit on me several times including my grinder once. Expensive to buy and own.
Pros: really good coffee.
Definitely buy the extended warranty for i don't see this lasting without repairs after one year. Mine didn't. I'm just holding my breath it'll last awhile longer. Good luck"
4317,1.0,2015-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this machine in June of 2020. It worked fine until January 2022. First, the grinder failed--totally stopped working. OK. So who needs a coffee grinder ON the machine, right? We bought a separate coffee grinder and began using it. THEN the pressure meter failed to work. Sum total: instead of espresso, we ended with weak coffee. Called Breville and discovered that, to fix the grinder, it's going to cost $270 plus shipping. So, now we're looking for a new espresso machine from a different manufacturer."
4318,5.0,2019-02-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"You won't need Starbucks after this, it's better says my mom. I bought it for her as a gift back in 2017 for $549. You'd think prices would fall over 4 years, what the heck! It went up to $699! Anyways she uses it daily, still works, no issues. She misses it when she comes to my house."
4319,5.0,2018-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am a professional competition level bartender with a decade of experience and even own my own roasting and coffee shop.

Heres how I see this machine. I have had it for nearly half a year, it has made hundreds of drinks and is pretty good at it. The design is well thought out, it is plug and play on any power source, the grinder is really good, good power from the steam wand too. The thermal block heats up water quickly and seems to give good temp. Its not a dual boiler, but why would you want that??? Spend 15 minutes and tons of energy heating up each morning.
This turns on and i push in the porta filter for auto grinding. Pop out the magnetic tamp that comes with this machine and by the time i'm done, the machine is ready to pull a shot. Takes 30 seconds.
Price is amazing, its half the cost of my espresso grinder for my professional machine.
Don't get illusions of running a business off this machine, but it is very impressive as a home machine. The hot water dispenser is priceless if you have a baby on formula or a tea drinker in the house.
Quality is awesome, i have little worries.

overall value is 10/10
overall performance for home machine 9/10
overall ease to clean and maintain 10/10
overall performance for a home espresso grinder 9/10
overall performance including pro machines 6.5/10 (top pro machines go over $50k)

my kit included everything you need except the coffee (which i roast anyway)"
4320,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was an excellent gift! Morning caffeine is a must for me, and because I commute quite a distance, having that morning drink makes the train ride that much better. At first I received the automatic cappuccino espresso maker, but I couldn't change my milk froth to how I wanted, so I exchanged it for this machine. I'm glad I did! At first I was intimidated because of all the gadgets and the reviews about practice practice practice....seriously, do not let that stop you. It's fun learning what works and what doesn't. This comes with a quick start guide(read that if you aren't planning to read the manual book), on the back it has an extraction guide that I have on my fridge as a reference point. This machine is perfect for self teaching: there's a burr grind that one could change from fine to coarse, then the amount, and how much one taps the grinds. All these elements have an impact on the espresso, do yes it does take practice, then when you find the combo that matches your taste... Oh it's a beautiful thing! 🤓Then you get to learn about milk frothing swirling the milk and foam. There are some helpful tutorials on you tube, out if the box, cleaning, and making drinks. I feel like such a barista now! Watch out! I had fun learning and still have much to learn, but overall am so super happy that I received this (albeit exchanged but still the thought was nice), hope you enjoy this as much as I do!"
4321,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This won't show as a verified purchase, as it was a gift from work. - It's something I wouldn't have bought myself - (rather would not have bought any Espresso device) - But I would definitely replace it with another if it died now.
I've been using it regularly since Mid 2016, - so 3 and a half years (I use it 6 to 8 times per weekend, my wife uses most days for 1 to 2 per day - lattes' - so she does use the steam wand, which takes a while to heat the milk, but ends up very frothy and silky)
It took a little time to set up and dial in, and we use Lazzazza espresso beans. I de-scale it every 6 months or so with water/white vinegar mix (we have very hard water) and it works like a champ.
It's good enough that 2 visitors have bought this machine after having coffee at our home.
Highly recommended."
4322,5.0,2017-12-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this espresso machine last December and have been extremely happy with it. I will admit that, at first, I thought some things weren't quite right. That was primarily due to my inexperience with good espresso machines. Sure, I had to experiment a bit with the espresso beans, the fineness and amount of beans to grind, and pressure for tamping them down. But, all that is worth it when you get the cup of espresso, cappuccino, macchiato, etc. that comes from this machine. The Burr grinder works very well, has all the adjustments you need to get the right grind, and is easy to load up with beans. The controls on the machine are quite clear (as is the manual that comes with it) so that you can make the espresso just right and the steam wand is easy to use to make steamed milk/foam.The ""clean me"" light is a great advantage to alert me when that needs to be done and it's quite easy to do. And, I love that the magnetized tamper is right where it should be all the time. I just wish I had the same thing for all my tools. Also, the stainless steel construction should not be overlooked. So many espresso machines are made cheaply with plastic parts now. This one is solid.

I must admit that I learned over the past eight months that this machine makes the espresso at the right temperature, not what I thought was the right temperature (which was way too hot!). It's so much better than the burnt coffee you get at so many coffee shops. I won't mention any stores by name here to protect the guilty.

About the only knocks I have is that the pucks are sometimes a bit wet when I make drinks one right after the other. They just need some time to dry out and cool off. But, that's pretty manageable using a coffee knock box. I also sometimes wish the water tank was a bit bigger and that the filters were a little easier to change out. But, all in all, those are pretty minor things to deal with to get the great espresso I do from this machine."
4323,4.0,2016-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love the machine the main concern is that looks like the machine do not produce enough heat, but I use the thermometer and was ok. The some day after at some point I think the grinder was damage. At that moment I gave one star. But after several trial and error , you tube videos explaining I mastered. I will give four because the operational instructions, specially troubleshooting section can improve a little."
4324,5.0,2018-06-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Not literally, but we were spending $20 there every day. Decided that I'd invest in this unit. It took about 20 tries to see how to get the espresso just right to be in the ""espresso range"" of pressure.

Five variables to get the perfect espresso shot:
1. Grind size
2. Grind time
3. Tamping pressure
4. Grind reaching the top of the filter/using the razer to get it just right
5. Water not being low

Some of these are trial and error, but after you find the magic settings, the machine is consistent.

Because we were going to startbucks routinely, I asked what exact beans they use for their espresso based drinks. It is called ""espresso roast."" So, we are buying those beans, but its much cheaper than buying the lattes, americanos, cappuccinos. After a month, I'll have to say that the coffee drinks we make at home are way more consistent than even startbucks.

I did see the one star reviews, and not sure what to make of it. Machine works great for us, and we're saving a fortune."
4325,5.0,2019-02-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was given this as a Christmas gift last year. I was beyond thrilled! It took me a couple days to find the perfect grind levels and fineness.
Overall it’s been really great! My wallet appreciates the lack of daily expense.
Things I did-
*I watched several YouTube videos on how to froth milk.
*I read the instruction booklet! The instruction booklet was invaluable!! Seriously, read it!!!
*I have very deep counters, so I put wheels on an old cutting board and placed the machine on top of that. This way I could move it to the back of the counter so it didn’t take up too much space.
*I made my own vanilla syrup for flavoring.
*I bought a knock box to keep all the grounds in one place. You can knock it into your trash, but beware that the metal is hot and can tear your trash bag. I compost all my grounds so a knock box works for me.
-I buy whole beans from a local coffee roaster. Do not buy cheap beans that look or feel dry. They will clog your grinder and it is a process to clean it all out."
4326,5.0,2020-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this 8 years ago and have used it multiple times daily since then. Keep the heads clean, descale and it will always produce a wonderful espresso drink. Americanos and Lattes are our favorites. This is not an automatic machine; There is a learning curve, but it makes restaurant quality drinks. There were some great youtube videos that explained tricks to using the frother efficiently and how to extract the perfect crema. Depending on the bean quality and oil content dialing in the pressure and grind combo might take a little adjusting. My only regret is not getting the double boiler since we use it so heavily in the mornings. It has paid for itself with all the money we have saved on making our own drinks, and frankly, they taste better than the famous corner coffee shop!"
4327,5.0,2018-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,I had sealed steam pressure cheap machines in the past. So once you would brew one double shot you'll have to wait for the machine to cool down before you could open it to add more coffee and water. This machine is just as easy as the ones you watched them use and Starbucks fill lock in place push one button and let it go. The grinder is the magic it is totally adjustable and you could get the grind that will suit your purpose and your taste. To me is part of the fun and science of experimenting with the different types of coffee beans. And seeing the effect that the grind and the time that you have the pump running can affect the flavor. But the magic is you will actually get the same flavor and quality that you get from the more expensive coffee chain stores like Starbucks. That's plenty of videos on YouTube to help the beginner to learn a trick of foaming milk don't let it intimidate you it's worth it and part of the fun.
4328,5.0,2018-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife purchased this for me for my birthday and I've fallen in love with coffee all over again. The ability of this machine to produce a reproducible and very delicious espresso shot is unheard of at this price range. If I were to change one thing, it would be to have two boilers, one for the espresso and one for the frother, however, they have that and it costs almost twice as much.

If you are willing to learn how to make an amazing espresso draw, this machine will give you the best draw you can ask for without destroying your bank account. There are better machines, but they cost what they are worth, this machine comes in well below what its actually worth. I can't recommend this machine enough!"
4329,5.0,2018-02-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've tried 4 different espresso machines and so far this is the best. It has so many options and calibrations that I love it. Its easy to use as long as you follow the instructions. The grind varies on the filter your using. I always make double shots, and they always come out just how I expect them. Just make sure you tamp it well. Don't grind to fine because it can become over pressurized, but at the same time don't do it too course because it can be under pressure. I have it set at 3 and it comes out perfect. I'm using Stone Street Coffee - Tanzanian Peaberry at the moment, so 3 is perfect."
4330,4.0,2019-04-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Right out of the box this machine did not work. After running through the startup check list (basically running large amounts of water through the machine) we went to make out first cup of espresso and the grinder spit out a few grounds and then stopped working. We called Breville and were told that this was a very common problem. In order to fix it we needed to take out all the beans, vacuum out the grinder to remove any stray grinds and then pour rice into the grinder and run the rice through, then vacuum the grinder again to get out any stray rice. That did fix the problem, but all and all the set up took over an hour.

Now that the grinder is working the machine makes a great cup off espresso. Very easy to use. The steam wand works great too."
4331,1.0,2014-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Not good at all
4332,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was a little worried about some of the reviews where people said it broke down after a year or two of use and they had to send it in for repairs.

After having used it for about two years, I have to say that I'm very happy with my purchase and the reliability of the machine (no problems at all). Considering the kind of heat and pressures it has to handle, it's pretty remarkable that it is as reliable as it is for the price – it really is a well-engineered machine.

We've been making on average two cappuccinos every day with it for those two years and I think one of the secrets of getting good performance is keeping the machine clean and well maintenanced. Follow the maintenance schedule and obey the ""Clean Me"" light on the front of it. Use a good descaler, change the tank filters and use the correct portafilter cleaning tablets regularly. Don't overpack the portafilter and keep the pressure in the correct range. Don't run the water tank dry.

I think treating it well is the key to getting a consistent and trouble-free experience out of it."
4333,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've owned every commercial and domestic espresso machine known to man (30 years of owning several busy Italian restaurants) and this is by far the best, sturdiest, most thoughtfully engineered machine, period. I purchased 5 years ago (11/2016). It tolerates heavy, daily use--Italian family with college kids who live at home--we make easily 12-15 coffees a day. Flawless. Easy, fast decalcifying with vinegar. Easy and automated group cleaning with tablet. Highly recommend!!! It's a shame more companies don't make solid appliances like this one, that last!"
4334,5.0,2017-12-29, Black Sesame,"Once you understand tamping, grind size to grind amount ratio, this machine will work for years. Change the filter after heavy use, I am changing it every few months and I use a third party filter product for this. Clean it appropriately as stated in the manual. I usually have to change the settings when i change to a different coffee bean. I also overrode & set the heating element to the hottest setting. I followed what seemed like endless youtube videos to perfect techniques. I use to practice tamping on a scale to lock in muscle memory and it ended up not really making a big enough difference. What i found out with this unit is that the porta filter ought to be a little snug when you clamp it in. If it is too tight to slide over, then this will create too much pressure and if it clamps in very easily then you didn't put enough grind in. I use it almost every morning going on 5 years now."
4335,2.0,2016-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worked great then it broke after 1 month. Breville Customer support gives a generic response that this is a ""normal problem"" and that the issue is ""old coffee"". Is it normal to have water leaking and low pressure with brand new coffee? Will be returning."
4336,5.0,2018-10-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My girlfriend received this as a gift [not from Buddy or Santa but from her siblings] and I am so glad she did. This machine allows you to make THE best cup of coffee, espresso, cappuccino you ever had [I get psyched out my mind! - sorry baristas] and perhaps even good enough to please Miles Finch [maybe]. I rarely buy coffee out now b/c I've become a bit of a snob. Totally worth every dime and as soon as it breaks I'll immediately but another. This ""luxury"" has become essential"
4337,4.0,2018-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This replaced my 20+ year old Krups. Have been using for 6 months, double shot in the AM, double shot in the PM.

4338,5.0,2018-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After having worked with a 15 year old Krups espresso maker that did a fine job, I got this beauty for Christmas. And it feels like I’ve gone from JV to Varsity. The quality of the machine is top notch - in both look and feel (right down to the heft of the portafilter) this is a premium appliance that produces premium results.

I’ve only had the machine for 3 days so far so I can’t rate its durability, but so far it is a solid piece of work. I only gave it 4 stars on materials because it is the economy model and so there is a fair amount of plastic - it’d be 4.5 if that was an option, as the stainless cladding on the more visible areas, and all the key elements, look and feel great.

For my budget I couldn’t justify four figures for a top-of-the-line machine - however with this I feel as if I have a $1,000 machine at half the price."
4339,5.0,2017-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have had several espresso machines since 1993. Breville The Barista Express Espresso Is by far the best I have owned. We use it every morning for Americana’s and Latte’s. My husband just said it’s worth it’s weight in gold. We LOVE it we have had it for 9 years and it keeps going as long as we clean it and take care of it. We have taken it with us on vacations and friends thought we were crazy until we made them lattes every morning. When friends and family come to visit they say staying with us is like going to a B and B. They love having espresso drinks when they wake up. I can go on and on I Love it!
4340,5.0,2018-02-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Let me put it this way, if I were homeless you see me pushing this and my Tempurpedic in my shopping cart down the street. It’s the only appliance I use every single day and I can’t say enough about it. Keep up with your cleaning maintenance and you’ll never be disappointed. And don’t get me started on how quickly it paid for itself. If you’re wasting time & money every day at Fourbucks, you need this machine.

Take the time to watch the plethora of YouTube videos on how to properly grind and steam, then practice daily. This recommendation comes with a WARNING: You will become a coffee snob and look down on espresso from anywhere but home. That is guaranteed."
4341,5.0,2019-01-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I don't usually write reviews on Amazon. But I am really happy with this machine and Breville's customer service. I bought it more than 4 years ago from Macy's and use it every single day to make at least 4 cups of espresso. The machine has never given me problem - it does its job, makes great espresso, look amazing on the counter top, day after day. It just became part of our life.

A few months ago I put the water tank into dishwasher (with heated dry) and the plastic was slightly bent due to the heat (my stupidity). My girlfriend contacted Breville and despite the age of the machine they were willing to replace us with a new one (they even shipped packing material to us). I think it's an overkill to ask for a new machine so we contacted Breville again and this time they sent us a new water tank.

A water tank is not worth a lot of money but it says a lot about Breville. I never expected to receive the level of customer service from a small appliance company and Breville just earned my loyalty."
4342,5.0,2018-05-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ill keep this short, I love this Machine.
I got it on sale but even at full price its worth it! If you are looking for a Quality machine to give you the espresso you'd find at your Favorite coffee shop then buy this machine. I bought the same beans that my favorite place uses and I was able to extract the exact same flavor. It only took a couple of weeks to learn and get it just right and thats mostly just time spent perfecting the milk steaming. I would recommend a high quality food thermometer for getting you steamed milk temp just right.

Its really just touch and go and your done.

Pros
Easy to use
Has a built in coffee grinder
sleek
well Built!

Cons
Smaller portafilter compared to Coffee house machines but not by any means a deal breaker."
4343,5.0,2019-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The is by far the best coffee machine I ever owned, and I had a few costing me up to $4000 Euro. All of the little stupid problem that other seaco's and co had , these machine deals with in the must elegant way.
I am a real coffee freak , taking my cup super seriously, and because of the very cheap price, I thought I was making a compromise on these machine, but I was so supersized with it , every day from another little thing I learn about it , everything is designed in a super brilliant way , and the whole family absolutely loves it . Last night me and my wife agreed that this machine is the best piece of electronics we ever got.
The engineering of the machine is superb, every tiny detail has been thought of , and you can tell that this machine has been perfected over many generations of previous machine, you don't get to this point of perfection so easily . the performance of both brewing and milk frothing is remarkable.
I saw some moderate reviews here and it's clear that hose guys just don't now how to use a manual machine.
It gives you so much more then expected for the tiny price.
I can't say anything about reliabilty , because I only had in for 4 month, god I hope it will never
fall apart... I L O V E IT !!!
Thank you Breville !!! Genius engineers!!!"
4344,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel," Okay, so let me start off by saying this did take us a bit to figure out. We initially thought we had a faulty machine because we could not get the pressure to rise while brewing. It gauge would not even move at all. Thinking it was a faulty machine, we returned it and ordered a replacement. Same issue. I kept thinking, it can’t possibly be our luck, especially since nobody else seems to have had this problem. We went through almost an entire bag of coffee beans. So after (lots) of trial and error, different beans, filter, and grind size, we finally brewed the perfect cup!

So don’t despair, it definitely was a bit of a learning curve. I never knew all the factors involved that affected this, but absolutely worth it in the end!"
4345,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"This 10 years old beauty still give me exceptional espresso every morning. Looking for an upgrade & read the reviews. My 2 cents:

Need to get rid of grind coffee caught between the double wall filter. The buildup usually cause pressure backfire & damage the machine.
I rinse my double wall filter EVERY time. Soak it in vinegar if coffee kind of ‘dripping’ from the filter.
I replaced the double wall only once, about $25."
4346,5.0,2018-04-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Okay, maybe this machine won't last forever. However, I have owned one for almost 10 years (same machine) and it has been by far the best investment in a kitchen appliance I've ever made. I use it every day and just like Kristin Davis in the movie Holiday in the Wild, if I have this machine with me, then life is good."

4348,5.0,2016-12-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had my 870xl for a little over 8yrs now, pulling 4 to 5 doubles everyday, I have a large family and we all love our lattes and cappuccinos, it's an amazing machine for the money and ease of use, I don't think it can be beat. The controls are simple and easy to use, steaming is easy, getting a a shot dialed in is fairly quick and simple, even when switching coffee beans from on brand to another (there's always variations in the beans). Only recently have I ever had any issues out of the machine, the auto shot shutoff stopped working, so I have to manually stop the shot now ... I decided it was time to upgrade, so I purchased a rocket Giotto bundle... I gave the breville to my son and it's still going strong, for the money they simply can't be beat... One of the best purchases I've ever made."
4349,5.0,2017-04-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just got Breville BES870XL, spent half day fiddling how to get satisfactory pressure to make decent crema, tasty coffees and expressos. Here are a few personal tips for good results for newcomers like me to get started:
Use single cup filter size with single wall filter basket. Adjust water volume to 7 to 8oz,.see owners manual pg 16, for manual adjustment of single and two cup volume button. For stronger expressos or coffees you can always press the water button to lessen amount of water.
Try to purchase high quality fresh coffee beans, combination of Arabicas and Robustos beans are good
Adjust grind size to 3 or 4, rotate grind amount to 1:00 position, adjust to 2;00 if you need a little more.
Tamp coffee with 30lbs pressure. You can practice feeling 30lbs of pressure with bathroom scale and use tamper until 30lbs show on scale.
Use single cup button, if you are making coffee or expresso, for two people, you need to make coffee twice. I could not get enough pressure using the two cup single wall filter that is why I am still using the one cup single wall filter and making coffee twice.
Adjust water temp 2 degrees higher, optional if you want a little hotter coffee, see page 19.
For easier rotation of portafilter onto group housing, rub a drop on vegetable oil on flat out edge of housing.
Using these tips, pressure rose to 11:00 to 1:00 position on gauge and 1/2"" crema and volume coffee to 3/4 level of 8.5 oz glass cup.
Hope you get good results too."
4350,5.0,2016-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the second espresso machine I've owned, and it is the best one so far! My husband and friends surprised me with it almost a year ago for my birthday, and it has been a joy to make and serve delicious espresso beverages. It is easy to care for, easy to clean, and I'm especially happy that the things like replacement filters and cleaning tablets are affordable. I have not been succeeding at foam art, but it makes better foam than my last espresso machine, so I think it has more to do with me needing to figure out how to do it with this machine and practicing than the ability of the machine's steaming capabilities lol. I love the storage it has, the built-in grinder and dispenser. My ONE sad face is that the height doesn't adjust for taller mugs and travel containers, but a lot of them I can still tip, or remove the tray to still brew the espresso directly into the cup. I just need to put a rag under the machine if I remove the tray."
4351,5.0,2017-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine has produced the Best cup of Coffee, that I have ever had.
Let me start by qualifying this with that I am a complete Foodie, I am currently a Sommelier (Wine Guy) I work in a high end restaurant, and when younger I worked in a Coffee shop. This at least tells you that I am not just an average schmoe that is saying this.
That being said, you don't need to have this type of palate, or experience to use, or enjoy this machine.
I know that the perfect cup comes from more than just the machine, the Beans are important I personally buy the Don Pablo Md-Drk Colombian Supreme Whole Bean. (I have also used regular pre-ground coarse Community Coffee with Chickory, to change things up).
So After you get this Machine, you will want to tinker and experiment A LOT. The reason for this being that each person's taste is different, and it will take some experimenting to ensure what you deem the perfect pull.

This is a very simple machine to use, if you don't already know how to operate an espresso machine, the instructions will literally walk you through it, I had my first cup in about 10 min, from getting the machine out of box and set up.

Breville has put a lot of thought in how to make the perfect espresso, and helping anyone using their machine and tools make the perfect pull.
First you will notice 4 Different Baskets (Filters) to fit inside the portafilter. A single wall, single shot basket, a single wall double shot basket; both useable for when you grind your own espresso. And a dual wall single shot basket, and a dual wall double shot basket; these are typically used for using pre-ground coffee, or espresso). Personally, so far I like sticking with the Dual Wall, Double shot, as I feel it creates a better pressure for all coffee, creating a better crema (head on the espresso), but again, I am even still experimenting, and this may change.

Two things I would like to highlight is the Tamper which is dual color, Black and Silver. The idea is that after you grind the coffee and tamp it, that the silver line should come right at the edge of basket. The second tool they give you is their ""Razor"" which is a precision trimming tool. After tamping, you insert this dual length metal trimmer. One length will Fit on the outside of the Filter, while the other will dip deeper into the cup. If you have too much ground coffee, in here the metal paddles inside the cup will allow you to trim the top of the espresso puck by twisting and dumping any extra; ensuring the perfect amount inside the filter. Official Breville tutorial video showing this process ---> [...]

After getting your Portafilter filled, you insert into body of machine and select what size shot you are pulling. Any button or knob you press usually has pre-factory set max that you can press and forget (except the steam). In this part, I found the factory setting to be a little short, Thankfully there is a program button (Please use instruction booklet for specifics), but even this I found to be Easy.
Press the program button, and then either the single shot button or double shot button. It will start to pull the espresso, then manually press whichever button you just pressed to stop the pull. That button is now programmed to pull that exact amount every time you press that button.
There are other programmable features such as temperature and so on, but I will let you explore and experiment with that yourself.

In Summary this machine will help you assist you on your way to feeling as though you too are a trained Barista, using a series of
tools for both education, and customization. You can experiment making tons of different coffees, and will find two things.
1) You will eventually find that perfect cup, and be able to recreate it on demand.
2) YOU WILL spend much LESS money on outside coffee shops (I have found that I will intentionally hold off, if I know I will be home shortly).

To give you an idea of what you may go through, Let me give a short example of my day. I will drink any type of coffee under the sun.
I typically start my Day with a Long Pull Americano (One press Double shot, then One Press on the Single shot without Changing Filter, Then turn Hot Water on to Fill the cup (Let it put Max Hot water, it will shut itself off after about 6oz.)
I explain this process because this has replaced both mine, and my wife's morning coffee pot, with pulling these.
We still own a Large coffee pot in case of Parties, visitors, any situation that requires a Full pot of Coffee.)
I will have an Double Espresso (or Cappuccino) in the early part of the Afternoon, depending on mood; and a Brevia (which is a Macchiatto with Half and Half instead of Milk) after as an after Dinner treat.

I would be remiss if I didn't at least try to find some Cons.
1) The price of this machine - Although it is very very very worth it, and after owning it you could justify it, by
a) quality of coffee you have, and b) you will spend much less on Coffee while you are out, by making that great cup at home.
but dropping $600 is a hard thing for most people to just come up with for a coffee maker.
2) Tall cups and travel cups won't fit. So you will have to pull your cup, and then transfer to another cup.
3) It does take some experimenting, to make that perfect cup, after you do, you will have all of the settings adjusted so it is very easy to repeat, but it does require some tweaking, and it will probably not be the in the first 10 cups you pull.
4) You may find yourself more addicted than before you owned the machine.

So there you go, that is my summation of owning this device. I absolutely love it, even the cons are not that bad, when you really look at it.
It IS an INVESTMENT, and you WILL get not only your money's worth, but I truly do believe it will eventually pay for itself in a year or two, depending on how much you spend on coffee at outside shops."
4352,5.0,2016-09-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Original review:
After 1 year and 5 months, my grinder stopped working. It’s not clogged, it’s an electrical issue. The button is not responding at all. No sound from the grinder at all. Everything else works, but now I have to fork up $200-250 for a new electric grinder. I’ve contacted Breville support and I’m waiting on a call back. Would update my review if they have a fix for me.

Updated: within a day of contacting their customer service, they responded and accepted to fix the problem for free. I live near the factory so I was able to easily drop off for service. I just picked up the machine and they fixed extra items on the machine for me to assure that it works like new. I couldn’t be happier with their customer service."
4353,1.0,2017-12-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolute Worst Customer Support I Have Ever Dealt With

Constant back and forth with this company regarding this espresso machine I bought in May of 2020. Sent my machine in during the 1 year warranty due to an intermittent malfunction. They replaced parts supposedly although they didn’t tell me what they replaced. Well, then I call a couple months later with the same issue and this time I do a video chat with Mario Lopez. The machine failed to pull a shot twice while he was on the call with me and he kept blaming my issues on the beans! Saying they weren’t fresh?? This dude would not stop with that excuse. Long long long story short, I finally gave up and decided to wait for my extended warranty to kick in.

And what do you know??? I send it in to Asurion and they ended up refunding my $$ due to their finding of a bad control board…

I will never buy a Breville product again."
4354,5.0,2017-12-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A few days ago I went about to prepare the morning lattes for me and my wife. We always do double shots. I put the cradle under the grinder and pushed in the grinder to start the auto grinding function. To my surprise it sopped short and I pulled the cradle out to have a look. It was only half full. I then noticed the Filter Size Button had accidentally been set to Single.
For whatever reason, I decided to tamp the half-filled cradle just like I would normally do if it was full. I then reinserted the cradle and ran the auto grind again. This filed the cradle perfectly and for the first time after tamping the grinds for the second time, I did not have a big overflow of grinds to clean up. In order to get the pressure up I found it necessary to grind extra coffee so that when it was tamped, the pressure meter would register properly.
With this double tamping, I now had virtually no over-spill of coffee and the pressure meter went almost to the top, something it hardly ever did in the past. It seemed to struggle to get half way. Now I had little or no clean up and the coffee came out perfectly.
Since this mistake, I have continued with the double tamp with the Filter Size set to Single and running the auto grinder twice with a tamp after the first grind. We have now enjoyed perfect lattes for several days to this mistake turned out to be a blessing. Give it a try."
4355,5.0,2018-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I'm at 1 year mark with my machine and haven't looked back.

I am an avid coffee drinker and was bored with my French Press. I waited a long time to buy this and read all of the reviews. I typically drink Americano's, espressos, and make lattes for guests or friends when they are over.

This machine is perfect for home use. It really makes my kitchen look great and the ease of use is incredible. I honestly believe if you drink coffee every morning and frequent a coffee shop 2-3 x per week this is your best investment. Between me and my SO I know we have saved money on going to coffee shops."
4356,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Each of the three machines we used worked wonderfully for about 18 months. Each machine lost pressure and failed around the year and a half mark. We were able to exchange for new machines but after the third failure we just junked the machine and bought a stainless steel percolator......$60.00.
4357,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"One day in and the blender has already seized and does not dispense coffee, even pre ground. Not to mention the machine does not come with the necessary tools to fix it.
Expect to put hours into this machine."
4358,5.0,2022-01-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"For the price this is an amazing machine. My husband and I researched for months and read many articles and reviews on several espresso machines and this Breville 870 was the top choice...they were right! There are many more expensive machines out there that probably are really nice and easy to use, but who can afford to pay twice to three times the amount for am at-home Barista? Not this gal. Anyhow, my friends have loved the machine so much that they have gone to by one for their own home Barista. I use mine literally everyday since the purchase. I LOVE IT!"
4359,5.0,2022-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been using this for a year. Coffee's just like any restaurant. It only took my about 3-4 tries to get the right grind, tamping pressure down to deliver a perfect coffee! I use it every day. Not sure if it was mentioned (probably was) but what I do is first fill my cup with some hot water (heat up the cup), steam my milk, run a cycle (single shot) of hot water through the machine, using the hot water to rinse the steam wand, then dump the hot water out of the cup, make the brew, add the steamed milk and enjoy."
4360,5.0,2018-12-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I looked long and hard for an affordable espresso machine that would produce an acceptable espresso, latte and cappuccino. I read all the reviews here on Amazon, watched many YouTube videos, and reviewed other sources of info on the web. It came down to the Breville or something that was well over $1,000 or more. I decided to give it a shot.

The learning curve was a little steep. It took a while to get the grind right, both how fine it is and the amount. The steamer takes a little patience. You do waste some coffee grounds with nearly every cup. I have now been using the Breville for a full six months, and I absolutely love it.

I wrote this review intending to upload a photo of the cappuccino my son made yesterday. The foam is a good 3/4 inch over the top of the coffee cup, and holding nicely. Amazon doesn't seem to give us a way to put up a photo, but I wish you could see this gorgeous creation from a mid-range machine. My son has worked as a barista, and he has no complaints about the Breville's performance.

I also want to mention all the brilliant design elements of this product. The tamper has its own spot, held with a magnet. The bottom comes out nicely for cleanup, and there is a perfect spot to keep all the accessories that you don't use. You can remove the water tank to fill it and clean it. There are reminder items that let you know when cleaning is due. Did I mention the warming spot where you heat up your cup while the machine heats up in the morning? Just brilliant!

For an affordable home machine, the Breville Barista Express is definitely a 5-star purchase. If I can figure out how to post a photo, you will see why I think it does such a great job."
4361,5.0,2022-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine!! My prior espresso machine was an entry level Saeco and I had to buy preground coffee since I knew NOTHING about grinding beans! I’ve had my machine about 5 months and have dialed in my favorite beans - LaVazza Extra Crema - although I’ve discovered some independent bean roasters through some YouTube channels (check out Hoon’s Coffee - he teaches you the ins and outs of this machine!) - and now I enjoy the best espresso I’ve ever had, every single day! I absolutely love this machine and it’s worth more than the MSRP!!"
4362,1.0,2016-09-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"BEWARE! Breville has recently ended its relationships with authorized local service and repair facilities and now does all repairs itself from a location in (I think) California. The minimum charge for a repair is $235, and the repair is guaranteed for only six months. I regard this as a huge rip-off, The machine I have had to be repaired - locally - twice in three years, and it needs to be repaired again (not enough pressure), but I am throwing it away instead. I won't play game with Breville's cynical ploy. Sure, their machines make good coffee, but so do lots of other machine that are more reliable - and less expensive."

4365,5.0,2019-01-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have the previous generation since 2011 and it still produces amazing results. To those complaining of grinder making nice, that is a coffee problem as sometimes coffee contains a small stone or so from the producer. Clean it out of grinder and you'll be fine.
I usually make 3 to 5 cups a day for the last 9 years. I don't use the frother as now days you can have a great separate one like the once from nesspresso. Mostly I drink espresso anyways.
Back in 2011 this was the best 480 USD spent. Still worth every penny at current price."
4366,5.0,2018-09-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I read alllllll the negative reviews and decided to take a chance since there were so many 5 star reviews. After unboxing and reading the quick start instructions I made a really pro quality shot of espresso and it was easy! My general rule of thumb is that you have to be about 10% smarter than the instructions that come with a given piece of equipment. The same is not true for this. This thing is just dummy proof. The negative reviews baffle me. People saying that the machine is messy or inconsistent or blah blah blah. Some people shouldn't fix their own car, and even beyond that, some people shouldn't make their own coffee for the same reasons! The first shot I made with the machine was outstanding and everyone since has yet to disappoint. Took me two tries to dial in the coffee grind and amount of grinds. I'm ecstatic about saying goodbye to Starbucks. At prior levels of consumption this baby will pay for itself in 4-6 months, and that estimate is even based on using top shelf beans. Don't hesitate to give this machine a shot. I will update this review if my opinion changes but as for now I'm stoked."
4367,5.0,2015-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine! I've had it for a couple of months, and have enjoyed loved it. I had an Breville Infuser first, but I couldn't make quality espresso without using their pressurized baskets. I returned it and thought about getting a Racilio Silvia instead, but I began to wonder if my grinder wasn't the problem. It is a conical burr grinder by Cuisinart, and I worried about spending the big bucks on a new espresso maker and still having poor results.

Instead, I got this machine so I could be sure that the grinder was up to par. And YES it is. This machine has been making excellent espresso about 3 times a day for the past couple of months. I couldn't be happier. I roast my own green beans weekly and there isn't a chain coffee shop around that comes close... only the few high end shops scattered around the country have me beat.

Anyway, just to test my earlier theory about the grinder, I use my old Cuisinart conical burr grinder for decaf, and the pressure dial always stays low and there is no crema. That grinder simply can not get the job done. So I am lucky I chose this machine with the built in grinder over something like the Sylvia. Also, if you think you might save money and get the Infuser, you'd better be ready to drop another $200 - $300 on a grinder than can do what you need. Otherwise, get one of these and you're good to go!"
4368,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,All I say is this is a machine that makes best cappuccino and espresso you can buy. 👍

Replaced a fifteen to twenty year old espresso machine that was working but had a bunch of moving parts that make it time consuming to set up and especially to clean. Also had to use a separatel grinder which added to the time and cleaning.

The machine was easy to set up, defaults sets were a good start, and it worked even better when I finally read the instructions. The built in grinder is a breeze to adjust and use but it will overflow. I put a small saucer under the grinder to catch the over flow. Then after tamping down the ground coffee, I add the overflow coffee back for the correct portion. Works well.

The only small problem is the instruction asks for 30 lb of pressure to compress the coffee puck. Have no idea how to achieve or measure 30 lb of pressure. For me still a little hit and miss on the compaction. The little gauge in front is a great indicator that seems to be dead on.

Compared to my old frother, the the frothing wand is light years better. I can achieve a foam or froth that will match Starbucks, and maybe better. My old frother created larger bubbles that tended to breakdown quickly while the Breville creates a super, fine bubble, or foam that will last to the end of the cup. Cleanup is about two minutes. The machine is so easy to use we are having lattes nearly daily instead of special occasions as with the old machine.

I was concerned about some of the negative comments posted here but so far have not had any problems. Did have an early problem with portion control of the ground coffee but then realize, after reading the instructions, that I had make an error in set up. After that it worked fine."
4370,5.0,2019-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had this unit for over 6 1/2 years now. It has been a workhorse. I make lattes every night and it has never failed me. Now, it is older and is starting to show its age, but that is to be expected. Any time you look at reviews this it is always the top unit for home use, and for good reason. Built-in grinder is great. Easy to use and consistently pulls a good shot. If someone tells you the shot is bad, then it’s 1 of 2 things: 1) the coffee is not freshly roasted, or 2) the grind setting is not correct. The only down side to this unit is that it is only a single boiler. Frothing takes a little while, but at the price point, do not hesitate...buy this."
4371,2.0,2018-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought from a brick and mortar store, Sur La Table. I wanted to try it out based on the high reviews from Wire Cutter and Amazon. I've worked at starbucks for 3 months so I am pretty familiar with professional grade machines.

The Design is compact which saves counter space, but gives you little space to work with while on the machine.
The steam wand takes 20 seconds to heat up, and the first use it spits water out, which would go into your drink which is not desired.
After heating your milk, you need to wait 15 seconds before you can start pulling your shot, in this time i found i would grind the beans and tamp in order to not be standing around, but still is a little annoying.
The steam wand is not very powerful at all. It takes about a full minute to heat up the very small carafe of milk which is only enough for one small latte, and the wand gets too hot near the rubber grip, so when I finish aerating and want to slide the carafe onto the shelf it always burns the milk when the wand gets deep into the milk. I wish the wand was more insulated and larger and more powerful, so that i could steam enough milk for 2 small lattes or one large, but it doesn't fit in the shelf area, and the wand sits too far an angle to service a carafe outside the shelf.
The water catch tray below is cumbersome to deal with and needs to be emptied after only making 3 drinks, as each time the brew or steam wand is used, as pressure water is drained into the tank below the machine. If the tray is pulled forward during its drain, the secret tools compartment will get water in it.
Overall the machine is workable but no wear near convenient enough for me to want to use it daily which was my goal in picking this up.
I have since heard as well that the built in grinder is not accurate enough to pull quality shots, which may explain why my shots were pretty bitter.
But the biggest reason by far: the latte I made on the machine would frequently give me stomach aches. When useing the same coffee beans and milk for a normal coffee I had no reaction, but when useing the machine I owuld get stomach aches. My guess is there may be some cheaper materials in the machine that might leach into the coffee or steam when it gets hot, but I don't know.
Frankly I knew better than to trust this brand and price range for a machine designed to replace something that should cost twice as much, and I have decided I am going to wait one more year with regular coffee, and then upgrade to a quality 2000$ price range machine.
I also read bad reviews about trying to get parts for this machine, like the gasket that seals the brew chamber, and people saying it takes months which is not ideal. I asked about this at the brick and mortor store and they confirmed that they used to sell them in store, but recently they had sold out and did not know when they would get more in stock.

Anyways, back to regular coffee for me, and I will upgrade to a quality grinder and get fresh roasted beans for the local roaster to get my high quality experience, thanks for trying Breville, but China just doesn't cut it when trying to imitate Italy,"
4372,5.0,2014-03-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ditch Starbucks and make tasty drinks at home. A nice entry level model, as you can set the functions where you want them and lock ‘em in. The hot water feature is great for tea or hot chocolate, and it’s quick to heat up. I’m just too lazy to clean it. Otherwise it’d be stress free."

4374,3.0,2015-06-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The described coffee machine could be slightly different => the internal water filter is presented in mine (and the problem is related to that water filter)!

In reality I have SOLIS Barista Pro (Type 114):

http://www.solis-onlineshop.ch/fr/cafe/machines-cafe/solis-barista-pro

But if you check:

http://www.breville.com/european-brands

you will find out it's (a one of the names of Breville) for Europe.

Many complains come on pressure lost after some month(s) of usage (even with regular cleaning procedure).
I had such a problem too after about 8 months even in spite of the regular descaling procedure.

I would propose how it could be repaired but it requires opening of the coffee machine itself so it would (probably :) break the guarantee.

Symptoms: pressure is not enough during the coffee extraction process and (usually) you have a very loud noise of the pump.
Sometimes it started to be better after de-scaling procedure but goes bad in a very short time (could be next day).
There is no pressure bar numbers on pressure scale: so for me a normal situation (i.e. when pressure is OK!) if I get 3 marks (i.e. in a green ""espresso range"") on pressure scale with EMPTY (i.e. without any coffee inside!) ""double wall"" (pressurised) 2-cup filter basket. And very bad pressure situation: when I had less than 1 mark on pressure scale with EMPTY ""double wall"" (pressurised) 2-cup filter basket.

ATTENTION: the proposed solution requires opening of the coffee machine (by screwdriver!) so probably it breaks the guarantee!

How to ""repair"":
As someone correctly noted (in reviews) it could be the water tank is not correctly settled by you (or empty) => the same symptoms you will have: decreased pressure and loud noise of the pump.
Now even after you ""shaked"" the water tank and sure the water should go easily in internal tube (for pump) it does not improve the situation.

So the second ""barrier"" on water path is an internal ""water filter"": a small transparent plastic reservoir with a ""sieve"" (a small metallic grid with tiny mesh size) in the middle.

But to have an access to the internal water filter you need to open the coffee machine by screwdriver:

- remove screws under water tank (back wall) - they are covered by 3 decorative plastic caps;
- remove screws from below part (stand);
- probably if you remove top part (cup warmer) it would be easier to get in - but in my case I didn't remove the top part;
- unscrew water connection socket from back wall - from inside;
- in my case I also did: unscrew power transistor (but before you need to unscrew a plastic cover of that transistor) from stand (stand used as a radiator for transistor) - otherwise it's difficult to get enough space to work.

So you see pipe from water tank connection socket and the next part on this pipe is this internal water filter.
This filter is connected from both sides to plastic tubes (one side directly to water tank connection socket) and tighten by plastic attachment clips.
In my case (after 8 months of usage - even with the regular cleaning descaling procedure) I've got a ""scale"" (or ""limescale"") on the mesh which reduced drastically the waterflow. So it was very similar as a bad water connection to water tank.
So I cutted the plastic attachment clips (they are standard and could be easily bought) from both sides and disconnected plastic water tubes from both sides of the internal water filter.
In my case there are two marks on this water filter - small marks but visible: ""1"" - internal side, ""2"" - side to external water tank connection socket.
And the internal ""sieve"" of the water filter is well visible in the filter water holes (the ""limescale"" on the ""sieve"" was easily recognised too).

Then I've put the water filter in descaling liquid for some time.
And then I cleaned the filter (in opposite to normal water flow direction - i.e. from side 1 to side 2!) by flowing water and by blow.
And connect it back putting two new attachment clips.

Then get together full the machine (in reverse: electric connection, socket for water tank connection, back side, below part - stand).
And made a test: the EMPTY ""double wall"" 2-cup filter basket => the pressure gives 3 marks on pressure scale (and noise of the pump was a normal one)!

ATTENTION once again:
But as you see to clean up this internal filter you need open the coffee machine!
So the idea of a water filter is good (in general): lets hope it will save for a longer time the pump itself :)
But inaccessibility to get it easily for maintenance apparently breaks any sense of that (or you need to ask Breville/Solis/Gastroback/etc to make such a maintenance - hope it was not an idea behind to get money on that :).
And of course I will need to repeat such a maintenance from time to time.
Hope at least after 6 months of coffee machine work :)
As I see it really depends on water quality and de-scaling procedure frequency.
But after all you can't avoid it unfortunately.

Another solution is to remove completely the internal water filter => but I have a doubt how long time the pump will survive without a similar maintenance. And as far as I know it's more complex...at least more boring as the pump has more tiny details to be cleaned."
4375,5.0,2016-03-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just made a cup of coffee. We've had this machine for a few months and I realized how good a decision it had been and I logged in to Amazon just to leave a review.

If you're on the fence because of cost compared to a drip brewer, or because it's harder to use than other ways of making coffee, my unsolicited advice is to just do it. Treat yourself. You wouldn't be reading this if you didn't love coffee. Stop drinking okay coffee."
4376,1.0,2016-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As they deceive the buyers, NEITHER IS THE BRAND, NOR ANY OTHER DELIVERS THE TEMPERATURE THAT THEY SAY TO HAVE TO EXTRACTION (198 degrees F to 200 degrees F) A GOOD Espresso COFFEE, I have already checked several brands and IT DOES NOT GO FROM 146 degrees to 150 degrees F, EVERYTHING IS NOT MORE THAN PURE PROPAGANDA TO SELL YOUR PRODUCTS"
4377,4.0,2018-08-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"4 1/2 Stars. We bought our Breville BES 870XL about three months ago. Everything works beautifully with the exception of the ""grind quantity adjustment"". This part of the machine seems to have a mind of its own. It takes two or three grinds before the adjustment takes effect. For the most part, I leave the setting close to the minimum (about 1/8 of maximum). Even so, grounds tend to spill out. This is a minor irritant and definitely would not stop me from buying this unit again."
4378,4.0,2020-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,We do appreciate the Barista. Good working machine plus received it in2 days as guaranteed.
4379,5.0,2022-07-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love it and thought Id share why I personally bought it.
1. I can walk away for everything except frothing milk! I have three little kids so I OFTEN overflowed my $200 machine because it was running, I stepped away for a ""second"" to grab something for them and turned back and oops! Anyway I can hit the grinder and walk away and I come back to it stopped with the perfect amount (programmable so its the perfect amount for you too), then I can hit the button which I also changed the programming on to fill the espresso and WALK AWAY. None of the $200-300 machines stop automatically. (I do have to stand there to froth milk but I'd prefer it that way and you have to upgrade a lot further to a super-automatic to get that feature.)
2. Its actually fun to fiddle with the settings. Probably not for you if you don't like to tweak stuff.
3. The dial at the front is so helpful -recently I started to get over-extracted coffee, (so I'm going to have to fiddle again) but I would have never known on a $200 machine where I was at if I started adjust the amount of coffee, the pressure I tamped, etc....

Finally the best advice I can impart is buy it at Bed bath beyond with a 20% coupon! Their receipt acts as the ""warranty"" because they will take it back for YEARS later if it breaks and you have the receipt."
4380,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The best expresso machine all iN one ever made for home use!! I had this unit now for about 2.5 years without any issues and I bought it Refurbished as it was a little bit cheaper and came with 6month warranty and I gotta say it is very very very reliable and excellent. It makea excellent expresso latte cappuccino etc... I do the cleaning with phosphate free tabs every time the light lights up, and periodically I do a general cleaning of the machine and the burr grinder cleaning as per the manual and I gotta say it works great as of the day we bought it, also just in case something fails on this machine all the little tiny parts are available to buy for quite fair $ and you can replace it yourself if you are a techy like me although I never had to dp any of that yet. I had tge keurig machine and it didn't even last 1 full year before it quit and we do make alot of coffe about at least 4 cups daily plus on weekends we tend to make about at least 10 cups because our family comes over and they always want my lattes because I roast my own coffee fresh ➕ with this breville 870 everyone always tells me its mich better than dd+Starbucks put together, this has been a true work horse for me and I love it and would recommend to anyone trying to make their own expresso latte or cappuccinos"
4381,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had this machine for a few years and it worked excellent. I dropped and broke the water tank and went to their website to order a replacement. Came in pretty fast and was super excited to have my machine up again. After about a month of use I noticed the water looked weird. Went to change the filter and found that there was rust all on the screen. The original tank did not do this after years of use so I'm not sure if they changed the parts or not. The water is now coming out discolored and there's probably further damage inside the machine. Contacted Breville and all they did was send another replacement tank which is fine, but im not drinking from that machine until I know if there's rust inside as well. Then I was told that they can check it out but they have to charge me a fee. So I have to pay brevile to check my machine for damage that their replacement part caused. Will never buy from brevile again."
4382,5.0,2018-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is fantastic. Have had it 3 years. I conservatively estimate 2 espressos per adult per day, for $0.15/cup. We usually have more. It’s also our tea machine (via hot water spigot).

Today, I thought I’d killed this machine on which our household runs. I had followed my cleaning instructions, but I had failed to include the soaking-water-filter step in those instructions. The spouse-who-tinkers gave it a shot and FIXED IT!

Seriously, always soak the water filter.

Looking forward to another three years of outstanding espresso."
4383,5.0,2018-05-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had the same machine for a decade. I
will never go back to brewed coffee. The Breville customer service is great. My family members have purchased 4 as a result of using mine."
4384,5.0,2018-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have one and it's a great machine. Steep price compared to some of the $99 pump machines, but the Stainless Steel construction and features makes cleanup a lot easier.

There's tons of like-able features, the handle on the reservoir is quite well designed. There's a hidden storage area behind the drip tray (which automatically pulls out when you pull out the tray). The top serves as a cup warmer. The automatic grinder is nice which you can override at any time.

The hot water spout is nice for making cafe americanos (i.e. regular coffee). The steaming wand gets a pretty fine foam for good cappuccinos or lattes.

There are only 3 gripes:
-To get the single-wall cups to work, I have to set the grind setting at 2 (pretty low). Took me a while to figure it out, but you'll get a much better brew with the single wall cups (you're relying on the grind to provide back-pressure rather than the cup). The double-wall (pressurized) cups will still give you a decent cup (i.e. starbucks quality), just not the best.
-By default the machine is configured to make a 1oz shot, usually shots are 1.3-1.5oz. Fortunately you can reprogram the quantity of water each button does, but it requires work.
-The dial on the side is governed by switches. If you don't rotate the dial all the way (until you hear the click), the steaming/hot water won't activate.

But overall it is a great machine!"
4385,5.0,2017-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I used to use K-cup machines. But never again. That coffee tastes terrible. Now that I have been using this machine I can’t go back to K-cups because it makes the best tasting “coffee” ever. If you are new to this, there are many videos out there that help the novice (and then there are the stupid videos - so stick to the professionals). It doesn’t take long to figure this out and the manual is wonderful. I use this for espressos, cappuccinos and Americanos. And the flavor is absolutely wonderful! My husband and I will never be able to drink another cup of coffee from any other regular coffee brewing machine. I don’t have to waste my money at a high end coffee shop thereby recouping the cost of the machine.

Update: 3/17/21: Still going strong, never have any problems and love the coffee! Now that I have said that, if anything does happen to this machine, I will definitely buy another one."
4386,5.0,2019-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Well I've had this machine for a year now and it's used 1-2 times daily and 6-7 days a week. It's still going strong with the occasional cleaning which is effortless.

I've aged coffeee my entire life until I took a trip to Russia in 2014 and had a mind blowing Capuccino in St. Petersburg. I was determined to experiment with shot pulling and sampling fresh roasted beans and I haven't looked back. I've mostly ran Lavazza and Illy through the unit and results have been very consistent. The only inconsistencies were due to my own errors.

The machine looks great in stainless and the functions, while basic, give you enough flexibility to pull great shots. The machine alerts you via a light when a cleaning is required which is you simply placing a cleaning tablet in the portafiler and running the clean cycle. An occasional decalcification is recommended which is simply a special solution run through the water tank and you're done. I use filtered water so I tend to only do this once a year.

Anyways a great machine that produces great shots. All that's left is for you to practice your techniques. I'll definitely get an even higher end Breville down the road once I've graduated my own personal coffee school:)"
4387,5.0,2022-07-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been using this machine daily for about a month now. It makes fantastic espresso, but it was a little difficult to figure out how to use it. I had to watch a few YouTube videos to get the process down. The frother and grinder are both very capable, and it pulls excellent shots every time.

My favorite feature is the super fast heat up time and the automatic 1 cup of hot water dispenser. I can make my double shot and put the water in for an americano faster than a Keurig can make a cup."
4388,5.0,2016-12-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love espresso (real espresso) then I decided to buy this machine hoping to have a great Italian tasty coffee. Fortunately, It gave me exactly what I desired, this machine is incredible and Starbucks Whole Beans Veranda tastes so sweet and delicious with this machine. The only problem was that I got obsessed to draw great designs in my coffee... I've spent a lot of time on youtube learning about barista techniques and how to stream milk perfectly. One and a half month later trying and making mistakes, I think that it is getting better. This by far the best coffee machine that I've ever had!"

4390,5.0,2016-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First, we waited a year to get this beautiful piece of equipment. We had another brand years ago, and it lasted about a year and then quit. I have heard great things about Breville, on social media, and then my son bought one. They made us coffee each time we would visit, and we knew then that we had to have one too! I can tell you that this is my husbands pride and joy. He makes it every single day, sometimes 2-3 times! It is a beautiful piece of equipment, and does what it says it will do. I am looking forward to many years of beautiful expresso experience with this jewel."
4391,5.0,2017-11-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"At first I will admit this machine was intimidating. I didn’t know if I had made the right purchase. I have a barista background, however I never had to mess setting much.

Once I got the hang of it, and got all the setting right for my favorite bean it’s been absolutely amazing. My shots are perfect every morning. It tastes just like a cup from my favorite coffee shop.

What I really like is how easy it is to clean. I had a less expensive espressso machine before and I dreaded making anything with it. This takes minutes to clean after every shot. And when it needs a deep cleaning it tells you!

I highly recommend this machine to anyone! For those who are frustrated, don’t give up! You’ll get those settings right and everything will be okay!"
4392,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We purchased the Breville espresso machine 6 or 7 months ago and have no regrets! Not only has it saved us so much time and money because we aren't going to starbucks everyday, but my lattes are even better! I can't function without my coffee and this machine is so easy to use once you get the hang of what you're doing. we haven't had any issues what so ever so we will definitely be replacing with the same machine when the time comes."
4393,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was purchased from Amazon as a gift for me. There is already a long review on here about this machine and I totally agree with it. Go read that one. It is elegant and comprehensive.

We did a lot of research before choosing this machine and I'm so glad we did. We have a Breville drip coffee maker and the espresso machine is a beautiful compliment. We use it multiple times a day. Yes, I'll agree with one of the negative reviews, in that we probably went through a pound of beans getting the hang of it and understanding how to get a good pull. However, we are now able to seamlessly switch between beans with almost no issues."
4394,5.0,2016-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Perfect for the amateur barista! This definitely isn't a plug and play machine. You'll have to spend some time dialing in both the machine and your method before you start to get consistent results, but it's super fun if you're interested in the intricacies of making coffee. The manual it comes with is great as well. My only ""complaint"" is that the portafilter it comes with has a bit smaller diameter than the average commercial size, so getting enough ground coffee in it to pull big, full-flavored shots can be tricky. If you like a Large latte in the morning, you may just need to pull a couple extra shots to get the strength you'd expect from your average coffee shop Large."
4395,5.0,2017-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love this espresso machine! We use it twice everyday and when we host friends sometimes we make as many as 8-10 drinks in a row with no issues. The ONLY downside is that the milk frothed can be hard to clean. I wouldn’t say this is a system issue, but rather me need to have the proper cleaning supplies handy. We opt for americanos in order to avoid frothing/steaming any milk."
4396,3.0,2017-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am a true lover of really ‘great’ espresso. I currently own a Nespresso Le Cube and have longed to improve upon the taste created by Nespresso. It is my desire to make a cup at home that is just as good as some of the coffee shops that I frequent (not Starbucks). I’ve been researching the Breville BES870XL Barista Express Espresso Machine for months. Much to my delight my wife gave me one as a Christmas present. Let me disclose, at the start of this review, that I am no barista and have no prior experience pulling espresso. I have read many of the reviews, both good and bad, about the Breville BES870XL. So after unpacking the machine I dutifully studied the instruction manual from start to end. I even searched and viewed numerous YouTube videos and read countless Web articles on proper techniques necessary for the art of pulling the perfect espresso.

With hours of researching and years of tasting I feel qualified to know what I want in a great cup of espresso. I headed off to the market and gleefully purchased a 12oz bag of fresh beans. Now I was ready to make my first espresso with this machine. Long story short, my excitement diminished when the first cup came out tasting like crap. Not to be too discouraged I adjusted the grind and tried again. And again the results were less than desirable. I reread the manual, studied the troubleshooting section, searched for other Web articles, and watched more videos. I bought more beans from other sources, made sure that I got only freshly roasted espresso beans. I even purchased a pre-ground can of Illy, just to verify my grinding abilities. After about 2.5lbs of grinding more beans then experimenting with taping, adjusting coarseness and varying fill amounts in the portafilter I finally pulled a worthy espresso. My creation was richly dark and had a quarter inch crema. It extracted midway in the grey range on the pressure dial within 26 seconds. Consistently I am now able to do this.

Even though I am able to make, what visually looks like espresso, the taste is not really there. Don’t get me wrong it’s not bad, but not what I was shooting for with the Breville BES870XL. During my learning and experimentation process I purchased 3 bags of fresh beans from 3 different shops, which in my opinion make great espresso. However, using the same beans as my favorite shops, I am unable to reproduce the same great flavor of their espresso. Not even close.

Today, after 4 weeks and 6 pounds of trying in vain, I decided to throw in the towel and admit defeat. My wonderful Christmas present was returned to the store and I am back to my reliable and consistent Nespresso machine. I cannot justify the cost of the Breville BES870XL. I was hoping to reproduce a great cup of espresso, only to be discouraged.

In summary:

Can you make a good espresso with the BES870XL? The answer is ‘it depends’ on your definition of ‘good’. Actually you can make a ‘decent’ cup with a lot of practice. But you can’t make a ‘great’ espresso.

Is it worth the cost? Well you will have to justify that. For me, the answer is ‘no’. It is not consistent and each bean requires a different setup."
4397,5.0,2014-04-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've followed the care and cleaning schedule from the manual, and this thing still works as it did on day one. I don't usually leave a lot of rave reviews for things, but this machine deserves one. Would recommend.
A couple tips: It uses the same charcoal water filters as Keurig and you can often find them cheaper than what Breville sells them for. Also Cafiza sells 100 cleaning tables for the same price as 8 of the Breville brand tablets."

I’m going to upgrade and as long as this company is making machines, they have my money.

Update: I watched a few YouTube videos and I was able to repair myself. She is still going strong."
4401,5.0,2017-10-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had my machine for over 3 years now. It works just as good today as it did the first day I got it. I can make latte art with the foam it produces. the grinder is still working great, no issues or complaints of any kind. this is a great introductory machine to the world of espresso. Now that I have mastered it, I am wanting to get a Rocket... Ah maybe one day. Until then, I LOVE the Breville. Get this one, you wont regret it. I get local beans from a shop here in my area, I have used bottled water the entire time I have had it, I do the recommended cleaning as in the Manual. I have never had to descale yet."
4402,5.0,2020-07-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought the predecessor to this maching (the 860, but looks almost identical) for my wife's birthday almost 4 years ago. For the price and the quality of the espresso it produces, hard to imagine anything better. Only this year did the rubber ring/seal finally go (causing leaks and grinds to spit out). Unfortunately, I am still waiting on the replacement, but that is the only problem in 4 years of almost daily use, multiple times a day. I was actually pleasantly surprised out how inexpensive the replacement parts were (2.99 for the new rubber ring), assuming they get it back in stock.

A few pointers to the buyer: 1. Do not get any moisture in the bean grinder, it will jam up and make an annoying clicking sound, forcing you to dis-assemble the grinder with beans still in it, usually making a mess. 2. Clean regularly with the tablets. Its easy, but the tablets are a little pricey. 3. Every few months run a half water/half vinegar solution through to eliminate deposits (both the brewing and wand).

Overall, I cannot say a bad thing about this machine. It has paid for itself many, many times over."
4403,5.0,2014-02-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"EDIT: I have had this machine for 3 years now and still use it on a daily basis. Friends & family consistently say it is the best coffee they have tasted. I have since experimented with several different beans but always come back to Illy (I have a subscription for it now which saves a lot of money!) I literally never go to Starbucks now and prefer my own coffee over the shops. Follow these steps and you will love this machine! It really is amazing! :)

After twice daily use and one cleaning cycle with this machine, I think it's about time I write a review. A little background: The minimal past experience I have working with espresso is due to a very basic machine my family owned when I was young. I have always loved coffee, but drinking espresso was special. It was so creamy, so indulgent, so rich. It was everything I loved about coffee tenfold. So after being a Starbucks Gold member for many, many years, and after ALOT of research, I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase this machine.

Obviously the machine is aesthetically gorgeous. It is mostly stainless steel with an attractive espresso extraction pressure gauge and user-friendly buttons and dials. Beyond looks, the pressure gauge is extremely useful in giving you immediate results in the quality of your tamping (and other factors), which is something I appreciate.

Regarding ease of use, the instructions provided in the Breville pamphlet are simple to understand, and if you follow EVERY step involved EVERY time, you will consistently pull a great shot of espresso. When done right, the espresso is very rich, bold, and flavorful- with a beautifully thick crema.

Important things that I have learned:
ALWAYS warm the portafilter and the coffee cup prior to use. This is a big one and usually was the problem when I had just an OK cup. I will usually rinse the coffee cup in hot water in the sink and then run the hot water on the machine through the portafilter and into the cup. Then I leave the cup with the hot water on the warming tray until I am ready to use it. FYI- If you like your coffee piping hot like me, you can also adjust the settings to make it brew a couple degrees hotter.
I tamp the coffee down more than once if I need to so that the coffee is well packed and encourages a good extraction (just not too packed that water can't pass through!)
Utilize the ""Razor"" tool provided- it takes the guesswork out of having the correct volume.
Pay attention to the pressure gauge-- it is your friend! Adjust your tamping pressure (and possibly grind fineness) according to the gauge.
Always flush the group head (and steam wand) before and after use to prevent clogging. FYI, the steam function remains paused for 7 or 8 seconds after you turn it off, which makes purging the wand faster if you are quick.
Use FRESH and QUALITY whole espresso beans- stale coffee will screw up everything. I haven't experimented with different coffees much, but I have always had fantastic results with Illy. Avoid an excessively oily bean and DO NOT use pre-ground. It really will affect your crema and overall taste.
Grind fineness is also important to understand. Just know that grind can be manipulated based on the taste of the espresso- assuming you are tamping correctly. If the shot tastes too bitter, increase the coarseness of the grind which will therefore decrease the brewing time overall as water passes more readily through it. If the espresso tastes a little boring or sour, it could be underextracted, and by making the grind finer, you prolong the brewing time and pull a better shot. Avoid grinding to a total powder. If it doesn't taste right, make a small change in the grind size each time and see if it improves.
Don't just change your variables at random- you will get frustrated and want to give up! Decrease your chances of failure by using fresh quality ingredients and by not taking shortcuts. Observe what is missing in your cup, do your research, and change the possible culprit one thing at a time. You can do it!
*Obviously I am not a professional by any means, but I did want to pass these tips on if it helps someone else.*
One last tip- Youtube is AWESOME! I learned so much from watching videos and actually seeing the techniques up close for myself.

Back to the machine- Overall, I have been very pleased with this machine. I appreciate that the grinder places coffee directly into the portafilter for a relatively mess-free experience. Clean up is also a breeze because the coffee grind is literally always a very dry ""puck"". Just a quick rinse of the portafilter and I'm done. This machine really does take care of itself- it even has a little sign that pops up and says ""Empty Me!"" when it is time to empty the excess water tray. And additionally, the cleaning cycle was straight-forward and instructions were easy to follow. The whole process including cleaning and dusting the conical burr grinder took 20 minutes. It was a little confusing trying to put the components of the grinder back together, but I eventually figured it out. Don't forget to change the water filters too! Take care of your machine and it will take care of you.

The *one* complaint I have is a minor one, but sometimes when I am removing my portafilter from the group head, the basket detaches from the portafilter and gets stuck on the group head-- at which point I have to twist and untwist the portafilter a few times until the basket reattaches. This problem is not frequent, however, and usually can be avoided by confirming that the basket is totally clicked into the portafilter each time and by applying a down pressure as I remove the portafilter.

Overall though, this machine is a wonderful value that has already paid for itself. We use it two to three times a day every day and it never fails to make my guests smile and feel special. It has produced better cups of coffee than other people's 1k fully automatic machines and allows you to actually BECOME a barista and learn the art of good espresso- a skill I particularly value and would love to be good at. If you want to just press a button and magically have coffee fall out, you may not like this machine- But if you have a passion to learn about coffee, you will love this machine. It really is fantastic.

Will I keep this machine forever? Probably not. I could see myself getting more experience and eventually upgrading to a machine with a faster steaming time (this one takes a good 45 seconds or so), a double boiler, and perhaps a higher-grade grinder- my reasons for saying this has less to do with taste and more to do with time, as making multiple drinks for guests does become time-consuming. But this is an AWESOME starter machine for novice coffee enthusiasts that want a short learning curve to professional taste- plus you will enjoy the learning process along the way. I have now moved on to mastering latte art! Good luck and happy brewing!"
4404,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Breville never disappoints. After our Breville Cafe Roma espresso machine finally died after 11 years of heavy use we were distraught because we were afraid we wouldn’t be able to find the same quality in the newer machines. We already had a burr grinder but the combination of the two seperate machines and the mess created was making my wife and I crazy. We decided to splurge on the one thing my wife and I highly enjoy, fine espresso. This machine is excellent. It looks amazing in our kitchen, manages the mess well and was easy to set up and program. I highly suggest Italian roasted beans(most of the beans are shipped to Italy from Columbia) such as illy or Lavazza. We buy our lavazza beans from amazon through subscribe and save and we rarely need to be concerned about not having enough coffee. This machine is well worth the money."
4405,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is one of the best espresso coffee machines I have ever owned, especially for the price! I absolutely love the fact that this machine grinds the coffee beans right then and there, and you use it right away. The overall taste of my morning coffee has improved 100%! There are so many choices for making true espresso that this machine offers: Light, medium, dark and strong. The frothing of the milk is excellent and adds that last touch that all respected cappuccinos must have. At first it seems complicated to use but it is actually very simple. I always use filtered water to improve the taste. The machine does make some noise but that is to be expected. Be careful as it does send a lot of water inside at the bottom of the grill that collects water. I empty it after ever use and keep it in top working condition."
4406,5.0,2017-10-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Only get this if you're willing to clean it. It's not complicated or hard to clean, a deep clean probably takes 15 minutes.

Once you do that, you're going to love this. We make coffee twice a day, for two people. Each drink is two double shots. We have saved so much money on coffee. To shock yourself, calculate how much you spend on coffee a month. Then divide the current price of this by that, and that's roughly how long it'll take to pay for itself. Beans aren't too expensive. We buy a 2.2lb bag for like $15.

You won't regret it!"
4407,5.0,2017-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this machine in late 2013, and always maintained it as directed (albeit with generic cleaning tablets and water filters). It’s provided great service, producing about 4 lattés per day.

In mid-2019 it developed a water leak from under machine when it was under pressure. Breville recommended shipping it back for service, at a flat rate of $239 plus taxes. About 2 weeks later, a brand new 870XL arrived.

If this machine has features you like, I recommend buying it. It’s a good value, and they stand behind it."
4408,4.0,2020-05-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great product. It works well and creates terrific espresso. The built in grinder is excellent. Still figuring out the best amounts for different beans, but very pleased so far."
4409,5.0,2014-02-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"havig received this 3 weeks ago I cant attest to long term reliability, but everything so far has been everything I could ask for.
1.The grinder has an excellent range from too course to overly-fine, i found optimal beany taste around 3.5.
2.It is ready to brew 30 seconds after power-up.
3. The steamwand is gnarly. Swivel to the side It works like every other, but when I'm lazy I can set the pitcher on the grate and it swirls and steams pretty well with a few pokes. You can't brew or use the hot water spout while this is going down, but the grinder works so it's never bothered me.
4. Pretty much everything can be adjusted in some way to be what you want. I've fiddled around and gotten a dozen different combinations of temperature, volume, grind courseness, packing pressure and coffee mass just because it's easy/fun to do.
Picture is the 2nd shot I pulled. Probably a little underextracted, but tasty as any"
4410,5.0,2013-11-23, Black Sesame,"I’ve owned mine for over 6 years an it’s such a daily part of my life I’d be lost without it. Sure you can nit pick it for whatever imperfections you may need to obsess on: coffee grinder can be messy, finding the right grind and amount of coffee for that perfect pull takes practice.... in my view that’s the fun and art of it. For those who are bothered by these just buy the fully automated machines.
I did have one issue after two years, a flaw with the water container, but Breville replaced it. No problem. You do need to clean it properly to avoid lime build up, but that’s part of any machine. Ok, I’m ready for a double shot bulletproof!"
4411,1.0,2018-05-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We really liked this machine for the first 9 months we used it and then it started making a horrible mechanical grinding sound when the water would flow. We decalcified, ran the cleaning cycle, changed the filter and nothing helped. So we flushed it out several times. Nope. We hoped in time it would just sort it's self out. It just got worse.

A bit of background on the maintenance of our machine: I'm a stickler for having a clean espresso machine and had been running the cleaning cycle every 2 months, decalcifying as recommended in the booklet and changing the charcoal filter regularly. I have only ever used filtered water in it. It has been used at most once a day to make a double shot. Basically, it's been pampered.

We googled the problem and discovered a Youtube video of someone demonstrating the exact same issue. There were dozens of comments from other people who had the exact same issue. Breville had even stated to one of them that it was a known issue.

So about a month ago, we gave up and called Breville, at this point the machine is still under warranty. We called them at 2pm EDT on a business day and their phone lines were ""closed"". Tried again the next day, same thing. Even though their automated closed message says that they're open til 5pm. We tried again the next day and finally got through to someone. Before they would do anything with the machine she wanted us to try some alternative cleaning methods, which she said she would email to us. The email never arrived.

I then emailed them to chase them up, I got a response 5 days later saying I'd need to call if I wanted assistance.

We then called again yesterday, where we got the whole I'll email you some cleaning instructions and if it doesn't work call us back AGAIN. We finally got these instructions. We were instructed to run a cleaning cycle 3 times in a row. We did that, it made the sound worse.

Called back again today (this is now the 5th time we've called). Only for them to tell us that they no longer replace these espresso machines if they're faulty, even though it states on their website
""Your Breville® product is covered by a one-year limited warranty from the date of purchase.
Should your Breville product have a defect in product material or workmanship within the first year of purchase, Breville will arrange to have your original product returned to us, and will deliver an identical or comparable replacement to you, free of charge.""

Instead all they'll do is offer to try and repair it, we have to send it to their repair center where it will take over a month for them to repair this pile of junk. If that fails then we're on our own. They said, alternatively, we could contact the retailer for a refund/exchange. However, because Breville have now screwed us around for SO long, our machine is now 3 days out of warranty so I doubt the retailer will help us.

I am so upset with this purchase and will never buy another Breville product. Their customer service is despicable."
4412,5.0,2017-05-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. I've had for few years without any problems and still getting great espresso. My family loved it so much i bought this as a gift for them as well. I did notice that if I use cheap brands (like starbucks,coffee beans...) the pressure gage never goes up no matter how I adjust the grind and amount. I stick with illy for the most part."
4413,5.0,2016-08-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was a barista, trainer, and manager at a large coffee corporation that rhymes with barsucks for 3 years. For the price, this is one nifty little machine. I have used it everyday since i got it and my girlfriend loves having homemade lattes every morning before work. Also it’s nice knowing that you aren’t getting DECAF espresso shots because you are making it yourself. Do yourself a favor and stop spending $6 on a coffee at Starbucks considering 80% of the time that barista is giving you decaf anyways. trust me I know from personal experience, that’s what they do 😘"
4414,5.0,2020-02-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Got this as a Christmas present. Before receiving, I researched some background information on making espresso. On my first brew I hit the middle mark on the ""extraction gauge"". This is definitely a quality product. You can see the small touches that Breville added. Espresso taste is amazing and making one in the morning is very easy even when trying to satay on-time. I was expecting to take a little longer and become stressful as a morning ritual but to my avail it is very simple.

Some notes:

Quality of the bean actually matters. Use something along the lines of StumpTown or Verve. I understand that some people are stuck in the Starbucks hype but these other independent roasters make a huge difference since their product is not mass produced. This makes a huge difference during the extraction stage and in the quality of shot. The fresher the bean the more oil in it.

Make sure the grind is set correctly. Espresso is a fine grind. This will equate to more pressure during the extraction process.

For a majority of the people having trouble with extraction, it is because they do not have the grind set correctly. Try using 4 as the grind setting. If you get an over-extraction bring it up to 5. Also, if you have too little coffee your extraction will be low same goes for the stamping pressure."
4415,1.0,2018-07-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have the machine for almost 3 years. It was working fine until recently start giving more hard time to make a cup of coffee. The extract programs and pressure is not working properly and it does not hold the pressure. Every time I reset the machine to the manufacture programing and program it, it keeps and continue to extract the coffee nonstop. Additionally and sometimes it does extract the coffee only for 6 to 8 second. I recommend not to waste your money and buy this machine. Very disappointed."
4416,4.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It takes time to adjust, but once all done you get good espresso"
4417,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Produces very good lattes much more consistently than my 15 year old Starbucks Barista machine. The pressure gauge is useful, it gives a sense of whether the grind and tamp are correct. The styling looks like something out of George Jetson's futuristic kitchen-- not the industrial look I prefer, but still an attractive design. Many very convenient features such as the magnetic holder for tamper, easy to remove water reservoir, and auto shut off. On the down side, when making steam, there is a thumping noise that sounds like a miniature pile driver on the kitchen counter, but it is not too loud and Breville says it is normal. (And, still much quieter than my Starbucks machine.) Finally, I could not reach Breville ""sales"" extension to order replacement water filters, was on hold for 10 minutes before giving up, but was able to quickly order parts after choosing the ""customer service"" extension. In fact, the customer service rep threw in a cleaning tool and manual at no charge, so very happy with the customer service."
4418,3.0,2022-08-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First let me start by saying that this machine is great, it makes great coffee, it's easy to use easy to clean and easy to maintain WHEN IT WORKS! so why 3 stars, I understand that parts break, I am also very tech savvy and can fix most things myself, which is why when water was starting around the coffee filter, with a simple screw I saw that the seal ring around it is damaged and needs replacement. Now not talking about if it's a design flaw or not, this machine is less than a year old, and been used daily. So I go on Breville site and find a link to purchase
54mm Steam - BES860XL/02.6 for $2.99. $3 sounds simple right? Well no since it's out of stock and I put my email to get notified, that was over a month ago. I also emailed costumer support and was told it would be back in stock (3 weeks ago). A quick search on ebay and other sites (even Amazon) will show you that other sellers are out of stock as well, and when they do get it in stock they charge as much as $20 for a $3 product and people buy it. Which shows me that this is an ongoing issue. I finally found a company in Canada and ended up paying about $10 per ring (bought 3) after international shipping.

So bottom line, I would def. not recommend this machine, although it's a shame. It's a great machine while it works, but having a $3 part prevent people from using a $600 machine for over a month is unacceptable. btw if anyone has this machine and ran into the same issue I will be happy to send you the link where I finally found the rings."
4419,5.0,2014-04-09, Black Sesame,"The Breville BES870XL is the upgrade from the BES860X, and it's worth every bit of it's ~$600 price tag! The purpose of the semi-automatic espresso is to have control over fine details involved in pulling a great espresso shot. This machine allows you to do just that. From grind size and grind amount, to pressure, shot volume and even water temp, the BES870XL allows fine tuning for each of these paramaters to pull the perfect shot. Breville is respected as a high-end kitchen appliance company, and their espresso machines are no exception. The machine comes with all the accessories to get started like a frothing cup, different size coffee filters, water filters, and cleaning supplies. This machine works great and pulls outstanding espresso shots. If this is your first espresso machine, it will probably take a few tries to get all the settings correct. Most home users are suprised to find how much detail goes into pulling a good espresso shot. One of the biggest variables is the coffee beans. You will probably have to customize the settings for different types of beans, as different beans, roast, brand, etc... will produce different results. This is common in high-end machines. So it's unrealistic to think you can set the machine for grocery store bought beans, then use the same settings for fresh coffee beans bought from your local coffee house. On that note, freshly roasted beans will use significantly different settings than grocery store beans. So if you are having trouble with pressure, timing, or other paramaters, the first thing to try is to change to a higher quality bean. Once these are worked out, this machine is as good or better than any professional coffee house espresso I have had. I highly recommend this product!"
4420,5.0,2017-09-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We received this espresso machine as a wedding present and it was hands down the best gift! We have used it every single day for at least 4 shots/day and it works flawlessly, making frothy, hot, rich espresso. It’s absolutely worth the money; we’ve saved countless dollars at coffee shops since owning this machine; it undoubtedly paid itself off."
4421,5.0,2015-01-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had my machine for about a year and a half. I am quite happy. It just works great every day. I love the flavor of coffee brewed under pressure, but I also like the volume of drip coffee. It took some playing, but for me, the best is a double shot of water with a single-wall, single-shot filter. Two of these cycles makes a mighty good cup of coffee; and it sets me up for my day."
4422,5.0,2014-12-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've been a barista for about 4 years now, and I've tampered with some other home based espresso machines with mixed results. I love this one the most! So, there are some obvious perks to this machine, the first one is the bean hopper. Using pre-ground coffee is one of the worst mistakes a person can make when it comes to pulling espresso shots. I want to make a note and say the grind size and dose must be calibrated. This will take both time and resources. I went through a half a pound of whole bean coffee when I was calibrating my machine. It comes with a double-walled and single-walled group heads. The double walled with create a significant amount of pressure, and aide in pulling more consistent shots (it even created a good amount of crema from my 2 month old beans). Even better, the milk steamer actually works, the tamp isn't half-bad either! This machine is great for the experienced espresso maker, and even better for those who want to explore the intricacies of the process. Would recommend, 10/10."
4423,5.0,2013-10-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,My several years old Breville had a problem so I emailed customer service describing it and received an email response the next day offering to replace it. I can't be happier with the new machine or customer service. They did a great job and I am a totally happy customer. I can't start my day without my latte.
4424,5.0,2018-10-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this model for almost 2 years now. It's made well, allows a fantastic mix of automatic and manual features, takes up little space considering all that it does, and has easily paid for itself a few times over since I can make espresso, Americanos and Lattes that are just as good, if not better than the chain coffee spots, with a little practice of course. It comes with what you need to learn the ropes and tools to keep it clean and happy. It's one of those rare products where the manufacturer just did everything really well, from product design to documentation."
4425,5.0,2017-02-03, Black Sesame,"Literally press ports filter for auto-grind and fill, tamp it down, twist portafilter into place, press a button and you have a perfect espresso. The milk frothier works beautifully too.

Reading other reviews it seems this honeymoon won’t last but at least for now we rate it 5 stars!

For reference my husband’s father has had the same model for 3 years with no problems."
4426,5.0,2018-06-27, Black Sesame,"I researched a lot before buying this machine. I almost bought a rancilio silvia, but this one, frankly, looked too cool, and seemed like it would be easier to use.

One year in, and we couldn't be happier. I still enjoy playing with the different grind settings and still have fun finding the right amount of espresso for optimal pressure, something that changes with each roast. I don't want to mislead anyone, you do have to play a little. I have found that the darker the roasts, maybe because the beans have less moisture, need at least 1/3 more ground beans, and you'll want the grind to be a little finer vs. a light roast, probably because the bean has retained moisture, will use fewer beans, the the grind should be more coarse. This is all a little technical, and not interesting unless you've already purchased the machine. Trust me, with a little patience, you'll quickly find the right measurement and grind

The hot water spout is another plus, we use the it to make tea, and Americanos.

Also cleaning is simple. I purchasaed enough cafiza cleaning tablets to last a lifetime, they were cheaper than anything breville offered (just another tip).

Once again, I highly recommend. I understand its expensive, but punch in some numbers using an online espresso machine calculator (they determine how much you might save on coffee), and I think you'll feel confident about throwing down on this machine or something comparable."
4427,5.0,2018-06-27, Black Sesame,"I was really impressed with the built in grinder! The hopper is removable so you can vacuum the burrs. The steam wand froths milk to perfection, but it does take quite a bit of time and water. I time my shots for perfection and it rarely changes with each and every pull. I love the option to draw hot water, it's perfect for steeping tea! This BES870XL is very easy clean and maintain making my morning routine quick and painless.

Overall, I am extremely impressed with this machine, the overall quality and value has me in awe. For me, this was an investment really. I also purchased a frothing thermometer, shot glasses and a stainless whipped cream dispenser with chargers. I no longer need to run to Starbucks every single morning, saving me a small fortune!"
4428,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my Breville, but keep having the same problem, little to no steam. It drips water or streams, but no steam. It worked great for about a year before the problem began. I religiously cleaned and descaled when the lights came on. The espresso part continues to work well. I sent it in about 2 months ago, received it back about a month ago and the steam was great. Starting yesterday, the steam was less and today only water coming out, same problem. The lights had not yet com on, but i cleaned and descaled the machine with no steam improvement. I am tired of wondering if i have a lemon. A relative of mine has the same machine, never cleans it and it works great. I want my steam back, can Breville please check it out again, or just send me e replacement, refurbished will work. Thanks for listening to my gripe."
4429,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First, I grew up drinking ""Turkish"" or ""Greek"" coffees which were oily brews with grinds in the cup and served with lemon wedges and sugar cubes. So I have used a French Press over the years to make such ""high fiber"" coffees.

Since most of America has no idea what a ""real coffee"" is and they think espresso should be served without grinds, I eventually was forced to adapt to Americanized espresso machines.

I had this coffee machine (which costs as much as a cheap Dell laptop) for a day and tried it on multiple grind settings with 5 kinds of beans for double shot espressos and despit multiple adjustments of grind, pressure and tamping, the coffee flow was consistent and sometimes the pressure would not function at all. Often I had to press the button twice to get water flow. Ultimately, I could not grind the coffee fine enough to make Turkish coffee and had to set the grind to an ""American course grind"".

As result of the machine not being able to handle a grind finer than a 4 or 5, the coffeee tasted horrible as it was too weak or too bitter.

I tried 5 different beans that used in other espresso machines and French Presses with no problems at all.

Apparently, this Aussie only likes certain drier beans as whenever I used really fresh oily dark roasts the pressure was insufficient and the puck was wet when extracted and the coffee was simply disgustingly weak or strong depending on the flow through the single walled double shot espresso cup..

The only beans this machine made a decent cup of coffee out of were some older and drier Brazilian beans and it abused my fresher Columbian, Nicaraguan and Honduran beans.

I adjusted the grind, the tamping and the pressure to no effect. The coffee pucks were soggy and the pressure flow was uneven and inconsistent across beans and with cups using the same beans. The burr grinder is loud enough to wake anyone sleeping in a very large house which probably is an indicia of the grinder's design longevity and mechanical design defects and under-engineering for sustained use.. The real killer was the inconsistent pressurization which will only get worse with time until the pump blows a gasket in relatively short order.

Given that I was raised on Turkish and Greek Coffees and only drank espresso because no one in America makes real Turkish coffee or Greek coffee with the grinds in the bottom of the cup for chewing, I decided to return it after one day rather than waste money and counter space on deeply flawed one trick pony espresso machine.

That said, If you use a rather light roast in a dry bean with a rather course grind, the machine works very well. However, if you have a very dark oily bean, it simply wont grind the bean coarse enough for the water pressure to flow consistently and forget about anything close to a Turkish grind as this machine will simply blow a gasket and you won't get any pressure or flow unless you pressurize the machine multiple times..

In sum, this Aussie is a one trick pony which is greatly over-hyped and for anyone who really likes real Greek or Turkish coffee, buy a cheap grinder and a French Press and you will get better tasting coffee with the grinds in the coffee cup with more consistency, less cost and less mess. As for frothing milk and making an OK cup of coffee with a course ground bean, if that is your requirements list in a nutshell, you very likely would like this machine. But if you are used to what real men drink, forget about it.

A much better cup of Turkish Coffee can be made with a $30.00 French press so I would save the money and forget about this machine."
4430,5.0,2015-02-10, Black Sesame,Great machine but you need to learn about dose and extraction
4431,1.0,2017-11-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,The worst investment and the worst customer service. I paid for this machine on Nov2019 $488.99 and calling to the worst supporting service from breville the repair cost $299 plus tax . Think before you buy this
4432,5.0,2015-07-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased ours from Bed, Bath & Beyond using one of their 20% coupons with it already on sale. I was not a coffee drinker prior because I wouldn't pay for it. Now I love my coffee because I make them how I like them. My wife and I have paid for it already in the past 6 months with having coffee a few times per week. My wife maybe more. It's the best purchase I made since I purchased my first minivan. Love it!"
4433,5.0,2017-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Really nothing to be negative about. Love this machine and researched You Tube for many hours. Built in burr grinder is a BIG plus on this machine...knew what it was when I ordered it. Bean source is very important and mine is over an hour drive, but... This machine is EVERYTHING it is supposed to be. Never used a double boiler machine so I am not spoiled.
ADDED NOTE: TO REGISTER WITH BREVILLE, THE FIRST 4 DIGITS OF THE SERIAL NUMBER, IS THE BATCH CODE...NO SALES RECEIPT REQUIRED TO REGISTER. THEY LOOK UP ON AMAZON"
4434,5.0,2015-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was a splurge, but the best purchase we have made. It is so easy to use (even with no background as baristas) and we use it everyday!!!"
4435,2.0,2016-06-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We had this machine for 4 years and enjoyed it a great deal. Make no mistake - it produces great espresso.

It stopped working well however at some point; evidently there are frequent issues with the solenoid valves.

Point of caution No 1: One has to ship the machine to Breville to fix. No appliance repair in town would touch Breville espresso maker - no parts, finicky etc.
Point of caution No 2: That costs $300 plus tax.
Point of caution No 3: The fix didn't work (no quality control?!) and now for the worst -
Point of caution No 4: The Customer Service is just a vicious joke. It is unresponsive, forgetful, dysfunctional, ignorant, confused and utterly unhelpful. So far we had exchanged multiple emails (when they respond), attempted to schedule conversations, etc. and haven't got any help."
4436,5.0,2016-09-07, Black Sesame,"Love, love, love. Looks professional and feels very sturdy. Got the black to match my kitchen decor. I look forward to coffee everyday now. Also been using it to steam milk for hot chocolate and we’ve also been practicing some latte art, one day we’ll get it right :D"
4437,5.0,2014-07-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is one workhorse of a machine. It's super easy to use & clean.
I just bought a new one ( I like the black color)
The one I bought over 10 years ago STILL works great, have never had any problems with it even with making 4 espressos or more every day with it.
If you want an easy to use, reliable machine, this is the one!"
4438,5.0,2021-02-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought it five years back and it’s still going strong! I am extremely impressed by the durability and quality of this. The espresso is still as good as the first day. I bought it for around $450 and it’s $700 now, so looks like I got a good deal!"
4439,5.0,2017-10-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine and the coffee (Americanos) it produces. Every bean is different so it takes time to find the right tasting bean for you and one that produces great Crema. Different beans require a different grind setting and tamp pressure to produce a perfect shot. Once you find that bean and get your technique right, you will be in heaven. 12 months in, my Breville BES870XL started with the dreaded solenoid buzzing noise and subsequent low pressure. The recommended vinegar descaling wasn't helping and there is no way I'm paying $250 to get this serviced. Someone mentioned using powdered Urnex Dezcal for 30 minutes, which I did, and voila no more problems! I suspect that vinegar isn't strong enough to remove the lime scale and calcium deposits in my machine, we have very hard water. Dezcal has citric and sulfamic acids which work better at removing lime. This machine has a stainless steel boiler and coil so it should be fine long term with more aggressive acids. Anyway, hopes this helps."
4440,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I owned the previous model of this machine which just broke down after 5 years.
It leaks from the valve assembly and can cause quite a mess. Customer service is never available like someone already mentioned.
The difference between these two are slow ramp up of the water which allows you to pre infuse the beans now and a bigger bean hopper compared to mine.
Overall I would still recommend the machine for the price because it's still a basic easy to use and master it.
For espresso I recommend 13 grind size unless the beans are oily than go course.
for a latte art pitch the pitcher on an angle and get a circular motion having the tip of the wand barely submerged.
It's a slow machine when it comes to performance so if you want to make bar quality espresso I don't recommend it cause it won't be achieved with these breville machines regardless what you buy if you want bar quality you need to spend more and look in to these Emc, profitec, rancillo, quick mill, espobar now we are talking in the thousands that's what I upgraded to Profitec 700 $2599.00 a latte takes me 3minutes from start to finish as long as you have a good grinder with it, mine its called t64. less than 30 sec to steam the milk to hot temp just to give you a comparison breville took me 8min for a latte total from grinding to the final product which was a latte my pict of that using the breville barista.
My mom she just purchased a breville but she isn't a hardcore espresso drinker.
Overall this machine will perform better than their competitors 1 push button machine in the price range. You will make ten times better coffees than Starbucks. Use lavazza gran crema bar, or kimbo extra cream, don't believe the bs that fresh beans will do the job, cause it won't if you want espresso you have to go with the companies that have been around and know what it takes to make espresso those I listed will do illy will not so well with this machine."
4441,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"WARNING: This product will forever ruin coffee of mid to low quality.

I use it every day and when I don't have it to make my morning coffee it causes me to fall into a slight depression.

All jokes aside, I absolutely LOVE this machine. It's a staple to my morning routine and the wife loves it too. After you get accustomed to using it, it will make all other coffee a little less enjoyable. I mean that in a good way."
4442,5.0,2016-10-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great solid machine. I received mine as a gift almost three years ago. It's a real work horse. You can pound nails with it all day long and at the end of the day it's still dead on. I just bought one for a friend since I've now bench tested teh machine's durability.

I use it every morning, pull two doubles and often leave it dirty until I have time to clean it. When we have company it gets more use. I don't mind the lack of the double boiler it just means waiting 30 seconds or so for the transition from steamed milk to coffee, but I'm mostly a milkless espresso drinker anyway. No complaints . . Okay, it would be nice if the water tank was bigger or if it could be run directly to the wall. That's the closest I can get to a complaint."
4443,5.0,2015-03-04, Black Sesame,"We bought this espresso machine about a month ago from friends who decided this machine requires too much operation to make coffee. They never used it, was still in the box, so it was practically brand new when I bought it.
I have some about 2 years of experience using professional semi auto espresso machine in office work environment. So I am not new to espresso machine.

The user manual is easy to read, and has detailed step by step procedure to install and make coffee.The manual would be perfect if the drawings are bigger and clearer. Some of the drawings are a little harder to visualize.

The grinder with the machine works very well, and was easy to adjust to the desired fineness. The right amount of coffee is automatically dispensed, or could also be manually dispensed.

Porta filter can be replaced easily for single serving or two serving filter, and easy to disassemble for wash. The group head works very well to deliver the right amount of water, at the right temperature, and pressure to yield good amount of crema. The pressure dial is very useful to indicate if ideal temperature, pressure are achieved during brewing.

The steamer works after about 7-8 seconds of flipping the steam switch.. which is pretty impressive given it is a single boiler machine. The steam is superfine and consistent (does not spurtr), and provides adequate pressure for steaming > 10 oz of milk.

For its class, I think Breville 870 is superb in making very good espresso and other drinks."
4444,5.0,2018-07-26, Black Sesame,Tengo dos años utilizándola... el sistema moledor me duró 1 año y ahora después de dos años y tres meses de uso dejo de salir agua caliente para calentar las tazas... sigue haciendo el café pero le cuesta generar la presión... la utiliza todos los días en la mañana y cada vez que hago reuniones familiares hago café para todos... excelente producto pero falta información para repararla... creo que con tantos cafés que prepare puedo decir que es una buena máquina!
4445,5.0,2020-12-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine has made my life PERFECT!!! I have made the best coffee every sing day, and friends have said I should have been a barista. Would definitely recommend this if you’re a coffee addict and are tired of spending $15 every time you go to Starbucks!"
4446,3.0,2018-07-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I absolutely love it for what it is. If I’d had the funds to purchase the dual boiler, that would be fantastic so that the espresso is not going cold as younfroth the milk, but the cost differential is huge. This little machine does a great job and the water reservoir is enough to last me about a week if I have a coffee per day with steamed milk. The one thing I have noticed is that the grinder dial can work itself onto a different grind size on its own with the vibration caused while grinding. I started noticing under extraction and couldn’t figure out how this was happening. Once you know the right grind size, remember that number. Then hold your dial in place AS YOU GRIND YOUR SHOT so that it doesn’t work itself off your ideal grind size.

Update: January 2019
I started with 4 star but I’m moving to 3...maybe should even do 2. It’s not cheap and it’s why I’m so disappointed. I was loving this but the other day, I was grinding beans for my double shot and the grinder ran out of beans. It spun without beans for a few seconds before I turned it off. No biggie, it has happened a few times before. But this time, when I added beans, no more grinding. Mother didn’t make a sound. Nothing. Silence. I took it all apart, brushed out the burrs and vacuumed just in case it was jammed. Still, nothing. It’s like the motor has simply quit. I’m super upset. Now I have this machine that probably can still make a great espresso but I have no grinder to make one. And putting another thing on my counter is super annoying and expensive. I wouldn’t do a 2-in1 unit again. I’ve owned this for around 18 months. So not worth $600 for 5 coffees a week over 18 months."
4447,5.0,2019-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this for my husband for his birthday as an upgrade to the 'beginner' espresso machine he had. He was skeptical at first, wondering how this would really be easier. But he LOVES it. He makes espresso, coffee, cappuccino, (and made all those the first day just to test it out) and loves how quick, easy, and comparatively (to our old machine) QUIET it is. Easy to clean, love the semi-transparent water tank, and he likes being able to control the grind. He also loves that he just pushes one button to make two shots of espresso - far easier than watching and stopping the flow manually, and with less mess. He also likes the storage in the base. I did ask him if there was anything he would improve - he did say it would be nice if it was cheaper! I say given my research before I bought it, it's great value for the money. Five stars. Disclaimer: We've only had it a week."
4448,5.0,2020-04-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Here's my 2 cents worth on my new toy which I've been using for a couple of weeks or so...

Love this machine! Plenty of reviews out there, most of them very helpful. The only thing I'd add is my experience in initially under extracting my shots. I was using whole been coffee (roast date???), fine grind (2-3), nice firm tamp, coffee level set with the razor tool, single wall double shot basket--all good, right? However, could never get the pressure much above the pre-extraction zone and shots would begin almost immediately with only about a 5-7 second duration. To confirm that the machine was OK, I used the double wall filter--all else the same-- and did register some pressure during extraction, so the machine was working.

Next step--bought some FRESHLY roasted whole beans, albeit for twice the price of my normal, ""best used by 2017"" variety. The difference was night and day! Everything now text book--color, crema, pressure level, extraction time, puck consistency and dryness post extraction--and the coffee tastes great!

So--love this beautiful machine! Next step is to work on my latte art for my wife's cappuccino!"
4449,5.0,2017-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent espresso machine. I love espresso and wanted to learn how to make them at home. This just about as much as I could justify spending. The next step up features double boilers and is more automatic, but start at 2X-4X the cost. Lots of research later and I decided to get this one. Very happy with this machine and would not hesitate to buy it again. If you're new to pulling espresso shots there is a learning curve and some variables that you have to learn to control besides the beans quality. However, that is precisely what intrigued me. I typically shy away from fully automatic things that take away the element of art and user control. I love to learn how and why things work and don't work. After a little while, you'll learn to recognize pretty quickly what you did wrong and why the taste is off. And you'll also feel pretty good about yourself when you begin to consistently pull very tasty shots.
This machine has not disappointed me anyway and exceeded my expectations."
4450,5.0,2020-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine does three things: grind, brew, and froth. It does all three perfectly. The grinder is pretty good, and I usually set it to 4-5 for fresh coffee, and 2-3 for decaf coffee. Fresh beans are of course a must.
The steam wand is my favorite. It's one of the most user friendly frothers I have seen. One small hole in the wand's tip give yo plenty of time to get it right, specifically if you are a beginner. Making latte art is easy to do with this machine even for beginners.
My favorite coffees are: Lavazza (super crema), equal exchange, both of which I purchase from Amazon, and for decaf, I have found only two brands which can actually produce nice crema: Mexican LLC, which I buy from Amazon, and Allegro which I buy from wholefoods.
By the way, the 2.2lb Lavazza coffee bag usually arrives at your door just one week after it's production date in Italy! Very impressive! The brands of coffee I mentioned are all mid-priced, making them a good choice for everyday use.
You really can't go wrong with this machine. Although some people complain about durability, mine has been perfect so far (6 months, three double shots a day on average)"
4451,5.0,2014-09-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Excellent little machine for the money. I’m a beginner barista and I’ve bern able to replicate mine and my wife’s $5.00 morning Starbucks favorites in our kitchen for a fraction of the cost. Plus, nothing better than some java in your underwear! Ha. Don’t wait, just buy it. (Was considering a much more expensive machine with stand alone grinder, glad I didn’t spend 3x the money)"
4452,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had this espresso machine for ten years - use it every morning for two double lattes; never had a problem with it, never had to replace parts or service it. Dependable, efficient, and has saved thousands of dollars in take-away coffee costs! You just have to know how to use it correctly, keep it on the right settings for you, and clean it regularly. Highly recommend!"
4453,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I THOUGHT I was good at making coffee.....UNTIL I got this machine. Oh. My. Gosh. Best coffee EVER. After practice-- and it IS a learning curve, every cup is almost as good as Avoca Coffee Shop in Fort Worth Texas-- which is 1000 times better than any Starbucks' coffee. Good to know: your coffee machine will only give coffee as good and fresh as the beans you buy. So expect to spend $ on your coffee accordingly (from a shop that roasts their coffee fresh on site at least once a week). If all you will buy is Starbucks coffee beans, save your $ and buy a less quality machine. With this machine, Even decaf tastes amazing because it's freshly roasted and used within10 days.)"
4454,5.0,2021-05-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was a daily Starbucks drinker and bought this to try it and it actually makes Lattes better than Starbucks. Buy some quality beans (I use Petes) and watch a video on how to use and you'll love it. Not sure about the negative reviews I've read since I've used mine for about 2 yrs and not had any issues. I clean it and descale it regularly, not after it breaks. It is kinda loud but who cares when it makes such great lattes."
4455,5.0,2015-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have had one of these machines for 8 years. I have never once had an issue with it. These machines are incredibly well built and are absolutely worth the price for avid baristas who want to get better at their craft
4456,5.0,2018-07-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Watched a couple of YouTube videos to get started. Can be easily customized for advanced use or simplified for beginners. Most used kitchen appliance in our household!
4457,5.0,2014-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this machine! It grinds the beans and makes one or two shots of espresso, practically hands free! This makes such smooth espresso. No more bitterness. I give credit to the awesome burr grinder. I was worried the water reservoir was going to run low too soon and be a pain to refill. But, no, it's super easy to fill, not reason to pull the reservoir off the machine to fill it. I like how self-contained it is. I was worried that this had steam on the right, where as, on the left is where my sink is located. But ths machine has a real nice built-in water catcher, that doesn't get full quicky. Cleanup is a breeze! We couldn't be happier with our espresso maker. Breville BES870XL.
Our first Breville. Love it. Oh, and I bought the Breville matching Knock Box. Perfect accessory."
4458,5.0,2018-10-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Fantastic little espresso machine. Love it.
4459,5.0,2016-12-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have a Gaggia Classic and a very good burr grinder, and I have pulled great shots. But after my wife gave me the Breville Barista Express for Fathers' Day I have to say that pulling a great Expresso or Capuccino is now easier than ever. When I started calibrating the machine I had to change the grind all the way down to 1 to get a fine grind that would create sufficient pressure in the portafilter to get crema on my cup. My suggestion: get some old/cheap beans to practice the grind and make sure you getting it right. Once you do it is pretty easy to replicate. I usually grind to the consistency of coarse flour and thump tight but not excessivelly. Also, while grinding the coffee onto the portafilter make sure you thump the portafilter on the side a few times so that the grounds accumulate nicely and do not leave a lot of air pockets. There is a nice video on the Breville web site where you someone is making an expresso using this machine and making a little ground coffee pyramid on the portafilter with the hand and then pressing the coffee. When brewing, if you see that the pressure gets to high and the flow too slow just increase the grind size and possibly decrease the weight you apply to the grounds. I am getting fantastic shots with ease. When making capuccino I usually froth the milk first and then brew the two cups of coffee. Good luck."
4460,3.0,2017-09-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine is ok. Looks better than it really is. Very overpriced. Received product brand new from Amazon, and after setting it all up, I was very disappointed to see that the key-featured pressure gauge did not work at all. I researched the problem on the web, only to see that many other people had also experienced the same problem, that the pressure gauge did not work straight from the factory while others complained that it failed in a short amount of time after purchase and use. I contacted Breville in California, only to receive some youtube video instructions on what types of coffee beans to use because using the wrong ones or stale ones would somehow cause the gauge to fail. Well, the fact is that I never ever ground any coffee beans, and that the gauge failed because quality control in China is bad. The company failed to correct this problem after receiving years of complaints about the same problem. So, Breville told me just to return the product at the store where I bought it, even though all the labels inside the packaging say not to do that. The company is horrible as is their customer disservice. Amanda Mosqueda, the customer service rep assigned my case told me that she took 3 days to respond to me because they were back-logged from the volume of complaints following being closed for Thanksgiving. While the product looks wonderful, it is fancier looking than it really needs to be. I am returning the product because the company who makes it really sucks."
4461,5.0,2019-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,First time using it and so far I love it. Made perfect espresso. I used Lavazza super creama beans and the double walled filter (again first time making espresso). Ising it was much easier than I thought.
4462,5.0,2016-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have had this over a year now and love it. The machine has performed flawlessly. I highly recommend. It takes a while to figure out the perfect grind for different beans however you can use the cheater double wall thing but I enjoy playing around.
4463,5.0,2018-07-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had it not been for a rock in a bag of silver hook coffee that we used (we had no other choice at the time) we’d still have our first one. It still worked good, other than the grinder, thanks to that rock. Sold it, and buying a replacement."
4464,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great machine that my wife loves. Biggest tip? Tampering. There are two ways to nail it. Way the first - use a scale. Go get your bathroom scale, put your coffe, in the portafilter, on the scale and push down with the tamper until the scale shows 30lbs. Do that a few times until you have the muscle memory, then do it on the counter. The second way is through feel. Pull out the portafilter once it's filled with coffee and tap it on the table to seat the coffee in the filter. Put your tamper on it and begin pressing down. You know you have hit the right spot because you will feel this ""give"" happen where there will be a sudden compression of the coffee under the tamper. Once you feel that ""give"", you've tampered right. If you can't feel that sweet spot, switch your grind size."
4465,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Hands down, one of THE best consumer Espresso machines.

Pros:
Looks Great
Makes Great Espresso
Grinds your beans just how you like them
Programmable control of the water timing

Cons:
Water tank is small
You often have to tap on the hopper to get beans to grind
No temperature control
Steam wand is small, not the easiest to clean... and takes a while to steam milk. The next model up is superb in this regard, but not worth the price tag.

All-in-all, this is a phenomenal machine, and you won't be able to make better espresso from something anywhere near this price point."
4466,5.0,2017-09-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I adore this machine. I'm on my second one actually. I did my research on Amazon originally and am SO GRATEFUL that someone suggested you buy this machine at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. a) You can use their famous 20% of coupon and b) if anything ever goes wrong, you can return it to the store; you don't have to pack it up and pay heinous shipping to return it to Amazon. After two years my original Breville Espresso machine had to be returned because no matter how many times I followed the cleaning instructions, I could not get the ""clean me"" light to go off. I took it back yesterday and Bed, Bath, and Beyond per usual, provided AMAZING customer service. They exchanged it, no questions asked. Because of their amazing customer service I a) buy ALL my small appliances there and b) keep all my receipts so that if anything ever happens, I can return/exchange the item, no questions asked.
Yesterday in the store, I saw that the model number and the machine itself were both slightly different than my original machine. I am assuming that these changes will all be for the better. Having just enjoyed my first cappuccino with my new Breville, I have to say, it tasted even more fantastic than those I was making with my first Breville. I am hoping that any and all bugs that existed in the old design have been eliminated.
For the record, I do not experiment with the different guages. I use the machine as is."
4467,5.0,2018-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,We’ve had the Breville Barista Express for 5 years. We typically use the manual options. Haven’t been the best about timely decalcifying but otherwise are good about keeping it clean. This machine is doing just as good of a job now as it was five years ago! We recommend this espresso machine to a lot of people who love coffee like we do!
4468,1.0,2020-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My husband bought me a breville espresso machine in 2019 and I was so excited. After about 4 month the steam knob would get stuck and it became impossible to turn. Even my husband who is quite a bit stronger than me could not turn it. We sent it back in under our warranty and Breville sent another machine, saying it’s something in the mechanics and never really told us what’s going on. The second machine did the same and now the third. This time they said they would not fix it. Very expensive machine to have the same issue over and over and each machine was new, or so we were told it was a new machine."
4469,5.0,2017-03-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Keeping me sane through COVID lockdown. So glad I bought this. It has already paid for itself. Takes a few mins to learn what you're doing, but you will be glad you did!"
4470,5.0,2017-05-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,The box arrived saying EXACTLY what it was so there was no surprise... I'm not sure why you gave me the option of hidden box if you were not going to send it that way.

Just saying...
4471,5.0,2017-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this as a gift for my sister so I can’t give a detailed review, but she loves it. As a former barista myself, I did a lot of research and found this to be one of the best at home espresso machines. So far, she says it is!"
4472,5.0,2013-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is pretty great as far as at home coffee goes. I've owned 3 previous and haven't been able to achieve anywhere near the results I have with the Barista Express. I make coffee as part of my livelihood and got this as a gift for Christmas.

I will say that the steaming side of things takes a little longer as this runs a thermocoil as opposed to boilers (which heats quicker) so the the Dual Boiler/The Oracle by Breville might be the way to go if that's what you're looking for. This is however half the price of those other 2 machines, so it is definitely one to consider if cost is a factor."
4473,5.0,2018-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,I have 2 of these machines. I took my 5 year old one to work and purchased a new one from Crate And Barrel for my home. It might take a little work to make your espresso but it is worth it. I had a fully automatic machine and it wasn't near the machine this one is. Easy to use. If you love a real espresso then you will love this machine!
4474,5.0,2018-02-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have been using this machine daily (sometimes multiple times per day) for over a year now and we could be happier, given the price. The grind settings can be a bit finicky, and you will notice that they need modified if you change the type/brand of beans you are using, but since I use the same beans 99% of the time, I can generally set and forget the grind settings.

My only complaint is the mess that the grinder makes, but I have accepted this as an issue that is likely present on any type of espresso grinder.

One thing to note - if you pull 2 shots back to back, the second is more likely to cause too high of pressure and not pull a shot, so I usually scrape a small amount of grinds off the top."
4475,5.0,2020-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After a few trials, found the best settings and the espresso is just the way I like it. Very easy to set up and operate. Great product!"
4476,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,The best espresso coffee machine ever! Love it!!
4477,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I had bought the Barista Infuser but that stopped building up pressure when making espressos, within a few days of use. Had to return it! Thought about buying a Breville again but decided to take a chance based on the reviews of this machine. And I'm glad I did! Its a great little machine. Looks good, is compact compared to other high end machines and delivers a perfect shot of espresso!"
4478,5.0,2017-10-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased for myself as a Christmas present. Came a couple weeks early so put it into action right away. Been through about 4 pounds of coffee since and have to say this machine is awesome. Reading reviews for a month ahead of time sort of scared me about whether I would be able to tune it in with all the variables involved. Took about 3 tries. Grind set to 6 on lowest grind amount setting to minimize making a mess with the grinds. Medium tamp puts the pressure gauge right in the middle of the espresso range every time! Changed coffee types twice and still right on perfect espresso every time. Has me scratching my head as to the general intellect of those who struggle with dialing this in? Unless your machine is malfunctioned in which case you would know right away, this machine is a breeze to use. I even taught my mechanically uninclined wife to make perfect shots after watching me only twice. Highly recommended, I just hope it lasts long enough to justify the price tag."
4479,5.0,2015-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this as a gift (lucky me) in the Black color. It is the most amazing present I have ever received. It is both easy enough to use for a novice while also allowing for more customization for those who know their way around brewing and want to play around with grind size and other settings. The espresso that it makes is very tasty, the milk steamer is great and easy to use, and the machine is easy to clean. To top it all off I think it looks beautiful in my kitchen and I'm proud to have it on my counter top.

This machine is undoubtedly an investment, but if you buy a coffee out and about more than twice a week, this thing will easily pay for itself in a year."
4480,5.0,2021-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine rocks!! I’m able to consistently duplicate awesome cappuccinos!
For the espresso, I use lavazza super crema beans and grind at a 6. I’ve adjusted temp to the highest setting. I always get a clean dry puck after brewing.
For the milk, I use 2% and froth until milk temp is around 150-160 F.
I’ve lived in Italy for 6 years and this cappuccino is the real deal! As far as durability, 9 months in with no issues."
4481,5.0,2017-12-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I use this machine daily and have had no troubles with it. At all. It lights up with a ""clean me"" light when it needs to be cleaned, the tools come with it. You can buy powder cleaner or tablets to clean the portafilter just about anywhere. The grinder does a pretty decent job and is adjustable. I clean the grinder and the hopper 1x a month or whenever I use an entire bag of espresso up. Just brush out the grinds, wipe it all down, and be sure not to put the hopper back into the grinder with any water left n it. Most likely this was the best purchase I have ever made and has saved me hundreds (I kid you not) of dollars by not going to coffee houses every day for my fix. Being a former barista I can tell you what comes out of this machine tastes exactly like the drinks you would get at the place with the mermaid logo. It just takes practice getting to know your grind and make sure your using a good espresso. The one drawback is it does get a little messy when grinding but not enough for me to take it down a star."
4482,5.0,2017-10-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have been in the coffee industry for 15 years. This little machine does the job and is comparable to the La Marzocco machines I’ve worked with and owned. Steam isn’t quite as powerful, so it takes a bit longer to froth your milk. But this little machine is perfect for home use! Love it!"
4483,5.0,2017-06-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had this machine for almost 4 years and not a single issue. I make 2-3 coffees a day and sometimes when we have guest 8-10.
Do maintenance on time and it will serve you long."
4484,5.0,2018-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love it so far and so happy I could figure out how to use it!! Coffee game changer!!
4485,1.0,2014-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased the Breville espresso machine almost exactly a year
ago. I have cleaned and maintained it per manufacturer
recommendations. When I went to clean it this last time, I found
something VERY DISTURBING. I discovered that my machine was
infested with WORMS. I have taken apart the machine the best that
I could to clean it, however, as you can see from the provided
pictures, the worms are all the way down in the machine to where
I can not reach there to clean or take it apart and further. This in fact is a manufacturer issue because the machine has a flaw. I have
done everything in my ability to try and clean this machine. I am
EXTREMELY concerned about my safety and health and pray that
none of those worms got in my coffee! I have been in contract
with Breville through email and phone call and they are not taking
my complaint seriously. They say it is not covered under
manufacturer warranty. The only thing they are offering is 40%
my next purchase. I DO NOT want another machine, I want them
to realize that this is a health and safety issue. BREVILLE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER FLAW AND IS REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. PLEASE CHECK YOUR MACHINES!!!"
4486,5.0,2016-11-10, Black Sesame,Huge fan! Worth every penny!
4487,5.0,2020-03-07, Black Sesame,I have had my machine for a year and half now. Grinder stopped working about 6 month again. Breville sent me a box and free shipping. They said three weeks. It was fixed in 3 days. Been great ever since. I make 2 cappuccino a day. Love this machine.
4488,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Like many others, I was reluctant to put forward cash toward an investment like this without knowing that i was getting a quality product. I even went as far as using this purchase as a Capital Project in my EMBA class. The object of the project was to show a payback period for the purchase. At the time while attending college I was visiting Starbucks daily sometimes twice a day. Additionally, my family was purchasing drinks on my card to the total of $1200 per year!!! So, I purchased this machine and it paid for itself in 90days!!! It has been over 3 years since I purchased it and it's still running strong! No issues at all. Best investment ever and Company loves coming over and getting a latte. Saves them 5-6 bucks."
4489,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When I began to use this machine, I wanted to master the use of the single-wall filter. I wasted nearly 10 ounces of beans before I got a perfect extraction with the right amount of pressure. I've been using Lavazza Super Crema beans and also PapaNicholas Italian Espresso (my preference is PapaNicholas, so far). I use the 2 shot single-wall filter with a grind setting of '4'. And I have my grind amount set to where I have just a little bit of excess and tamp it. Then I use the Breville Razor to trim leaving just the right amount in the portafilter. Don't let all the buttons and gauges intimidate you like it did me. Just dive in and follow the instructions and you'll eventually come to the realization that you've really got a very high quality machine that produces the espresso you deserve. If I could change anything, I think it would be the grind dispenser. It can get a little messy but its not really that big of a deal."
4490,5.0,2016-12-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I did not buy this from Amazon as I received it as a gift. But I can tell you that I am 100% satisfied with this machine. From the automatic grinder that stops grinding when the thingy is full, to the hot water and steam it produces. I have a cappuccino every evening after supper and have done so for the past year. Every cup comes out perfect. It is also the first espresso machine that I can foam the milk with. I've never been successful with other machines."
4491,5.0,2022-08-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My favorite drink that I make with this machine is a Mocha Latte Cappuccino, Heat the brew head and cup, then mix a teaspoon +/- Nutella mixed with a teaspoon of Hot water from the dispenser, then make a nice Cappuccino foam, and pull a 1 shot single filter basket into the Nutella mixture and add foam, for something different, One Change is add a 1/2 teaspoon of Peanut butter to the Nutella syrup mix you made.
I really like this machine it is Excellent!!!
I went from a entry level but modified DeLonghi EC155 and a good quality espresso grade coffee grinder to this Excellent!!!!
Breville BES870XL espresso machine
the difference is hugh the gauge allows you to get your grind size and shot size and tamp pressure dialed in
the worst shot pulled through the breville was by far better than my best shot on the ES155
I have had espresso from some superautomatic machines and they require less user interface BUT taste is sacraficed on the superautomatic machines since you have much less control
I want to see how long this machine lasts so far love this machine
it is a night and day difference"
4492,5.0,2020-03-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing machine. I’ve onlh had it for like 3 months but coming from a Keurig WOW there is no comparison. I used to make espressos, cappuccinos and lattes in a restaurant job I had years ago while going to school. As long as your beans are fresh, this is a great machine. If you use older or stale beans, it might be a little tougher to pull consistent shots. I love this thing, and I don’t even use the milk/cream steamer."
4493,5.0,2017-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Barista Express is a great esspresso machine in every way. I rarely give 5 star reviews but have to applaud the engineers at Breville for packing all the essential features to pull a fantastic espresso shot into such an attractive, functional and conveniently sized package. In my opinion this is the best machine in this price range by far.

Pros:
Attractive stainless steel finish.
Compact size fits under overhead cupboards.
Integrated grinder works like a champ, saves space and adds value. A good conical burr grinder is worth hundreds by itself.
Solid portafilter feels great in the hand and functions flawlessly.
Integrated removable tamper is actually a quality device unlike the plastic ones you get with other machines.
Includes a hot water dispenser as well as a steamer. Great for americanos or hot tea.
Pressure gauge helps you refine your barista skills by giving instant feedback on each shot.
Adjustable in just about every way including grind size, grind amount, temperature and shot duration/quantity.

Cons
Like any machine in this price range it is a single boiler. So if you make tons of lattes at once get a separate frothing machine or go for a dual boiler espresso machine.

This machine has taken my appreciation of coffee to a whole new level."
4494,5.0,2017-08-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome machine. Easy to use and makes a great at home espresso bar.
4495,5.0,2017-08-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"it works great. it replaced my 18 year old espresso machine a received as a wedding gift. this is so much better. its a bit, no a lot more work and you have to dial it in with different coffee but well worth it. call customer service before you buy. they were wonderful about answering all my dumb questions."
4496,5.0,2018-05-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very smartly designed and compact, but powerful machine. The operation is no different industrial type coffee machines. It has pockets for storing everything conveniently. We are using it for 2 years now, not a single day of hiccups. You may want to buy a milk thermometer seperately."
4497,5.0,2021-12-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"i juat got this 3-4 weeka ago , i am impressed by quality of the machine and coffee it makes ! amazing coffee its takes couple days to adjust settings but its worth every dollar u spent ! will recommend to my friends and family!!!"
4498,5.0,2016-12-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought Breville Barista Express for my husband who is particular with coffee. After struggled for a few days getting the right extraction time, he has been making great cappuccino everyday. The machine is easy to use, easy to clean and most importantly, it makes wonderful cappuccino. It's a very attractive design also."
4499,5.0,2017-04-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wanted to get a nice espresso machine that wouldn’t break the bank too bad, this was the best choice out of the many I studied up on. The only downside is how small the shots that are pulled are, I wish that there was a little more to them."
4500,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,This machine convinced me that anyone can be an expert barista!
4501,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great little machine to do the trick at home. But if you dont know how to pull shots or know what good espresso tastes/looks like you should probably practice before dropping over 600 bones. Even as an experienced barista it took a few tries to find the sweet spot. Also the steam wand is a lot shorter than what I'm used to and takes longer to bring the milk up to the temp i like. Solved that problem by buying a cappuccino milk jug. If youre looking at this machine for your business, keep looking. Youre better off just spending the couple thousand dollars to get a really good machine that you dont have to refill with water everytime you use it."
4502,5.0,2016-03-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,Had this for 3+ years. Awesome experience. Breville engineering is obviously superior.
4503,5.0,2016-08-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent espresso maker! Makes coffee shop grade coffee drinks. Love it! Would buy it again. A year in. So far so good.
4504,5.0,2016-02-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So happy with this product that I'm writing a review 3 years after purchase. My husband and I have been enjoying double cappuccinos virtually every day for 3 years since I gave the Breville to him as a gift. He is in the restaurant business and we were spoiled for several years prior with a true professional grade ""hand me down"" espresso machine at home. When it finally gave out, we couldn't afford a legit new professional grease replacement. After shopping around, I bought this Breville and have been 100% satisfied ever since."
4505,5.0,2017-01-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this 3 weeks ago and have absolutely loved it! I use it twice a day, everyday and have no complaints so far. I was a barista for 6 years in my younger years and this machine puts out a pretty decent shot. The people complaining about finger prints and marks- well it is stainless steel. It's prone to marks. I however, have had no issues. I guess my only complaint is it does seem the water reservoir does empty quickly, but you fill a coffee pot daily yes? And at an actual espresso shop, their machine is hooked up to water- and the machines cost 6-10k. I am using whole beans too."
4506,5.0,2013-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this machine after reading a recommendation in a facebook page which finds great bargains on amazon.
This machine is amazing! the coffee tastes great and it's very easy to master the process and functions to make the most of it.
I would definitely recommend this machine, coffee became a hobby for me and I get to explore amazing coffee because of it."
4507,5.0,2016-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is one very good espresso maker. I am two months into using it on a daily basis, and so far it performs as expected. Professional grade, and the built quality is excellent. The only downside from my perspective is the water tank size. Even though it's sufficiently large, the machine's water consumption is high. The tank needs be refiled frequently, and the bottom tray cleanup also becomes a pain. Overall, a great coffee maker.

Update 7/19/2018

Still running great! I have nothing to complain about, as it performs well consistently. Still using it on a daily basis, several times a day. This is one of those good old solid designs that you do not see often nowadays.

Update 9/18/2021

The machine is still running great! Besides really minor performance issues, everything works well. Reliable, and the coffee tastes delicious!"
4508,5.0,2022-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Beautiful machine that won't break the bank. Gets the job done and I have no regrets!
4509,5.0,2020-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great product for cappuccino and espresso, the price is quite high though."
4510,5.0,2017-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Still making what I consider excellent espresso after almost two years of daily use (probably four or five cups per day). The pressure seemed to stop working as others mentioned... what was actually happening is the grinder needed cleaning and the grind was too course.
The ability to have hot water after about 30 secs is a great convenience for making americano. Instructions are very good. Look for generic reservoir filters and cleaning tabs as the Breville brands are way too expensive. Fit and finish on the machine has held up well. Good job Breville on a quality design!"
4511,5.0,2017-08-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Haven’t gone out for coffee since getting this. Still adjusting which brand of coffee to get (some make a better puck than others). The angle for the milk streamer takes some getting used to - but everything is stellar so far. I really have no complaints about this machine.
4512,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have this espresso machine for over 7 months! We love it!! We appreciate the original espresso taste and the professional cappuccino!! We absolutely recommend it!
4513,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Play Video
 Love this machine! I use it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day."
4514,5.0,2014-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,I received my Breville machine as a gift about 8 years ago and it still works perfectly! I make one or 2 lattes everyday and it does a fantastic job. I had a couple other machines before this one that were in the $200 price range and they all quit after a year or two. This is the best machine that I am aware of in this price range and I would never buy a different one. I love it! Well with the price.
4515,5.0,2016-09-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing
4516,5.0,2017-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Easy to use. Very customizable. 100% recommend and worth the price.
4517,3.0,2016-08-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is messy. It wastes your expensive espresso beans. When you use the built in grinder, it grinds so much coffee that it piles up and spills off the side.

Yes you can set it to grind less, but then you're likely to find it doesn't pull a good shot. The directions say to set the grind at 5 and to set the amount that it will grind at 3 and I have found that if you vary from these settings then the pressure doesn't build up enough for the gauge to show that you're pulling a good shot. The directions to say that this is just that these settings are just a starting point and that you'll have to adjust them as you go along. I've had my machine a little over a week and right now it only gets 3 stars from me.

I do find machine to feel heavy duty and sturdy. I do like that. The machine does come with a nice amount of accessories.

I'm not fond of the little razor thing used to trim excess espresso because when you do so some of the espresso falls off.

To be continued."
4518,5.0,2020-08-04, Brushed Stainless Steel, I haved three years with my machine .
4519,5.0,2021-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Works as advertised. Happy with this product. Well made machine and many online videos are available and helped to understand how to get the proper grind and extraction.
4520,5.0,2015-04-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Near professional capability and zero waste (other than grounds). Very intelligently designed, we use multiple times almost daily for over 3 years -- just add water and espresso beans!"
4521,5.0,2018-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Es la segunda máquina que tengo de estas y es lo mejor
4522,5.0,2015-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am thoroughly impressed with this machine. We have debating over whether to buy an espresso machine for about a year now. We were close to buying a Nespresso pod system but ultimately did not want to be stuck into buying pods. So we researched machines and landed on the Breville. It has run perfectly on a daily basis for 6 weeks now. No quirks. The handbook is detailed and answers every question a first time espresso maker could ask. And definitely worth the extra money to have grinder built in. As a mom of two, it is so nice to wake up and make a latte at home while the kids play instead of bundling then up and going to Starbucks. And our homemade lattes are better than store bought now!"

 Excelente expreso machine. Fresh coffee every time!"
4524,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I made around 1700 espressos and still going strong!!!!
4525,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I was hoping to get this espresso machine for a long time. It meets all my expectation. It is well designed. It is great for family use.
4526,5.0,2014-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I am going to buy by second one from Costco
4527,5.0,2020-08-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Makes delicious espresso drinks like the professionals. I am very pleased with the quality of the machine and the quality of the coffee product it makes. I am expecting many years of service from this item, it is very well constructed."
4528,1.0,2017-09-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"BE CAREFUL WHO YOU BUY THIS MACHINE FROM! Our machine developed a problem with the magnetic valve, we called customer service at Breville, very snotty people by the way, and they tried to trouble shoot the problem. Not something that can be fixed by us. Breville WILL NOT honor their warranty because we did not buy the machine from their APPROVED sellers. So we have to pay to have the machine fixed. So, what we have is a four month old, six hundred dollar piece of crap sitting on the counter taking up space."
4529,5.0,2021-05-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had this system for about a year now and it is fantastic. There was a little trial and error period, but once I got all the settings tuned to my liking I get a fantastic espresso every time!"
4530,5.0,2018-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Been using this thing for a few months now and love it. Definitely 5 stars, but if inally found one flaw a FYI to others. I joined a fresh riasted espresso beans club, and the beans they sent me this week were harder than anything I've ground before. The burr grinder seizes up with these hard beans. My other dedicated burr grinder (that my wife uses for drip coffee) was able to handle the grind no-problem. So I'd say the burr grinder is slightly underpowered. I'd still buy this again; really love it. Makes better espresso than I can buy anywhere with a bit of practice and geeking out."
4531,5.0,2017-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is enough pretentious comments to drown in, so I’ll just cut to the chase. It makes great espresso, steams and grinds well too. I love it like I would a child from my own womb. I miss it when I’m out of town. I’ve hauled it on vacations all over. Great deal. You’ll love it!"
4532,5.0,2016-12-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine as a whole is great. My first espresso machine and I love it. Make frappes and lattes like a pro. It is a little loud at first, but quiets down."
4533,5.0,2022-04-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is solid, well built, quick to boil the water and get the steam ready

The crema it produces(assuming you use fresh beans, tamp properly, use the manual override for proper pre-infusion time) is tall and rich.

I can pull a professional quality cafe shot out of this every time and the hot water feature makes for fantastic Americano.

I'm kind of a coffee geek now, thanks to this machine

The ONE thing I wish I had was the Breville grinder. The built in is awesome on its own but if I had a separate grinder I could use different beans without having to use whatever was left in the hopper at the top.

Advice: buy this
- buy >>Roasted On<< date fresh coffee
- start watching YouTube videos of pulling espresso shots and steaming milk
- enjoy!"
4534,5.0,2017-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,Couldn't believe that a machine at such a good price range would generate such good quality coffee. Espresso is perfect and steamer is a bit slow but for at the end makes a perfect froth.
4535,5.0,2016-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Such a great machine! Well worth the price and makes great espresso
4536,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine was my gift to my husband for Xmas. What a hit!!! He loves it and uses it every morning for himself and we use it at dinner parties. It’s good looking and has a clean, professional look to it as well. The coffee is delicious! In addition, the machine was shipped and delivered exactly as requested and in perfect condition. I couldn’t be more satisfied."
4537,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As long as this machine keeps doing just what it's doing now, it gets a 5 star rating. I've always loved espresso and have bought several machines in the past. I gave up buying machines and trying to make my own when the last one, along with the others I bought, didn't meet expectations and eventually broke down. That was about 10 years ago. When I read recently of the Breville Barista ratings for a home Espresso maker, I had to try again. It is Fantastic! Best one I have had and I'm crossing my fingers that following the instructions on up-keeping the machine after daily use, that that it will keep doing it's amazing job!!!"
4538,2.0,2019-06-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes a good espresso. That's why I decided to get this as a gift for my brother. At the time of ordering, all the Amazon suppliers of this machine had unreliable ratings. Not wanting to risk any complications with the delivery or product, I decided to buy directly from Breville. How ironic that my Breville experience turned out to be some of the worst customer service/policies that I've come across.

1) My order was cancelled with no explanation, so I had to investigate on my own why my order was cancelled and re-order, which was unfortunate because the purchase was made as part of a time-sensitive gift. A $90 deduction for my inconvenience was offered without my even asking, so I was still a satisfied customer at this point.

2) The unit arrives and is dead on delivery. After reading the user's guide front to back and trying everything to fix the machine, including buying a can of air and blowing the unit out several times to no avail, the customer support agent unapologetically told me I just had to keep on tweaking the machine because ""that's what has to be done with all new machines,"" and she promptly hung up on me, telling me to ""just continue trying.""

3) After 3 hours of trying to ""fine-tune"" the machine and calling customer service for the 7th time, I'm finally offered an exchange, and only after asking to speak to a supervisor am I offered any ""compensation"" (expedited 2-day shipping and coffee beans) for the overhead of having to exchange the machine. I was definitely frustrated at this point, but just wanted to get the machine up and running for my brother.

4) A week after the ""expedited shipping"" date, I again have to proactively contact Breville because the unit has still not arrived. I'm told the unit was ""lost"" (blaming FedEx) and that a new unit can be shipped, thus negating the ""expedited shipping"" that Breville had supposedly offered as compensation for the dead on arrival unit. They claimed to then ship another one ""express,"" but in the end it was not until TWO WEEKS later that the unit finally arrived.

I get a clown show in return for trying to buy a $600 espresso machine? High end machine for low end incompetent/unprofessional service. I'm glad my brother has a nice espresso machine, but I won't be purchasing from Breville anytime soon."
4539,5.0,2019-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,We have had the older version of this machine for over 9 years and we very steady use it’s still working like new. Great quality for the price. Would definitely buy again
4540,5.0,2014-12-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this a few years ago and it's still working as well as the day I bought it. You have to use the cleaning tablets and the water filter every 2 months or so. The machine will let you know which is nice. The process of making coffee is not totally automatic you have to experiment at first especially if you buy different coffees with the grind, some coffees need to be coarser than others. Some are oily. I'm using Lavazza beans and they work great. The gauge is a big help in determining how well your coffee will come out. The amount of pressure you put on your tamping matters but I think the grind is more key. The only thing that is disappointing about this maker is the coffee grind mess that falls in front of the maker. Maybe the drip tray should extend out more. I bought a bar service mat for the front to collect the grinds, milk, etc that accumulates and I'm happy."

This one is absolutely perfect. I've had it for just under one year now and still use it regularly. It's easy to set up, use, and clean. I was able to get the hang of it in under 10 minutes, and both my roommate and my mother, neither of whom had ever used an espresso machine, learned how to use it almost as quickly. I highly recommend this to anyone, regardless of your level of coffee experience."

The first few days I tried it using ground coffee and I didn't like the latte. I ordered organic beans and they make a lot of difference. I am still experimenting different levels of volume, grind size, and frothing which adds to the fun of making latte at home. If you are a beginner like me, I highly recommend this machine for experimenting and learning to make perfect espresso drinks."

While still looking for a totally automatic espresso machine I took out my back-up Breville CafeRoma.espresso machine ( I CANNOT go without my daily 'machiato lungo streto',). It's your standard machine, but it makes a great coffee.
One thing led to another...I found the Breville Barista, semi automatic, on sale, and decided to give it a try.
WOWW!...What fantastic espresso.
I tried them all....streto, lungo, machiato, coretto, cappuccino, and latte..and all are simply outstanding!
You're still getting the coffee ground fresh, and all you have to do is tamp the filter holder and lock it in place...that's the semi automatic part.

4544,3.0,2016-07-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"REVIEW AFTER WEEK ONE

I bought this thing a week ago (honestly, not on Amazon... Bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon for a total of 513.00) and so far I can say this massive purchase has been totally worth it. I am getting beautiful shots with the ""tiger"" effect and they taste just as good as the espresso in the best coffee shops in my area. The grinder on top of the machine is a huge plus. I read some reviews that said it wasn't a great grinder, but I don't understand why. The quality of the grinding is far superior to any burr grinder I've used. Also, The machine is super easy and fun to use...

A few complaints -- as others have mentioned, the reservoir for water is a little small so it runs out often. And even though this machine is pretty high-tech, it doesn't alert you when the water is out... I accidentally tried to make a shot with no water in the machine and that's definitely not good for it. Best thing you can do is make a habit of refilling the water every time you use the machine so this doesn't happen. My second complaint is that I have only been able to pull great shots with the dual filters (the ones for espresso newbs) and no matter what I do I can't get a great one with the regular ones. And finally, the steam wand is super loud. I feel like I am gonna ruin my ears over time with this thing! However -- One of the reasons I went with this machine is Breville has excellent customer service. I know that if any issues should arise, they will try to make it right which gives me great peace of mind.

UPDATE: A few weeks of having the machine... I decalcified it according to the instructions... And now the steam wand is no longer working. It has been a little finicky since day one -- sometimes it doesn't turn on at all and other times shoots out water for a long time -- but now it is shooting out straight water constantly no matter how long I preheat the machine or run the wand. Seriously? It has been not even a month! Contacting Breville on Monday..."

I was told to replace the silicone ring, so I did with no results. I called Breville customer service and they want $239 to service my machine. Are you kidding me?!! That’s a 1/3 of the price of a new machine. For what they want to charge for a new machine, one would think the machine would last longer before a major malfunction. I’ve owned a few espresso makers and they lasted a good eight years before I had to replace them. This was a great espresso maker when it worked. However, with that said, I feel the durability is lacking and should have lasted longer than two years. Especially for the amount of money they’re charging. Buyer beware, once the warranty is up, the cost to fix it is expensive and quite ridiculous. I’m now looking at other alternatives to replace my Breville as I’m not going to fork out another $600 for a machine that won’t last."

i had a semi-auto that i used a few times a day for years and got a super-auto as a gift to 'upgrade'. I used it for a while but found that the espresso was weak and watery tasting; so i sent it to the manufacturer, convinced the machine was malfunctioning. They kept it for a month and called and said 'nope, it functions within our quality limits'...

So i bought a second super-auto hoping for a better machine. But, no... Just as watery and weak. So i did some research and found that super-autos will never produce quality like a semi. So...

I bought this machine. And i could not be happier. Its an upgrade from my previous semi in many ways.

The set up was easy. The manual explains everything very well. And its very easy to adjust each setting (grind, water flow, amount of coffee) to achieve the perfect shot.

I am using Pikes Place roast coffee beans which is a medium roasted coffee. I have my grind setting on 6 and grind amount at 3 o'clock. I raised the temperature of the shots +2 as well as programmed the shot amount to be about 3.5 ounces which when pulling a shot comes out to exactly 2 ounces."

4556,1.0,2021-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Let’s start with the good. This is my first espresso machine and I had no experience I find it very easy to use and I am very happy with the final product that it makes. It is a little bit difficult to clean, but is very use easily used on a daily basis. Now for the bad sorry but I have to add this. I bought this off of Woot. For the first several months I was very happy, although I did note that there was a lot of water commonly found in the overflow tray. Breeville Customer Service this is a normal operation. Once I was hooked it failed the first time. I came in to turn it on in the morning and the main power switch had no affect. Sadly , This hasnt just occurred once, but six times. Now I won’t pretend that it was convenient for me to package this thing and to do without it for approximately a month by the time they turn around on service, but I figure life has problems as long as they make it right. Braville is under the opinion that their product is no longer under warranty. And I would tend to agree with that if it wasn’t for the fact that the product has failed consistently at least once every six months that I’ve owned it. And again if it was multiple problems I would suspect that it was an oddity but, same problem every single time. Braville has fixed it under warranty five times but now they believe that I should carry of the expense to repair it. As their customer service line that coordinates the repairs on these machines when they are having problems is always backlogged and very busy very hard to get a hold of, I would say that I am owed something for every time that I have had to take the time to coordinate the return and repair of the machine and been without its service for that period of time . For that reason I would have to say that I am a dissatisfied with it and I would suggest that you would look to another manufacture and less you want to have to deal with a unreliable machine.
And, I have to only conclude by what is not being sad that Breeville Has a known problem with these units and that is the reason that they have failed to provide any conclusions or recommendations on all of their previous repair attempts
I was told that on the third repair attempt that I was actually provided a different unit although the symptoms of the failure seem to be exactly the same all six times"
4557,5.0,2018-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Hello, I thought I'd throw out a review for this espresso machine now that I have been living with it for 6 months with daily use.
My background- I am not a hardcore espresso drinker. I had a $30 Mr Coffee machine, then when that started acting up replaced it with a $150 Cuisinart that served well for about 6 years. I used pre-ground coffee with those machines. I'm not one for straight up espresso or plain lattes/cappuccinos. I like my drinks sweeter- mint mochas, caramel, white raspberry, etc. I did work at a coffee cart for a couple years in college, though I was the first employee, so my training may have been lacking.

I would say in general this is a great machine, assuming- 1. You have proper expectations, 2. The machine you get doesn't have a breakdown.

For expectations, here's what I believe to be reasonable for this machine-
-It will make a mess. If you're looking for a mess free experience, you may want to double or triple your spending and look at fully automated machines.
-You are not a hardcore espresso drinker who is looking for the perfect shot and the best components for the money. To get that, you should be looking at separate grinders and espresso machines most likely totaling more than this.
-You are looking for convenience, but something that still leaves some room for experimenting.
-You better be comfortable with having a 2 in 1 machine. If the grinder or the espresso machine goes kerplooey outside of warranty, you have half a machine left. You might look a little silly when friends come over. They'll be expecting something super fancy from you because of all the espresso machines on your counter...

For me this machine has worked great. I am the only coffee drinker in the house, so it is harder for me to justify spending money on high end separate components. For purchases like this, it is possible to use coupons, and I also like to redeem credit card points for gift cards. So when I purchased this machine, I only spent a couple hundred out of pocket for it (if it breaks after 18 months, I'll be sad, but I'll probably buy it again since I didn't `pay' full price for it). I do not have extensive experience with home grinders, so to me, the grinder on the 870 seems sufficient for its purpose. Not a top of the line grinder, but I'm not looking for `perfection', just what tastes good and works well for me. Depending on the beans, I usually have the grind setting somewhere between 4 and 2. Beans have gotten stuck on me twice in the grinder. Both times tapping the side of it freed them up instantly. However, I have to say going from using pre-ground coffee to having a grinder is a huge step up, and I can't imagine going back to pre-ground in the future.

One of the things that really appealed to me about this machine was the pressure gauge. It has worked perfectly for me, with the assumption that it is functioning properly. I've seen some people say they had issues with it not registering any pressure, but it's hard to know their circumstances- beans, grind, tamp, broken gauge, etc. By my third shot I had the pressure well within the ideal range. It is surprising how much adjusting the dosage or grind one step can throw off the pressure. When switching beans, I've had situations where the current settings yielded a little too low pressure. Then I increase the fineness of the grind, and suddenly the pressure is too high, or vice versa. So a lot of the times, to dial it in may require a combination of changing the grind setting, changing the dosage, and adjusting the tamping. However, I've never found it difficult to keep a consistently good shot.

I have not played with the temperature settings on the machine. I did however increase the amount of water for a double shot a bit to compensate for the amount the grounds soak in. I have only used the single wall filters, and to me it seemed easy enough to use them, there is no need to use the double walls.

As for the steaming wand, it also works well and has a metal ball joint, which hopefully means it will last. After 6 years of use, the steam wand just fell off the Cuisinart. I typically steam 20-26 oz of milk, it does take a few minutes. I have also steamed closer to 8-10 oz and heating that amount up was noticeably quick. (I made the mistake of making hot chocolate for my 2 year old when I make coffee, so now the first thing I am tasked with each morning is making hot chocolate...)

Here are some tips that may help-
People mention it makes a mess with coffee grounds overflowing the filter basket. That is to be expected. If you are using the minimal dose amount, there's a good chance you're not using enough grounds. The end of the tamper is silver metal. When tamping, the top of that silver should line up with the top of the filter. For me, that usually ends up being somewhere in the 1:00 position on the dosing dial (this will vary based on beans). There is also an included dosing trimmer, but the 2 times I tried it, it made more of a mess, so I do not use it. If you want to minimize the amount of grounds falling onto the counter, you can rest your index finger cross ways on the front exposed lip of the filter when the grinding process is halfway done. That will let the grounds pile up a little higher and/or fall off to the sides more to stay on the tray, which you can sweep down. After removing the portafilter, I gently push the grounds down into a pyramid shape with the tamper, starting with the most precarious looking side, eventually pushing them down enough that the grounds are lower than the top of the filter except for a small hump in the middle. Then I tap it a few times on the counter to settle them, and proceed to tamp.

The other common complaint I see is that when steaming milk, the first few seconds of the steam is watering down the milk. There is a work around for this. When you turn the steam off, there is supposed to be an 8 second wait before the machine purges, I think it's closer to 5 from my experience. So what I do is turn on the steam with an empty cup under the wand, or a rag, to catch the water. Leave it on for about 20 or 30 seconds until you have nice consistent steam coming out, slide the dial to off, put the wand into the cup of milk and turn the dial back to on, in less than 5 seconds. Once you get used to it after a few times, it's pretty easy. I've only had the machine purge on me twice while steaming. One time was when I turned it on, off, on, off, and on. After I turned it on the 3rd time, it still purged, so it may not work after more than one on-off-on cycle.

I usually run through an empty shot first once the machine is heated and before doing the espresso shot, to heat the components and put the hot water in my coffee cup. On occasion the filter basket will get stuck to the shower head, mostly when it's an empty shot, once in a while when there are coffee grounds in it. If that happens, I just put the portafilter back over the filter about half way up, then give it a little tug and it usually pops off easily.

If you're looking for dry pucks, the key to that is to steam the milk after getting the shot of espresso with the portafilter in place. The steaming process directs pressure to the filter basket, which will squeeze out more water from the grounds. In some cases, the puck is dry enough that it just falls out when I turn it over. Otherwise a tap on the side, then a tap on the face pops it out. I think tapping from 2 angles helps. I've never had a problem with the whole basket popping out. I have dumped grounds without steaming afterwards, and while they were noticeably wetter, when the puck dropped it stayed together as one formed piece instead of falling into pile of mush. That was better than I expected. (I did that last week, knocked over my travel mug while steaming milk, so I needed to do a second shot, now my 2 year old gives me a friendly reminder to not spill my coffee every morning).

For maintenance, I perform the clean cycle with a tablet every 2 months (I average using the machine once a day). The drip tray is a bit of a pain to deal with. It is 3 pieces. However, with the Cuisinart I had, I cleaned the drip tray daily. With the 870, I can go up to 9-10 days before it gets completely full. I usually clean it once a week, so it's more of a pain cleaning 3 pieces, but I do it less often.

I have been very happy with this machine with very few complaints (some issues have been self-inflicted, like forgetting to add water to the tank, it survived). I have to say from my experience, this machine is worth 5 stars. I have not had any issues with it, and have not had to contact Breville. The other thing I noticed on their website is that do they do have a fair amount of replacement/serviceable parts available. The obvious stuff like portafilters, filters, tray pieces, etc. as well as other items like a frothing tip, shower head, and outer burr assembly. The prices on most of the pieces are not outrageous, so that leaves me hope that a year or two down the road as components wear out, it should be possible to replace them yourself and keep the machine running.

Sorry this got long... Hopefully someone finds this information useful, and if you're looking for an easy to use machine that still gives you room to play around with, this is a good one to consider, I highly recommend it. And if you can't trust a random guy from the internet, who can you trust?

Hi, I just wanted to add an Addendum:
1/28/2015
I have now been using this machine for 14 months, once daily about 95% of the time, and officially out of warranty. I have no issues to report, as it still works as well as it did when new. The only issue I did run into was doing bulk drinks, 3 cappuccinos back to back to back. By the third shot, after doing espresso-steaming-espresso-steaming-espresso, the machine did lose pressure. I ended up turning it off and back on and redid the third shot without further incidence. Also, I stepped away one time with the steam wand in milk to finish heating it up, and ended up getting distracted and forgetting it. I came back over 10 minutes later with the machine silent and blinking. It appeared it shut itself off after X minutes of steaming for safety reasons, I assume. I had quite the mess and felt a little dumb, but cycled the machine off and on and started over to heat the milk appropriately this time. I change the charcoal filter once every 6 months (water is already filtered), do regular cleaning with the tablet every other month, ran vinegar water through the machine around 12 months, and emptied and cleaned the grinder once per the manual. I still recommend this machine.

6/25/2016
Hi, just thought I'd mention I am still using this daily, and have had no issues with it since my last update. Following periodic cleaning recommendations, and it's still working well.

1/20/2017
Thanks for the comments on my review. I hope it has been useful for folks. I will add I am still using it regularly, right now down to about 3 times a week (too many kids to get ready in the morning to make anything for myself). I've continued to have good luck with it, just needing to adjust the grinding settings on occasion when switching beans or seasonal changes that affect the house temp and humidity. I've continued with normal maintenance. It did seem the frothing wand was not expressing its usual amount of steam at one point, so I cleaned with it a small little pin, inserting it in the tip (I can't recall if one of those came with this machine or if it was from a previous one, I think one came with it tho, little metal stick in a black plastic thumb drive looking thingy). I decided that would be a good time to follow the maintenance to run a tank of vinegar water through again, then swapped in a new filter for the tank after. I have had no more issues with beans getting stuck in the grinder or any other issues. I hope my experience with the machine up to this point is the norm for most people, as it's been a pretty good machine for me.

12/3/2020
I thought I'd do a quick update, maybe I've been one of the lucky ones with this machine as I've seen other reviews with leaks and issues. But when this machine works, it's a dream. My 2 year old is now 9, and with 2 other siblings the quantity of hot chocolate made has increased significantly, as well as the usage of this machine overall. I've gone from using 3-4 times a week, to using it daily since about April. I did do a super thorough cleaning then, ran through some vinegar water and used a descaler too, which didn't get much out, just mostly clear water. So that's a good sign with the filtered water we've been using. I did replace the gasket for the shower screen. Not for any particular reason other than I came across one online here, and decided at this age, it might be good to start replacing items that could fail/crack. It was fairly straightforward, removing the screen and swapping out the ring. Went back together fine and had no issues. Other than that and dismantling the grinder to clean, that's about it.

One other thing I started doing, was doing a single dose for the grind. I still use a double filter, so I'll tamp after dose 1, then do another single dose (both on the lowest setting) and tamp again. Probably not the proper way to do it, but it makes less of a mess that way overfilling the filter. I also saw someone mention doing a single dose and turning the grind volume way up, to fill the double filter. I thought I tried it once, and it wasn't enough, but I may give that a try.
Even if/when it does fail on me at this point, it outlasted my previous machine and I would be hard pressed to think badly of it."
4558,5.0,2016-04-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have had the machine for 2 years now. It does take some time for the operator to learn the nuances of making the perfect cup of espresso.
Once you master the grind, the amount of coffee, the tamp pressure....it makes a far better cup than you can buy at Starbucks.
I have had zero mechanical issues after brewing over 1000 shots of espresso. My only complaint would be the steaming wand streams water before steam is generated so make sure that the wand is not in your milk when the steam spout first starts to deliver liquid."

4563,2.0,2016-01-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"THE GOOD
This is an excellent espresso machine. As a beginner, I was able to whip up pretty great espresso fairly quickly, and even got to experimenting with various beans and corresponding grinding settings. It is a great machine to learn how to make a good cup of coffee.

The steam wand works great as well, and with some practice, I was able to make good foam and average latte art.

THE OK
The machine is slow. Making cappuccino for two easily takes 5 minutes. The machine is pretty loud too, which means making the coffee will wake you up long before the coffee gets to your mouth.

THE UGLY
The machine is impossible to fully clean. The grinder hopper has layers of plastic you can never really get to. The actual espresso mesh is surrounded by a void which you can't clean. The drip tray goes in a shelf which has gaps on the upper side, which you can feel but never clean. Even the power cord goes in a gap and into a box which is empty.

The upshot is that this is a machine that produces moisture, and has ample space for it to collect and never be reachable.

Before we had this machine, we once had a roach issue. We got a spray, cleaned the whole kitchen, and the issue was gone. After we got this, we had a roach issue again, and this time the roaches had a mansion. No amount of spray can get them out of this machine. We eventually moved to a new house and this machine brought the bugs in like a Trojan horse.

Currently it is sitting outside in the sun, dehumidifying. The hopper that I washed three days ago still has water in it. I can still see roaches in the box the power cord goes in. I don't have the courage to bring this germ factory inside, so we are getting by on Keurig."

4565,1.0,2015-04-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Apparently the two year ownership hurdle is hard for this machine to reach without major problems. If you think spending $600 on a machine that lasts a short time is a good way to spend your money, go for it. If you like a good value for your hard earned cash, move along. Without going into a lot of details, Breville did send me a reconditioned machine after the warranty period had expired at no cost to me, but the replacement machine seems nothing close to new. I jumped through the ""cleaning"" hoops for them when I first contacted them about the faulty machine. It took hours and hours and did nothing to fix the machine. I figure I'll be lucky to get a whole two years combined with both machines."

Yeah... This machine is about 600 bucks. Pretty much the most indulgent thing I've ever purchased. But if you want good espresso, from a machine that lasts, this is actually a bargain compared to the legit machines which are in the thousands! I owned a 100 dollar DeLonghi EC155 as my first espresso machine, but the pump busted after a year of occasional use. And the espresso wasn't even espresso... More like concentrated coffee. If you are an espresso drinker and know good coffee (I.e. Not Starbucks lattes, Nespresso pod based beverages or worse, Keurig!) this machine is worth the money."
4569,5.0,2017-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is a wonderful all in one espresso machine. This replaced an older Nespresso. There are enough settings for the new “barista” to customize shot of espresso. I would definitely recommend this machine and would purchase again for myself or a gift.

4574,5.0,2014-10-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is my third espresso machine, and by far the best. The build quality is absolutely exceptional - honestly it looks and feels like a machine that cost four times the price. The built in grinder really simplifies the process, improves the coffee and reduced the mess. The pressure gauge is extremely helpful in determining the right grind and tamping pressure. The steamer works brilliantly too. Even little things like the built-in storage, the magnetic holder for the tamper and the indicator to show the drip tray is full is all so well thought out. So glad I bought this espresso maker!"
4575,5.0,2017-10-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After reading the reviews here I took a chance and bought the Breville BES870XL.
For the first few times I got the same bad results that many here have reported.
But after testing and adjusting the settings I now get ""perfect"" espressos, cappuccinos and lattes every time.
Using my supply of pre-grinded Bustelo made it hard to reach the espresso range in the pressure valve.
Then I grinded Community Coffee Pecan Praline and now I hit the mark every time.

I received Lavazza's crema whole beans and a milk thermometer and now it's ALL PERFECT.

For grinding the wheel is set to #7, and the amount just below (to the left) of the tick mark (on top).
Insert the coffee holder and click once for the right amount of coffee, press down to the right depth.
A double shot comes out perfect with a lot of coffee crema. The pressure level is best right in the middle of the range.
Frothing whole milk to 160 degrees F produces lots of fine crema you can cut with a spoon.

Everything works great, I recommend this item very highly !!!"
4576,5.0,2016-01-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine! For six months now, My wife and I have enjoyed perfect cappuccinos on a daily basis. This model does it all, including personal preference tweeks for grinding and extractions. Steamer works flawlessly. Learning curve is quick. Enjoy!"
4577,3.0,2016-04-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've had this machine for nearly 10 months and have used it probably 10 times per week on average.

Until recently, it has worked fine with 1 caveat: adjusting the size of the shot is really difficult. I've tried everything to get a 2 ounce shot, but they usually come out around 1.5 ounces instead. I've followed all the directions in the manual and have tried 10 different types of espresso beans, all with no luck.

Recently, it started leaking from somewhere inside the machine. When we pull a shot now, water drips from inside the machine down into the drainage reservoir. Being under 12 months old, I expect Breville will take care of it, but it's definitely a hassle. I would expect an expensive machine like this to be a lot more durable."
4578,1.0,2014-10-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I don't get any pressure on the gauge and i only get about a tablespoon of expresso now. It worked for a long time, then i had to not use it for 6 weeks, then when i plugged it in and it is broken. No changing of the amount of coffee or the type of grind helps.

I tried several times to get help from Breville, but none work. I think they are all on vacation there or something."
4579,5.0,2015-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Slight learning curve, makes a great product once you're finished."
4580,5.0,2018-10-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,I recently purchased this machine and followed the manual instructions to prime and clean the machine. Then started the grind level at 5 as suggested but found that even with adequate tapenade the pressure didn't rise and the coffee was under expressed... I slowly reduced the grind one notch at a time and found that at setting 2 of the grind was the perfect grind level for delicious espresso! May I recommend that the average person should use the single walled double dose filter basket and make a double espresso instead of a single shot?! I just found that the amount of delicious froth/foam and quantity of coffee in a single shot glass can be extracted in this way... All the best to everybody in your coffee endeavours!
4581,5.0,2015-12-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,I got this machine and after month i hate it couldn't make any foam or good espresso. In one occasion frend of mine come to my house (he is bartender) I said can you make any good coffee or i will sell it :-( Holy smoke :-) in 5 min calibration and playing with steamer:-) GREAT. It's really art of making coffee you can't just put coffee and push button . Long story short after 2 pounds of Starbucks coffee i make GREAT cappuccino and espresso and i mean GREAT... Lime my machine and of course end up paying for lunch to my friend and his wife :-) But it was worth:-))))
4582,5.0,2014-09-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is an absolutely beautiful and great product!!
4583,5.0,2017-01-25, Black Sesame,"I've used this machine for about 6 months now. It has worked great and is a big improvement from my older espresso machine. The only thing I'd like to comment on is that the machine seems to be very sensitive to the freshness of the beans. I couldn't get any pressure at first and after calling customer service and doing the pressure test with the plastic wrap, etc, I switched to a local roaster with fresh beans and it has made all the difference. I constantly get a good pull on every shot now and never worry about the pressure. My friend (who has the same machine) and I always joke that the gauge in the front should read ""Freshness"" instead of pressure to gauge the freshness of the beans. Like all machines, it does have a learning curve and will be different for everyone. After messing around, you can get excellent results."
4584,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I want to love this, I really do. It produces OK coffee for the price. It's easy to use. My first machine broke down soon after I bought it and tthe company shipped me a new one, no questions asked. I've had the new one for a year, and it has broken down again. What I find really irritating is that I have been calling the service center for three days w/o receiving a call back. I'm not crazy about the idea of replacing a $600 machine every year. As many people I have mentioned, the pros is that it is not as expensive as some of the really upscale machine, and the coffee it produces is pretty good, not great. It is easy to use. On the Con side, it makes an enormous mess, and in my case at least, it hasn't proved to be very consistent, always breaking down. I should also point out that when I had a problem with the grinder, the service center told me that I had to use beans that were no more than 2 weeks old (roasted within the last 2 weeks). Even here in NYC, a pretty cosmopolitan place, that's not always easy to find."
4585,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have wanted this machine for years, and was so excited when my husband surprised me with it. Thats where my excitement stops. I have spent the day playing with the settings, reading trouble shooting tips and watching videos on youtube. I've gone through $10 worth of espresso beans, trying to make just one single shot of drinkable espresso. These are the issues of encountered. My machine never got up to pressure. Despite grinding at the finest setting, and making sure the basket was fulland properly tamped, the water ran out of the port filter, making thin bitter coffee. I have tried every adjustment and all the filters, with the same result. The grinder dispenses way too much esspresso, even after adjusting it.(the photo shows the overage amount from two grinds.) The steam wand spurts water rather than steaming."
4586,5.0,2014-06-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I received this espresso machine on my birthday two years ago. It has been a wonderful machine since the day I got it. I am able to get beautiful crema on my espresso. The frother makes perfect micro-foam milk- IF you do it right. I was able to make latte art a few times! I was reading the 1-star reviews and I hope that doesn't deter people from purchasing this espresso machine. It's sad, I think they just got lemons. I love this espresso machine. It gets used at the minimum of three times a day. On Sundays when everyone is home it gets used at least seven times a day.

However if you are not experienced with making espresso and you want something that will make perfect espresso and milk without putting anything into it, then this probably wouldn't be the right espresso machine for you."
4587,5.0,2014-09-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,Excellent machine. Outstanding delivery. Little messy initially. Takes some 10 extractions to be familiarized with process and become expert. Highly recommended
4588,5.0,2022-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,WOW! What I'm makeing at home is better than what I had been paying $4-$5 for at various espresso bars around town and I live in Seattle; well known for its good coffee.
4589,5.0,2015-04-24, Black Sesame,"Wow, unbelievably good. It costs twice as much as my Delonghi EC680M DEDICA machine, but the taste is ten times better, and the set-up is very efficient and easy. Tastes like a high-end café's espresso. Well worth the extra cost."
4590,1.0,2016-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I Purchase this product in December 2018 and has a warranty for 1 year and of course it broke down after a year and 6 months. That is how things are build now. But I purchased the extra warranty that Amazon offers (AllState) $50+ bucks extra. Therefore I called ALL State insurance and basically you have to find the repair shop paid for it and then they will give you the money back. However in Florida I do not see anyone that works in these machines. I maintained the machine as instructed cleanings etc. But still one day all the steam was gone and was leaking water and the machine got really hot so I disconnected. Trying to find help to find a authorized repair Dealer for this machine in USA I Google Breville they are based in the Phillipines (Asia) & Australia and you can send the machine to them to get it repair. Imagine if you loose this $550 dollars of your hard earned money and if lucky this will take weeks before you see the machine again.

You call their service number in USA and 1-866- 273-8455 option 2 and then 1 and is 1 hour wait. Yes 1 hour wait. Then after 50 minutes a lady answer and then she asked for my name and last name and then they hang up. This is where I am now. I have this machine in my kitchen and does not work. I will try again to see what I am going to do and will give an update of this review. But my advice do not buy this machine is a headache and time consuming to get this to run/repair again. I do not know about you but I want everything as simple as possible in my life. specially after spending half a grand. Very Bad ....!"
4591,3.0,2020-11-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine 2 years ago and it has been awesome. Sadly the shut off mechanism stopped working recently. I called Breville to get troubleshooting and/or service. Turns out the machine needs to be sent in for service. The cost to repair was half of the price of a new one. I am not sure I would purchase another Breville product, after 2 years of use and 600$ it cost almost as much to repair as to replace. I would recommend looking for another machine. I mean it's great and all but for that money I expect it to run a little longer than 2 years. My cheap espresso machine was still kicking when I got this one and I had it for 7 years. Kinda sad actually."
4592,5.0,2020-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This was my first espresso machine. It takes some getting used too, I couldn’t live without it now! Well worth the money."
4593,5.0,2022-06-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really like this espresso machine. Had it for 5 months now and no issues at all. It looks amazing and extracts great shots after I spent some time adjusting different parameters. Two things that were improved from previous model are the bean hopper and the steam wand. The bean hopper is taller now and the beans don't get stuck anymore, especially since the beans I use are freshly roasted and a bit oily. The new steam wand is simpler now and is easier to clean. I prefer this over a fully automatic machine since you have a little more control over the fine tuning to create a perfect espresso shot.
I purchased mine from BB&B with the 20% off coupon. The price was $480 plus tax, can't beat the price for an espresso machine like this. I highly recommend Breville Barista Express BES870XL to anyone looking to buy a machine that works great, looks really good, and is not looking to spend a fortune on it."
4594,5.0,2019-05-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awesome machine and worth the value. Quality manufacturing nothing is cheaply made. Bought it for my parents and they love it. With this machine i seem to enjoy making the expresso more than actually drinking it (it tastes magnificent don't get me wrong). Something about making that perfect expresso...
4595,5.0,2019-07-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Had this machine for a week now and couldn't be happier. Took me about 6-7 tries to dial in the grind size / grind amount and get the proper tamping presure down but now i've nailed it and love it. Attempted a cafe mocha for the first time today for my wife, watched a few vids on youtube and I'd say first pass was almost spot on! But for me the trial and adjustments makes it all worth the while with a great sence of accomplishment when you get it just right, which didn't take long at all. Machine if heavy duty, single boiler is fine if your a casual am/pm drinker. Actually returned a 2200.00 double boiler fancy Izzo Alex unit for this after trying it at a friends place. Don't think you can get a better unit on the market for this price point given the performance it delievers. Love it! Enjoy."
4596,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you want to plug in an espresso machine, not read the directions and not take the time to dial it in... this is not the machine for you. If you want to take the time to learn this machine, I doubt you'll find a better, more professional, high-quality espresso machine with a grinder on the market. Things I learned:
1. Buy 3-4 pounds of cheap espresso beans at first. You will need them as you play around with the machine, adjusting grind and volume settings as well as your own tamping pressure.
2. Follow the instructions EXACTLY. I skipped warming the porta-filter with hot water for my first 20 shot pulls and couldn't get the pressure right.
3. Accept that the machine needs primed, almost. After 2-3 weeks of fiddling with adjustments and pulling espresso shots regularly, you will have a wonderful machine that requires little maintenance and makes better quality drinks than any coffee house."
4597,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Consistent good shots every time as long as you get the right amount of coffee packed in
4598,5.0,2015-11-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Paid for itself in six months. Owned it for over a year with zero issues.
4599,5.0,2020-11-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Fantastic machine for someone who enjoy espresso-based drinks. After three years of continuous usage, the machine still works as new. Of course, regular maintenance is critical to keep it running in good conditions. The only complaint is that the grinder tends to malfunction with oily, dark roast beans."
4600,5.0,2015-09-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband and I both worked for Starbucks before we got married and are coffee lovers. I use this machine several times a day and get great results every time!
4601,5.0,2017-09-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a great little machine. We roast our own beans and this can handle grinding any roast we throw at it. It produces consistently delicious and energizing espresso and the frothing wand works great too. The grinder did break after about a week of use on the first one we got, but Breville quickly provided us a replacement that has worked great ever since. Between Breville and Amazon the customer service leaves nothing to be desired."
4602,3.0,2014-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worked great for 16 months daily use then abruptly failed without warning.
Suspecting a valve or mechanism that diverts excess pressure to the drip tray is the culprit. When in brew mode, no pressure is sensed on the gauge and direct stream of water from the pump makes its way into the tray.

Not a good value for 16 months use. I have an older Capresso EC50 unit that continues to function and cost a fraction of the Breville Express.

Have an open case with Breville support and will update with the outcome.
Breville has great technical support. Above all standards."
4603,5.0,2015-01-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Breville built this right. HD machine sturdy enough to produce plenty of cups every day, no problem. Makes great espresso. Warms up quickly & easy to clean. Built in coffee grinder removes the hassle of measuring out grounds each time, making a cup very quick and easy. My lone negative comment would be I wish the bottom tray was stainless steel VS plastic. I'd have paid more for that."
4604,5.0,2014-11-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband got it for me as a gift. I absolutely love it! Very nice quality. Easy to use. I highly recommend this machine!
4605,5.0,2017-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,I visited my twin brother in February of this year and he had one of these machines and it made the best espresso and cappuccino's I have ever had for a home espresso machine. It was awesome!!!
4606,5.0,2014-12-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,love it！we use it everyday and it works great!
4607,5.0,2017-01-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is an awesome machine. Simple to use and makes an outstanding latte. We love ours.
4608,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased mine from Williams-Sonoma, and after 6 months the original unit started to make a weird noise during extraction. Called up Breville and described the issue to them and they sent me a brand new machine right away.

I googled this a bit and the issue that my first unit experienced doesn't seem to be a common issue with this model, so I suspect that my original unit was probably just a one off lemon.

I'm giving this machine 5 starts for the ease of use and for the fast and painless warranty return process that Breville has in place."
4609,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,Salam Elaikum How much electricity is the machine
4610,3.0,2017-10-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased my Breville BES870XL from a brick and mortar store. It looked and worked great, and I enjoyed my daily latte, sometimes two.

Conceptually, the Barista Express is a great machine; however, the quality of its components and workmanship leave much to be desired. I will say that It worked well while it lasted. Despite being well maintained, the machine only lasted 17 months. The machine first began to exhibit problems reaching pressure above the preinfusion range, and within a couple of days the pump died.

It's OK for an entry level machine, but in my opinion it is far too costly given the high failure rate of its components coupled with the the high cost of repairs, which usually cannot be done locally. So, I've replaced the Barista Express with an Italian made machine that is far more expensive, but also far more reliable. The difference in quality and performance is like night and day."
4611,5.0,2017-09-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had the previous model of this machine for 3 years now. I've used this machine in a small office environment (4 or 5 cups per day). It has not had any issues, and it's made excellent espresso every time (assuming the use good beans). I strongly recommend this machine. As long as you keep it clean, keep using the tablets whenever it tells you to, and use vinegar or some cleaner to remove calcium buildup, this machine will last a while."
4612,5.0,2019-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love our machine. Make sure you spend a bit of time when you're first setting it up to configure the grind and amount of beans, that's the real trick. The pressure gauge makes getting a GOOD espresso shot easy, even when half asleep in the morning. Since we've gotten this, we have yet to be back at Starbucks."
4613,5.0,2017-03-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this thing.
4614,1.0,2014-01-28, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is not as fool proof as a fully automatic, but if you are OK with nuances a semi-automatic (making adjustments to get the right pressure) the end product is quite good. I like the milk frothier and the grinder work well (when the grinder is functional). The low rating is based on a grinder failure after a few months at around 50 uses combined with the complete lack of a customer service response for several weeks via the web form. Tired also calling, but the hold time was too long. I decided to call again today at 4:32pm PST to a voice message that the customer service office closed at 4:30pm PST. The website says the customer service line is open until 5pm. I am sure if I called at 2:18pm the message would say they closed at 2pm or I would be placed on hold until they actually did close. Or may the website update went the same place as my original support ticket. The sad part about it is machine makes good coffee and my Breville toaster has been solid. May update to 3 stars if they respond to my service request and 4 stars if they actually repair it.

Update 11/12/2018 -- Was able to request a return form online. Took about 3 1/2 weeks to get the machine repaired (6 business days to ship packing materials, 5 business days to repair and 6 business days to ship back). They did fix the grinder, but there was a thick film a ground expresso blocking grinder preventing grinds from exiting. Had to clean the machine that had just been serviced. Once cleaned the grinder functioned well, but the machine is unable to register enough pressure to make anything but a sour espresso. To add insult to the situation I called in today to ship the machine back only to find that the call center is in training. I have called three times during there restrictive hours and no one has answered. I am beginning to wonder if this call center actually exists."
4615,5.0,2018-06-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I researched a variety of machines before I took the plunge. This machine is fabulous! It does take a little experimenting to get your desired perfection. After 2 years we are still extremely satisfied. We had an issue after about 6 months but Breville's customer service is top notch! We recently purchased a second machine for our beach getaway. I would not hesitate to recommend this machine to anyone. You will not be disappointed. It will transform your daily coffee/espresso experience.
4616,5.0,2014-11-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Absolutely a fantastic espresso machine. I have had this for 1 1/2 trouble free years. The quality is fantastic. It take a little time to learn how to setup the grind and pressure but once you figure it out, you only need to make small changes when you switch beans. Very happy with the quality."
4617,5.0,2013-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing machine. Still learning proper tamping pressure on the grounds
4618,5.0,2019-12-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best. buy. ever.
4619,5.0,2015-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love coffee, and this is an amazing espresso machine, since I bought it I feel so happy, and my coffee is amazing, is fresh, taste better, and is easy to use. I don't need a barista; I can make it by myself during I make my breakfast . One good thing about this machine is that we can buy some accesories like filters, cleaning tablets, steel frosting, pitcher, etc. That make more easy to use and also more fun."
4620,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I loved this machine for the almost three years. The solenoid valabe went just after year one. Spent ~$300+ to fix with Breville. Solenoid went in year two. Bought a replacement part and decided to take a chance and open it up and fix it. Worked great. Now nearing year three,something else has gone wrong and it won’t maintain any pressure. Really disappointed in the longevity of this machine given the price. Time to go."
4621,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I don't normally feel compelled to write reviews, but I love this little machine. It makes some of the best tasting espresso I've ever had, and the process couldn't be simpler or more convenient. It is very well built, ingeniously designed, and easy to use. Keep everything clean and it should provide years of great tasting espresso and cappuccino. Yes, you could buy more expensive machines, and for the purist the integrated grinder raises eyebrows, but the grind is very consistent and for someone who just wants a great espresso with the least hassle, this is a great choice. And for the kids, try using the frothing wand with chocolate milk- sacrilege I know, but the smiles on their faces will make your day!"
4622,1.0,2017-08-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My experience with this machine and Breville is not due to a one in a hundred chance lemon. This is a flawed machine. The machine on the outside is beautiful and well made of stainless steel. Very attractive and great concept. And when it works, it works well. The problem is it does not work for long. Maybe a year with light use. I cleaned and maintained it very well. I take great care of my things, especially considering the cost. At over $500, this machine should last years. Don't count on it. Within 8 months, it started a very loud rattling and eventually would no longer build enough pressure to draw a shot. Called Breville, and like a program themselves, they asked if, how and how often I cleaned it. They never asked my frequency of use. I detailed the extent of my cleaning, but they still insisted I perform five cleaning cycles. I found this insulting as they still thought it was a cleaning issue. I have had many machines before and understand how to keep it in optimum condition. The cleaning did not work, and they reluctantly sent me a new machine. Well, that machine just went up in smoke only 15 months later. The wiring fried with smoke out the back. Called them and no-can-do. No longer in warranty. She suggested it had to be something I did. BUT, for $230 dollars, I can send it to them to have it fixed and they'll give me another. If I want, I can add another $230 dollars to the cost for the second replacement that never made it much past a year. I checked the internet and many have reported the same rattling noise that plagued the first machine. In summary, this is nice on the outside, but defective on the inside. They will blame it on lack of cleaning. The very first question they ask. They do not stand behind their product past the first year. And, you will be the reason for failure due to your lack of proper care. Even though some review sites indicate it as a good machine, don't buy it. Other reviews may sound great, which out-of-the-box, it probably was... but it won't last. If you pay this much, it should last more than a year. After two machines and less than two years, it isn't worth it. Choose another manufacturer. It isn't a question of if, but when."
4623,5.0,2017-01-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Breville I LOVE YOU! You are just perfect for us!
4624,3.0,2017-02-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"While I still think this is the best option for the price, and it can produce great results, there are drawbacks to consider. It's great when it works applies hear. I found that it may not be possible to purchase parts including basic items such as replacement bean hoppers and grinder burs. While i can still purchase parts for my ancient refrigerator and 10 year old air compressor. Other reviews indicate that customer service is poor, which is particularly troubling since they promote themselves as a premium brand. Additionally, we have found that the grinder may not process lighter roasts. We have encountered jamming issues with coffee roasted to between the 1st and 2nd crack, but only with one variety of beans. If/when this unit breaks and can't be repaired we will probably go with more expensive discreet components from companies with better customer service."
4625,5.0,2015-09-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I've read most of the reviews (good and not-so-good) regarding the 870XL and don't understand why people are having difficulty getting the correct extraction. I've had the machine for about 36 hours, have read the manual and have gotten consistent extractions with just a few trials. I think the machine it intuitive and easy to use. Given it's price point, I'm expecting many years of trouble free service."
4626,5.0,2016-04-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,I watched the video on using the Breville Express once I unpacked it. Within a couple of try's I felt like a professional Barista.
4627,5.0,2021-06-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The most amazing espresso machine I've owned in this price range. Breville really knocked it out of the park on this one. For budgets that don't consist in the thousands, this is the machine for you. The espresso made is delightful, the steamer works with perfection and their pressure system is spot on. I am an Industrial Designer and the R&D that must have gone into this machine shows through a flawless user experience. **Insert golf-clap here**
Bravo Breville. Bravo."
4628,5.0,2017-07-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Amazing!!

4630,5.0,2021-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,Its an awesome machine .
4631,5.0,2016-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso maker is the best! Easy to use, easy to clean, and makes the best espresso!"
4632,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We have been using this espresso machine for about 3 years now, usually 2-3 drinks per day and have never had an issue with any part of the machine. We follow the cleaning and care instructions, and really enjoy the delicious espresso the Barista Express produces. Well worth the price tag for anyone that is serious about making espresso drinks at home. It has certainly paid for itself by keeping my wife from visiting Starbuck's as often!

Can't go wrong with this product."
4633,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The Breville BES870XL is an excellent machine. We have had this unit for almost 1 year and use it daily. It does take some experimenting to get the perfect latte, as you need to get the grind size, amount, and steamed milk just right....but it is well worth it! I'd recommend getting a slightly larger milk picture if you plan to make a 16oz or larger latte, the one it comes with is just slightly too small for anything over a 15oz latte. As others have mentioned filling the water is a bit tricky if you place the unit under a wall cabinet, but still doable. I would definitely purchase this machine again or recommend it to a friend, it is well worth the money."
4634,3.0,2022-05-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really love this espresso machine, when everything is working, it is top notch.
Unfortunately, the grinder on top stopped working, and the cost to repair this, is over half as replacing the whole machine, so wish there was a better way to gets serviced, as it probably doesn't make sense, but maybe that is their objective, to just have us buy another espresso machine.

Machine is still working great after 4 years.
Grinder stopped working after about 2-2.5 years roughly"
4635,3.0,2021-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am on my second 8970XL. When they work they do work rather well. But, two complaints:
1. The steamer is slow to heat and require a cup to collect all of the hot water it delivers before steaming starts. Then it takes a while for the steam to ""dry out"" for frothing. It's an inconvenience, and many others I knwo that use this machine use a battery whipper to make a foam because the Breville frother is a pain.
2. My first Breville Barista was an 860XL. Worked well enough until the pump failed 55 days after the warranty expired. They replaced it with a refurbished 870XL and charged me $225. That was 15 months ago. Now the 870's pump is about to die.
I'm considering a Rancilio or other, more expensive, machine based on user reviews and good reports of durability."
4636,5.0,2021-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine at B&B and after trying all kinds of cheap and second hand espresso machines, I finally can make a quick organic coffee soy-latte every morning at home really easy!

It is worth to invest some spare money for this machine if you a coffee lover. The coffee grinder is maybe not the best, but it makes the whole operation of preparing fresh coffee a snap so I think that it is a good idea to spend the additional $100 to have the grinder and the fully automatic espresso machine."
4637,3.0,2017-06-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I won't elaborate on its ability to make a good espresso, it works and it's great. However it is a wasteful machine in the sense that on its lowest grinding volume it runs far too long where I have to dump about a soupspoon of grinds Speaking with customer service was useless, but it appears to be a design flaw not a defect.
My workaround is to run the single shot grinder with the dial turned up but that is not going to be intuitive if some family member or anyone else attempts to make coffee on their own
So if you like to dump beans, get it"
4638,3.0,2017-07-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A great entry level espresso maker allowing you enough manual decision to feel like you are a real barista. Have had great pleasures out of the BES870XL, but unfortunately, it does not have a very long lifespan. We had ours for just over 1.5 years and it has died in the pump/pressure system. No repair without a receipt so hold on to that."
4639,3.0,2016-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve had mine for 5 years, and after a while the pressure doesn’t even register on the gauge. It was nice while it lasted and I got my money’s worth but don’t expect it to last a lifetime."

4641,1.0,2017-03-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife bought the original for my birthday several years ago along with a Breville blender. It worked OK for about a year than died. She bought this from another company along with a 5 year warranty. Returned for repair...was replaced with a new one...which lasted about another year. Same story and again one year life span. The store offered to give a full trade in on another brand....a simpler Krups that ddn't grind the beans but beside espresso it also can make a pot of coffee. The Krups is going strong after over 5 years of daily home use (two cappuccinos a day at minimum) plus pots of coffee during day.
When the Breville was working it was mostly OK but not consistent. Cleaning was a bit of a extended process....when you look at this it looks like it will be a easy one stop machine but that isn't so. I also found the frother just OK. I decided to try a device that heats and spins the milk to make the froth. It works so well and fast that I just use that instead of the steam frother....can't tell the difference in texture or taste...and less chance of scalding the milk. So with the Krups I just grind my own beans each day, use the extermal frother and get a perfect cup everything. The Krups also makes a really nice cremma....as nice as the Breville.
By the way...that Breville Blender is still working fine although the bearing in the blenders container died and had to replace with an entire new container as they don't have replacement parts. Not much support for their products ;-(
So as nice as the Breville looks it is only skin deep. I really wanted to love it but sadly we parted our ways. For the cost it just doesn't deliver"
4642,5.0,2017-03-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I absolutely love this espresso machine. I've been using it daily for over 6 months. It grinds the right amount at the right grind setting, it dispenses the right amount at the right pressure. There is no second guessing if your shots are going to be good. It's quick to heat up. The only downside is that it doesn't use a standard 58 mm portafilter. I'd love to be able to use a naked portafilter on this baby.

I love this thing. You won't be sorry."
4643,2.0,2017-03-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have owned this machine for 5 years and I have loved it. It started to leak from underneath and would not produce espresso. Called Breville customer service and they offered to repair it or send me another refurbished machine for $250:00 they said turn around time was 5 to 7 days after they received machine. They have had mine for 22 days and after 6 calls to them where I had to wait for an hour or more each time, I have no machine and they will not refund the $250 and claim they can’t return my machine that has a perfectly good expensive burr grinder on it.
Yesterday one of their reps on phone said he would send me a new machine. ( I couldn’t believe it but he said he would get it done). He never called me back and today they claim he left no notes and was not there. Finally after a very passive aggressive rep brushed me off, I researched and found the corporate phone in L A nothing !
I had to put a dispute charge on my credit card and it will take 90 to resolve so I am out $250. Maybe I will get it back. Don’t count on them for anything."
4644,3.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've now had two of these and they both worked well for the first 18-24 months, then they started making a loud noise when brewing and the pressure no longer worked. In other words, it's a great machine for 1-2 years then you start having issues! The repair for the issue is $239 from Breville, almost half the cost of the machine. I'm trying to decide what to do."
4645,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am a big espresso enthusiast that have been studying the art of preparing coffee for the last decade or so. I also own a Rancilio Silvia (bought in November, 2013) and have owned previous Breville models. The barista is an outstanding machine. The grinder provides the right particle distribution to extract an amazing espresso. The machine has a temperature PID controller that is a big plus over the Rancilio. The Barista is easier to operate than the Rancilio Silvia, but both provide excellent espressos."
4646,1.0,2014-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,Absolutely NO customer service. Impossible. No call backs. No email responses. Hours long hold times. There are hundreds of other brands to buy. Don't get yourself into the Breville products.

4648,1.0,2017-02-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is always a good reason when something is cheaper than its rivals. $600 for a combo grinder and espresso machine that has a built-in PID is definitely a steal. BUT you are really paying much more for its horrible durability, especially, combined with lack of responsibility from Breville. Initially, the grinder gave me a good range of fine coffee for my espresso and the espresso machine brewed perfect shots of espresso. In less than 6 months the grinder started to slip and the grind size became significantly course despite regular cleaning and maintenance. I followed instructions of the manual and the technician on the phone to clean the whole burr groups; however, I still do not get a fine grind unless I set it at the finest and even then it is not always consistent. The espresso machine still works fine. I called Breville again and they mentioned that my grinder needs to be serviced but they voided my warranty since I had not purchased the machine from their “AUTHORIZED RETAILER”. Basically, they are not taking responsibility for a machine that malfunctions only after less than 6 months. I already spent enough for my espresso equipment for now so I need to wait longer for an upgrade which is certainly NOT a Breville. My next purchase is definitely going to be from a company with a better durability and responsibility "
4649,2.0,2017-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"UPDATE: (lowered my review to 2 stars). We bought our machine in June and loved it. Then the compression during brewing stopped working. It hasn't made a quality espresso in weeks. I called the customer service number today to see about getting it fixed. I've been on hold for 30 minutes now and still haven't spoken to a human being. The lack of customer service availability alone makes me regret having bought this, led alone the fact that it only worked for a few weeks before things went south.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: We'd been looking to get an espresso machine for a while, and this came with great reviews. We bought it a few weeks ago and it sat on the counter, none of us courageous enough to try it out. After a little reading through the instructions, we went for it. It made a great latte, and it was way easier than it looked. We're now doing white chocolate mochas, americanos, iced lattes and everything. Just today we had an issue where the ground espresso wasn't coming out of the grinder. A quick look in the instructions told us how to clean out the grinder, and we're back in business. I'm hoping this machine will save us the $60/month we've been spending at the local espresso shops. So far, so good."
4650,5.0,2015-06-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this model for about two and a half months so far and I'm happy with it. I've used it daily since I got it many times twice daily. I am not a connoisseur of espresso, but I do find it produces espresso to my liking consistently with the use of pretty much any good espresso beans. It may not be commercial quality, but you're not paying commercial price.
The cons are that it's messy and fairly noisy, but it's quick so the noise doesn't bother me much and I just deal with the mess to have the readily available espresso.
Edit: 5 years later it's still working and I'm still using it."
4651,1.0,2021-01-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is great until it stopped working (pressure loss) over a month ago. I contacted customer service and they said it was likely a gasket problem and agreed to send me a gasket when it was available. The gasket is a $4 part, but it was out of stock and would continue to be out of stock for a few weeks. (The gaskets for sale on Amazon are not OEM, 5x the price, and it is not clear if they fit this machine.) I checked back on their website and the gasket was back in stock; did they send me one? Nope. Called customer service again. They said that they ""forgot"" to send it. When I requested that they expedite the part, noting how long it has been, they refused. I still have not received any communication about when and whether this part is being sent. I expect better customer service from Breville for a $700 machine that is designed for daily use."
4652,1.0,2015-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The De'Longhi ECAM35020B Dinamica Automatic Coffee & Espresso Machine is MY CHOICE AS BEST HIGH END Espresso Machine! Not this or any of the Breville models/units.

I tried several including this machine, which is very expensive and takes up a huge chunk of counter space. I'm a professional chef so I may demand more out of a high end espresso machine than some of the casual 1 single shot latte' consumers out there. This machine only worked well enough to pour a good double shot if you only use the grinder that's built into the machine. Try using ground espresso beans from SBUX and forget it, the water flow from the machines pump is not strong enough to penetrate a weak tamp in the portafilter!
You may ask why use ground espresso if you have a grinder built into this machine. Well, what happens if the grinder breaks down or doesn't work right? You have zero options. Other than a run 🏃 to your local SBUX. I've read several reviews by users that had units with failing grinder, so this is a big deal. Not to mention downtime getting grinder or machine replaced.
Aside from this, I give this very pricey machine a 1-star for it's ""overall"" espresso quality (including store-bought ground espresso) ; bulkiness; counterspace usage; appearance. It's a monster on counter space usage! A machine should not have to use this much space to get a good quality espresso pour! The one good mark I give this machine is the frothing quality of the steam wand. It's a great frothed, but a huge frothed because that's it's best feature in my opinion."
4653,5.0,2016-10-31, Black Sesame,"This was my first expresso maker, and I couldn't have chosen a better machine. The built in burr grinder is the best part.

4654,1.0,2017-06-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine worked great initially. After about a year we started having problems. The grinder wouldn't shut off so we had to monitor it and stop it manually. Same thing happened with the cup size buttons. Frustrating, but something we could live with. Then this morning, the grinder stopped completely. A call to customer service gave me one option to try to reset the grinder, but it didn't work. No more espressos for me. I would not recommend this machine."
4655,2.0,2016-05-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Updated to 2* on 10/7/2018

Water pressure doesn't build up anymore, after 3 years of daily usage. I performed regular maintenance (backflush, descale, water filter, etc.) and took good care of the machine.

Looks like a lot of people have issues around 1 year in, so I suppose I did pretty well. But I still expect a $600 machine to last longer.

Original Review:

Makes a nice espresso, after the learning curve. After a few wasted bags of coffee, I've finally gotten to the point where the needle points dead center in the ""Espresso Range""!

My main issue with this machine is that there is a rather large clean-up effort for a single-serve machine. The grinds and coffee and water get everywhere, requiring me to rinse the whole thing every time I use it, even for a single shot of espresso in the morning.

The coffee grind is also not aligned perfectly with the portafilter if you are using the automatic grind amount. It spills a bit forward in the portafilter , getting onto the front edge. It lines up perfectly if you are using the manual grind amount, because you hold the portafilter in manually, slightly more forward.

My recommendation for first-time users:
1) Make sure you have the filter in the portafilter. I've forgotten to put it in, and the thing just explodes coffee all over your kitchen when you start to brew!
2) Experiment with the grind setting, but start at 4.
3) Have the grind amount knob at 1'oclock (one click right from facing straight up).
4) Don't tamp TOO hard.
5) Experiment with and change the grind amount, grind setting, and tamping strength. Be consistent, and adjust the machine to fit YOU. You and your spouse/friend/partner may have different settings, and that's OK."

4657,2.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"i got this unit from homecoffeesolutions.com lately and found the filter basket always stocked inside the machine and hard to get it out. Then i contact the manufacturer and below is what they replied.

Thank you for your email!
Are you referring to the filter basket that pops out of the portafilter?
It’s a known issue with the machine and we’ve found that replacement parts also cause this issue
We don’t have replacement filter baskets unfortunately
I hope this helps!

update on 12/26/19
Continue to communicate with vendor about how to resolve my issue, here is what they replied.

Based on my interactions with other Barista Express users, here’s what they did:
- Most of them that have this issue just deal with it, since there isn’t a viable alternative (one could upgrade their machine, but it would be very expensive)
- A smaller percentage of customers contacted Breville Support and they had some success with troubleshooting over the phone – it might be worth doing this
- A very small percentage eventually opted to move to a higher-end machine (however, in terms of bang-for-buck, there’s isn’t a higher value machine than the Barista Express)"

4660,1.0,2019-08-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So I ordered this for our office after extensive research and reading of customer reviews. I'm pretty up to speed already on espresso making and frothing. The machine looks beautiful with nice brushed stainless steel and heavy portafilter. Grinder and espresso worked well. However, from the beginning I had problems frothing. At first I thought it was me, and that I hadn't gotten the hang of the machine yet, so I decided to keep playing with it for about a week to make sure. Sometimes, I would turn on the steam wand to purge it, wait for the steam to come out and flashing light to stop, indicating that the machine was ready to froth. Then I would turn off the knob, quickly bring the pitcher to the wand (in under 7 seconds per the manual) and turn it back on. The boiler would stop working, and I would only get a short spurt of leftover steam that would last not long enough to froth. This wouldn't happen always, other times the wand would work great, and I would get a lot of microfoam. Then, there were times where the steam wand would produce a really loud boiling noise, and I would not get much froth. Upon removing the wand one time, when it was especially loud like this, I noticed it was shooting out spurts of hot water mingled with steam. At this point, I continued testing the wand without milk, and effectively, from time to time, it would just start shooting out spurts of water. Other times, it would steam properly. Yet, other times, I would turn on the frothing knob and the steam wand light that indicates water is heating wouldn't even turn on. I would have to turn the knob on and off again to get it to come on.

The grinder worked great. I used non-oily, high quality beans from Klatch coffee, and started the setting at 5 per the manual and actually got over-extraction. Never had an issue with beans getting stuck. I like how everything you need is included. There are a lot of features I like, but this machine comes across as delicate aka not durable. Plus, it's made in China. We mostly make lattes here at my workplace, so if the steam wand isn't working properly, that's a big deal for us. Plus at $600 I expect a sturdy, reliable, heavy duty item. Quality control needs to be on point. Nobody wants to spend $600 and then have to return something.

We returned this machine, but might buy another one to replace it. However, I'm not quite sure yet if $600 is worth an investment because a lot of reviews state that the lifespan of this machine is short. So I'm undecided."
4661,1.0,2020-01-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"At first the machine seems great but after 2.5 years of average use, it stopped working. No repair place will touch a Breville machine and Breville’s customer service is non existent.
I would never buy a Breville product again."

4663,2.0,2013-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The grinder lasted less than a year. Breville isn't replacing or making right. Other reviews state that the solenoid dies quickly. We'll see on mine. I'm very disappointed and dissatisfied. Breville has been blacklisted in my family, all of their products. A burr grinder should last more than half a year, when cleaned per directions. There is no excuse.

The machine pulls ok shots. Annoyingly inconsistent, but ok, I guess. I wasn't expecting a coffeeshop machine, but I was expecting more than a $100 Mr. Coffee.

My recommendation is to buy a cheaper machine, getting a good burr grinder that can grind for espresso, a naked portafilter, a non-pressurized filter basket, and avoid all Breville products. It'll cost you a lot less, you'll get a much better grinder, and more consistent espressos. Learn from my mistakes."
4664,5.0,2017-08-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Yes, that's right.

The ability to make your own cappuccinos, espressos or other fancy coffee drinks on demand in your own home?

It doesn't beat sex, but it comes close.

The grinder is exquisite at its job and has free'd up counter space for us. The pressure gauge is very useful for when I starting out.

We don't use the wand as we use the Breville automated frother, which we highly recommend as well in our household.

5 Stars all the way for Breville with this beauty!"
4665,3.0,2015-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I loved this machine for the first 6 months then I made the mistake of ""cleaning"" it even though there was nothing wrong. I ran white vinegar and water through according to Breville's own instructions. Now it makes a horrible screeching sound when the pump first starts. It still works but I can't stand the noise! My retailer graciously offered a free exchange (the one with the 20% off coupons). oh, which reminds me, 20% makes this a great machine as long as you don't get screech of death!

Oh, and my water is not terribly hard - I was just being pro-active."
4666,2.0,2016-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Purchased this over the thousands of positive reviews, wanting to be able to enjoy some well made coffee at home. I am not slow, I love tinkering with things, read manuals, watch videos, etc. Getting this machine to make consistent shots of coffee has been frustrating in the extreme. The grinder adjustments are all over the place. Setting 1 makes a powder so fine, it can barely brew. Setting 5 makes it so coarse it flows like water and never achieves pressure, making the other 11 settings pointless. And it is inconsistent. Sometimes it makes a decent grind, most times it does not.

The rest of the machine works OK, but frankly, you are going to have to spend another 200 bucks on a decent grinder as the one built in is garbage and just wastes coffee. I've gone through 3 pounds of fresh, locally roasted beans that work fine with my manual grinder trying to get it adjusted correctly.

I know my rating seems low, but the grinder is so important to a good cup that the machine is just bad as it stands now."

4669,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I got this machine as a birthday present less than 2 years ago. Worked perfectly, nice espressos, capuccinos and latte., 3 cups a day on average.I bought the barista decalcifying pills, followed maintenance as the intructions said. Then it broke down after roughly 18 months of use. It made horrible noises (rang loud noise) and coffee pressure was down. Contacted customer service, after some iterations and after unsuccesfully trying to run some cleaning routines they can only repair it in their Headquarters in California. I live on the east cost and sending the machine and having it repaired or replaced with arefurbished one (with 6 months) has a flat fee of 230 USD. Breville does not have and established network for technical service in the US. Your are responsible for packing the machine correctly, if it gets damaged on transit, Breville is not liable.

So I decided to end the hassle, bought a nespresso as replacement. Honestly, coffee for me is not the same, I am not really fond of capsules. But the value at risk of the machine is less. In the meantime I will look for a true espresso machine with authorized technical service in the east coast. So buy the machine if you live in California, get an extended warranty, and if not, keep all the packaging materials to be ready when fixing (and shipping) time arrives."

4671,1.0,2017-03-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine quit working after 2 years. I asked the rep how long it should last and was told it was a “lifelong product”...that would cost $300 to repair. There are two major issues that I have with Breville:

1. Logging on here, I see that many others have the same issue that I have with the machine: the loud, failing pump/pressure. Others have also called and received similar repair quotes; clearly, Breville is aware of this issue with their “lifelong product” and yet has not addressed it in the design or construction of the machine.

2. The cost to repair is half the cost of a new unit. So it’s probably safer to get a new unit with a one-year warranty than pay for the repairs and risk it breaking again.

I won’t recommend Breville products until they address their quality issues"
4672,2.0,2017-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I used to really like this machine. It does take some time to get all of the settings dialed in for whatever beam you’re using, but then it’s mostly fine. I like the integrated grinder, programmability for shot volume, and although it’s a very simplistic steam wand, it works well enough.

Here’s the thing. The machine just isn’t up to much use. I’ve hardly used this compared to what I’d assume it’s rated for. Maybe two or three times a week for a double shot of espresso. If I want two double shots, too bad because it needs about an hour to be able to pull a shot again.

Recently, from what I’ve been able to find out from searches, the solenoid valve has started to die. Tried to find a replacement part, but they’re all backordered from suppliers because the manufactured doesn’t have any.

While pulling a shot today the pressure built up, dropped off, then built up again before blowing the portafilter off of the machine. Hot water and coffee sludge sprayed all over the counter, but luckily I didn’t get burned by anything.

For the cost of this machine, I’m disappointed. If this is the quality that Breville is producing, count me out."

4674,1.0,2015-10-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Pros: A simple to use entry level expresso machine and very forgiving using the pressurized portafilter basket.
Cons: The grinder power engagement switch failed at the 6 month mark with an average use of six shots a day. FedEx picked it up yesterday to return it to the manufacturer as its within the one year warranty. For an appliance at this price point that should not happen. Furthermore, I would recommend buying a version without the built in grinder as it means one less thing to fail. We’re hoping the repair turnaround is quick and a positive experience but it really is a major annoyance having to even go down that path with no feedback from customer service on how long we will be without our espresso machine. Not happy going back to drip coffee while we play the waiting game. I’m glad we purchased the 4 year extended warranty if this 6 month failure is indicative of poor manufacturing and future problems.

Update 2/5/19: received our espresso machine back today. Downgraded the review to one star as we sent our failed unit in spotless condition in the original appliance box, original packing material, and inside the original shipping box. It was returned to us without the original appliance box in a plain cardboard box with foam packing. It was filthy and dripping water. Not happy with this turn of events. Needless to say my wife is on the phone again with their customer service."
4675,1.0,2016-08-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"As zero stars isn't an option- I'm forced to give 1 star.

I purchased the Breville in 2014 for home use- 2 espresso drinkers in the household. Good machine while it lasted. I started to have problems with it in mid-2015. The pressure/extraction wouldn't get into espresso range and then the machine would hum and click but nothing more. I was then able to 'trick' it into proper extraction using manual mode. That bought me some time while I called Breville to inquire as to what they could do.

I received and email that suggested a pressure test- which I conducted with obvious results. The machine was faulty. I again contacted Breville by phone and talked to Monica. Without asking any follow up information - she told me that it would be $240 dollars for them to service the machine; nearly half the price of a new unit. I asked her if that was the only option. She then offered to sell me a new unit for $500 - which she claimed was a great deal as I was already a Breville customer. That's true- but I am an unhappy Breville customer. There is a difference in that distinction.

I politely asked for any other solutions to this problem and she flatly stated, ""There isn't any. You can half us service the unit for $240, or you can buy a new unit for $500."" I then asked about local, authorized service centers. She informed me that there are no longer any local locations and that Breville now only has one repair location in the entire country (Illinois I believe is what she said). She then asked which route I'd like to go - repair or a new unit. Horrible.

For the $500+ I paid when brand new I expected far better product life and much better customer service. I recognize that espresso machines - due to the boilers and pressure required - will not last forever. I roast coffee for a small roaster so I'm familiar with the industry, machine operation and only ever fed my unit the freshest of beans. There is no excuse for such shoddy quality and short lifespan.
I can't emphasize enough how disappointed I am in Breville... Their product- and terrible customer service.

I recommend any considering this unit to look elsewhere. Find a De Longhi, Gaggia or Ascaso in your price range and go with it. Avoid Breville at nearly any cost."
4676,1.0,2015-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Played with all the settings and watched many video tutorials over the course of months, but I was only able to get good espresso after using another company's grinder and then transferring it to the basket. After 30 minutes on the phone with customer support (and after waiting 4 hours for a call back), they decided to do nothing to help an obviously faulty grinder. The internal setting is on the finest with the outer setting on the finest (I've tried many other combinations), and yet the coffee is still course and won't produce enough pressure. Their solution? ""Use the double walled basket"". HAH! That thing produces pressure without coffee in it, it's training wheels, so obviously that will move that gauge. Doesn't matter that I told them I can use another company's grinder for finer coffee which then produces the right pressure - they still say it's a me problem because he ""heard the grinder work perfectly over the phone"". Hundreds of dollars for junk..."
4677,2.0,2021-11-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Good overall but started rusting from the outside. Front panel is covered with many rust spots
4678,5.0,2018-11-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this espresso machine because it is easy so easy to make lattes and capuccinos. I have had a DeLonghi and a Jura and this beats both of them! The price is exceptional for the quality of this machine.
4679,5.0,2017-03-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this Expresso machine so much I made a video about making coffee in it! You can check it out if you're interested: [...]
4680,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This machine may make good espresso or lattes and cappuccinos but within 2 years it will break down. My husband and I have owned two of these. The first one died around 2 years of age. We had it repaired for about $300 but it lasted a mere 6 months. The second we purchased new lasted a mere 1.5 years. We attempted to repair it with no results. The company has very poor customer support. Good luck communicating with them at the best of times. We will not purchase from this company again. I noted they have now produced even more expensive units! Ridiculous! Don't waste your money.
4681,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,It was a gift to my son and he says it is great!
4682,1.0,2017-05-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Don't waste your money on this machine. I am on my second one, the motors are crap and Beeville customer service is just as crappy as their products. If you need repairs or replacement. YOU must pay to ship the machine to Los Angeles where they will keep it for at least a month. They will not send you a loaner like Nespresso will. My second one is now cropping out, all it does now is make strong coffee. It is out of warranty and I will be happy when it goes in the trash."
4683,2.0,2020-02-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,I don't mind paying this much for a machine that will last and is high quality AND NOT MADE IN CHINA. This machine is made by an Australian company that designs them and has China produce them very cheaply. This is fine for a Mr. Coffee -- I expect that to break in two years. I don't expect this on an expresso machine that is now priced at $700. This machine cost $500 only a year or so ago. What changed? It's still made in China. It's about time that consumers demanded quality and value for their money. This machine should last ten years or more at this price range.
4684,5.0,2014-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,I would consider myself a coffee snob and have had to deal with inconsistent cappuccino from all over the country for many years until I bought this unit. The great thing is to come home and be able a very consistent high quality coffee every time. It is very easy to use. Easy to keep clean (important). A great Aussie brand.
4685,5.0,2018-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,A small learning curve.....works well great coffee
4686,2.0,2015-09-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes great espresso and grinds well, but with great care and continuous backlashing my wife and I can't get one to last more than a year before it starts acting up.

FIRST ONE - I bought our first one almost two years ago and after about 8 months of using it it started to not work properly. These are not cheap espresso makers, which upset me. This thing should last for years. Breville was good about replacing it without any hassle.

SECOND ONE - We have now had the second unit for almost 8 months now and it too is starting to not give the proper pressure to make espresso and the pump is starting to give us trouble. I back flush the machine every few weeks (which is more than the manual even recommends), I also flush it out with vinegar and replace the water filters regularly.

This is extremely frustrating for spending so much money on an espresso machine."

4688,1.0,2016-03-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I purchased this machine from a local store (not Amazon), and it has worked well for just over 3 years, but now the machine leaks despite cleaning it regularly, it trips the circuit breaker, the pressure is nil, and it makes loud buzzing sounds, which, from what I've seen on youtube indicates the solenoids need to be replaced. No problem, I can do that, right! Except the parts are on factory backorder with no delivery date, and many of other parts for the machine are obsolete -- and Breville is still selling this model?!?

So I just purchased a DE’LONGHI LA SPECIALISTA from Amazon. Hopefully the new machine lasts longer than 3 years before it quits. My Breville is going in the trash. I hate giving bad reviews, but I spent $600 on this machine - and it only lasted 3 years!"
4689,1.0,2013-07-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this machine a within the year the pump needed to be replaced... lucky it was under manufacturer warranty. The process to send the machine back to get it fix last for about a month and a half.

We have been really careful and on top of the maintenance, performing descaling every 2 months and here we are again with a broken machine. Based on the issues can be the solenoid or even the water pump again... with the replacement they gave us 6
Months warranty and broke on month 7...

This time they want to charge me $250 for a tech to take a look and replace/fix the part. Customer service is awful and once again... not worthy...."
4690,5.0,2015-07-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,Super easy to use. I just love it. Great high quality.
4691,1.0,2015-04-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Have bought several Breville products, including espresso machine and burr grinder. Espresso machine ~$500 failed after 15 months. $400 for shipping for repairs. Forget about it. Called local espresso repair guy and he said to call back when I got a real espresso machine. Burr grinder lasted 2 years. No real service options. Breville makes good looking machines in China, but don't be fooled. They don't hold up and this company's support is terrible. Basically aesthetically appealing junk."
4692,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"He comprado 3. La primera duró un año. La moledora del café se daño aparte de eso hacía unos cafés irregulares. Un día bueno otros que no te lo podías ni tomar.
Acabe regalándola y compré la misma sin moledora. Al cabo de 6 meses el mismo problema. El Cafe terrible y salía como quemado y mal oliente. Esa fue pars la oficina. Luego la tercera tiene como un año y está dando problemas. La luz del clean no se apaga aunque la he limpiado miles de veces.
Hace un ruido tremendo al sacar el café terriblemente malo. La aguja de la presión no sube, porque no funciona bien.
Lo único bueno de la máquina es su vapor. Este nunca ha fallado, pero no vuelvo a tener otra más de esa marca en mi casa. Como dice la canción tropecé no dos no , 3 veces con la misma piedra. No puedo ver esa marca ni en pintura y no la recomiendo. 😡"
4693,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife purchased this unit for Father's Day 2015. To be honest, the first 6 months, it worked perfectly. However, then things went downhill. The unit has a sensor (I think it calculates water volume) that tells you when to clean it. When following the sensor's guidelines (two people drinking a couple of cups per day - about 4-5 weeks between cleanings), it takes only a few simple steps, but about 25 minutes to clean / rinse per instructions. However, if you're in an area with hard water, even if using cold water from a kitchen sink secondary filtration system, the unit's water lines and heating unit will become calcified to the point where you'll have to clean the unit 4-5 times consecutively (as per Breville phone customer service) in order for the system to generate enough heat (steam) to produce an espresso. What we found ourselves doing was proactively cleaning the unit about every 2 weeks to try to stay ahead of it. That time period has now shrunk to weekly. Keep in mind, the tablets (packs of 8) are not cheap and we haven't found them anywhere but online (Amazon Prime, actually), and the cleaning process uses about 1/3 gallon of vinegar as well. However, the weekly cleaning has proven inadequate as well. We've tried to let the machine take it's time to generate the heat needed, but it's now no longer making coffee at all, as in not even pouring out slowly through the grinds.

Another pitfall is that the grounds must be cleaned each time, versus some of the other units disposing of them in an internally stored bucket (albeit more expensive units).

It's a nice looking unit and fun to use, if you enjoy the 'art' of making coffee. But, the aggravation you'll experience within the 1st year takes the fun out of the equation."
4694,5.0,2021-03-15, Black Sesame,This is a great espresso machine. The previous review said they had this 15 months and it didn't last. That is impossible because this just came out earlier this year in May of 2013. They must be referring to the last model. At least take the time and review the correct model.
4695,2.0,2014-09-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,My husband bought this as a gift for me 2 years. It stopped producing the pressure to express after about 10 months. After arguing with Breville they sent me another one which I’ve had for about 10 months. Pressure still works but stream of coffee is slow and too much crema. Very convenient coffee maker but if it doesn’t make good coffee it’s not worth it.
4696,1.0,2017-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife and I bought this machine as a wedding gift for ourselves. We loved it!

Sadly, it has proven twice now that it isn't a reliable machine :(

Please read the rest of the one star reviews for this machine. At first it works great...but if you are the kind of person who plans on using a machine like this daily, think twice.

We take really good care of our stuff. We followed all the instructions to clean and care for the machine.

Our first machine stopped working after 6 months, it took FOREVER to get Breville to acknowledge this issue. Once they did...they had us mail the machine to a repair shop. It took over a month to come back. ~9 months later...same problem. Took even longer for Breville to acknowledge the issue. This time they had us mail the machine back.

I really just want my money back...because after reading all the other reviews here it feels like our machine is going to stop working again in another 9 months (we use it about 3 times each day).

If you are not going to make espressos very often...it might work for you. But if you plan on using it daily...it seems that this machine consistently stops working after about 9 months, read the other reviews of customers whom have used this machine for that period of time.

The customer service experience makes things even more frustrating."
4697,1.0,2016-02-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine makes great espresso. However, there is a steam ring that wears out over time or occasionally tears. The machine won't function without it. It's inexpensive and easy to change and wouldn't be a big deal except they are impossible to obtain. Breville cannot keep them in stock. There are brief periods where they show as available on the Breville website, and you can place an order, but it will be cancelled after a couple days and the site will show them as sold out again. Meanwhile your $600 machine is sitting useless on your counter. I have tried the aftermarket steam rings and none of them work. I would not recommend buying this machine unless you first stock up on real Breville steam rings."
4698,1.0,2019-12-28, Black Sesame,"I received this as a gift. I've been using a Nespresso machine for the last several years. I thought this might be a great way to save money in the long run by ditching expensive Nespresso capsules in favor of much less expensive (and fresher) whole bean coffee. After assembling the machine and doing several test runs, I could never get two-shot brews to dispense equal volume to both cups. This has a much larger countertop footprint. It requires much more cleaning and maintenance. Making espresso requires 10 times the amount of time and fare more clean-up compared to my Nespresso machine. So while initially excited by this item, unless I had a domestic staffer to operate, clean, and maintain it (and even then, many reviews have been downgraded later due to bad long term reliability and durability), it makes my Nespresso machine look like a dreamy combination of convenience, ease of use, instant gratification, and 100% consistent results. I returned the Breville product, wishing I had not wasted my time assembling it and disassembling it."
4699,2.0,2017-01-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought this machine from Bed, Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. All was well until about a month ago when the machine started making electrical buzzing noises when we tried to pull a shot. Looked on You Tube and was discouraged to see how many others have experienced the same problem with machines either just out of the warranty date or actually still in the warranty period. I have contacted Breville and they have suggested decalcifying the machine with a special solution available at a local retailer. I will follow through but don't have a lot of confidence in this procedure as I read many comments by others on You Tube who did the same thing to no avail. I have extra warranty protection through my credit card so have a feeling I will be sending the machine in for repair which is very annoying as we spend over $600 on this machine and I feel it should have lasted much longer for the price we paid. Then there is the turn around time for the machine to be returned to us.....who knows how long that will take??? Will try and update if and when the problem is solved! Would not recommend this product due to it's apparent short shelf life!"
4700,1.0,2020-04-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"since i got the machine , i called the Breville customer service 8 times and there is no way you can speak to someone , you have to live your number and pray to God that they call you back ..at the 8th times they called me back , they got serial number and all the information and the person could not fix the problem and told me to stay on the line for higher level support ..after waiting on the line for 1 hour 10 minutes , i gave up .."
4701,2.0,2022-04-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love it when it works! We are on our 3rd one in just over a year, and now I have to send it in for repair after 3 months. First 2 were replaced with a new one (after 5 1/2 months each). Solenoid valve doesn't seem to last over 6 months. Customer service has been good so far, but don't know what will happen when it goes out again. And even though it's under warranty now, it means packing up and shipping and going without the machine for a week or 2 each time. Wish they would find a way to make it last because it's a great concept but I am concerned that we spent all that money on something that doesn't work very long at all and will be costly to repair once out of warranty. Seems to go bad after cleaning/descaling and this appears to be an issue that has happened to others."
4702,5.0,2018-05-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my machine. I use it daily. After five years, I have certainly gotten my money out of my ""investment"" ... Was worth every penny to me."
4703,1.0,2015-04-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After 11 months of use, the pressure stopped working. After multiple emails with customer service telling me it was my fault, or 'the beans' were the wrong kind, they finally directed me to send it to a local appliance superstore, where 'a guy' comes in once a week to service the kitchen appliances. They had stopped servicing their warrantied products by a dedicated espresso machine sales and service shop years earlier. Too costly, I guess. Needless to say, 'the guy' was unable to fix it. After many more emails and phone calls, Breville finally replaced it. I counted 30 emails over the course of about 5 weeks. Huge hassle. Terrible service, be forewarned! Footnote: the replacement machine lasted exactly a year, then same problem. Complete waste of money. I would give it zero stars if I could"
4704,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So this is probably the best espresso maker in terms of what it can do. I give it 5 stars for making excellent coffee but 0 for durability. Now to the important part no one is mentioning about this machine.

We are on #7 in less than 2 years. Thankfully we purchased at Best Buy and bought a extended warranty that allows us to exchange unit out in store for a new one if defective. 5 units have started making horrible noises after about 3 months of use. Research indicates this is due to solenoid valve failure. 2 units have had issues with overheating and grinder stopped working followed by machine failing to turn on. Both are known issues with this machine if you google and do some in depth research. Our usage is for home use making 15-20 individual shots a day plus frothing milk etc. Yes we drink a lot of coffee but still the machine should hold up a little better. Yes we can fix a solenoid valve but I expect better life than a few months. Great machine but quality is lacking for a $600 machine."
4705,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It's all hype! It's all about the name. We got a Breville blender like 5 years ago and we were so happy to got what mst people say is a good quality brand. We use it sparingly but then we discovered that the silver finish started rotting or pealing away. Not that we dont take care of it; but we do. We clean it everytime we use it and wipe dry the outside with a soft lint free cloth. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHINESE MANUFACTURER OF BREVILLE IN CHINA IS NOT A GOOD ONE JUDGING ON WHAT IS HAPPENING ON ITS SILVER FINISH. SO WHAT DO WE DO? WE DAY ""SAYONARA, GOODBYE BREVILLE"" we will be looking at other brands when we buy kitchen appliances and have literally eliminated your name from our list. My 2 boys who recently married agreed with us to not have Breville on their list. AU REVOIR..! There are other better brands: All our Kitchenaid equipment never failed us: inside and out."
4706,1.0,2015-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this in February of 2014. It has brewed an ""okay"" cup of espresso, much better than other espresso machines that I purchased in the past. However, the pump has quit working and no longer steams milk. Before iy quit working, it would often ""act"" like it was going to steam, but would instead build up pressure inside of the machine, to the point of dangerous. When you would turn the knob to run hot water, steamy water would shoot out since the steaming wand did not work. I would have expected a nearly $600 machine to last much longer than what I have gotten out of it. I'm disappointed in it. Never again will I spend that much money on any machine. Seems like stuff these days is pure garbage and only made to last as long as the warranty does, and if it does last and you still have warranty left, chances are you'll spend more money than it's worth mailing the machine back and forth to be fixed."
4707,2.0,2020-11-19, Black Sesame,"We loved this machine until 2 days ago when the extraction suddenly reduced and would not provide the full 2oz for a double espresso. Machine, filter, and portafilter cleaned per Breville instruction book, reduced pressure to tamping coffee grind, no improvement. When no coffee in the filter, correct volume is dispensed. Settings have not been changed since initial set up in August. I have contacted Breville customer support and we will see what they respond. May also return to Amazon for replacement. Really disappointed as we have loved using this machine...for 2 months..."
4708,1.0,2021-10-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Breville USA Worst Customer Service. I called 6 times. Not once did they accept the notion that my machine was defective. Issues: Single serving would only pour a tsp of liquid instead of an ounce. Pressure gage never was within range. Water leaked into the storage compartment instead of the tray where it is supposed to go and I had to empty it every 5 coffees. Customer Service told me: my coffee was too old clogging up the system, I should use the dual wall 2 cup filter for a single cup to increase pressure - despite the fact that it totally contradicts manual and I was using grinded coffee beans from the machine and not an outside source. Then they told me that the problem was that I had used an espresso roast and that the machine works best with light roast. The excuses went on and on. Finally one day I called Breville Canada by mistake and upon once again describing the problems they immediately said that the machine was defective. So I returned it."
4709,1.0,2019-10-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’m at a loss with this product. I am a coffee addict and LOVE LOVE the americanos that this machine produces. However the kicker is that the machine doesn’t last as long as your $500-600 investment. I should also admit that this opinion comes from someone who has two of these machines. The first one was bought and loved so much that it was replaced the minute that it took a dive. However after the second one had the same problems, my high opinion started to change. I would agree with the negative reviews, a great machine that is impossible to maintenance. The cleaning process doesn’t seem to truly do the job. The two machines I had, had parts go out because of scale buildup which wasn’t cleaned with the regular machine cleaning. After a $1000+ investment, I’m now on the hunt for a great machine that doesn’t have these types of problems. Maybe a professional machine ? If there are any suggestions I am ALL ears ?!?"
4710,2.0,2017-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great espresso maker. However, after one month the auto-grinder started spitting out way too little grind for the double puck. Then it stopped working altogether. Tried doing the ""advanced"" grinder cleaning almost every couple weeks for 4 months straight. Sometimes got better but never returned to original performance. Finally, after untightening a bolt (part of advanced cleaning procedure) repeatedly over the past few months, the bolt sheared off and broke in half. Now there is no working the auto grinder at all. There's also no way to repair the grinder without sending it in and paying more than it's worth. Really disappointed after spending the extra $100 for the espresso maker model with the auto grinder attached. It's been a continual headache. I expected more from this machine based on the other reviews and the price tag. Will see if Breville responds, but I'm not holding my breath. Will update review if customer service helps out."
4711,2.0,2015-04-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine simply can not make coffee consistently from cup-to-cup. Changing no variables (beans, grind, amount, etc.), half of the time it works fine. The other half, however, is either under pressure so it's weak or so over pressure it's bitter and undrinkable. I'm done wasting my time trying to get it to work consistently. If I could return it for a full refund I would. If you haven't purchased yet, keep looking."
4712,3.0,2014-06-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have really enjoyed my lattes every morning since I have purchased this machine. My only complaint is that it is definitely for home use only. When making two cups for my husband and I in the morning, the steamer wand becomes difficult on the second cup. I would say that the performance of this ""home use espresso maker"" is less than it should be considering it is a $500+ machine. The quality of the machine is good but the performance of the steamer wand is poor. I wanted to use this at my daughter's wedding shower but unfortunately the performance is too poor."
4713,1.0,2016-01-22, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Please be careful!! I had my Breville almost two years to the day. The coffee was great. One day I went to froth the milk and the water was not coming out. I turned the machine off and went to remove the wand with the coffee in it. As I put my hand on the wand and turned, the whole thing exploded off. Steam came in my face and almost burned me. Coffee grounds were everywhere!! On my clothes, the wall, the floor...I contacted Breville, but they want to charge me $239 for the repair. The warranty is only good for one year. They acknowledged the problem was inside the machine and there was nothing I could do prevent it from exploding, its just not under warranty. So..I guess to use this product, I need to spend an extra $239 every two years??"
4714,1.0,2018-07-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I wish I had read reviews before. I have had my machine for 6 months now and it is already being sent back to get fixed. I wrote the managers at Breville to express my concern over this machine already needing service just after 6 months and having spent so much on it and they said we will fix it and send it back . They only replace before 3 months! I am sorry but when you spend this much on a product, it should last longer than these machines are lasting !!!
Don’t take a chance unless you have the money to spend. When it was working it was pretty good but it isn’t made to be used daily.."
4715,2.0,2014-09-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I just bought this....I happy with it minus a few hiccups. If my coffee is not tapped just right...it won’t lock into place.😥. And, my pressure Doesn’t stay constant after the first cup....goes Very low and makes a Terrible cup of espresso/cappuccino. 😥. Do, for the price....it’s not what I thought it would be. Pretty disappointed. Also, the customer service through Breville are Absolutely NO help. Hopefully I can figure it out to stop these hiccups or it’ll be returning it."
4716,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"* A $700 machine starts failing in 13th month of usage!
* The machine does 230ml coffee shot on both single Or double expresso option
* Resetting the machine to factory doesn't help of course
* Custom setting also doesn't get memorized
* Most likely a failed mother board's component - no self-fix option.
In summary, stay away from this Breville BES870XL, especially for this price tag."
4717,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought my machine in April 2013 and used it without incident until this week when the machine not only failed but failed catastrophically spewing high pressure steam. I am very fortunate I did not require a trip to the hospital. The failure began when I finished pulling the coffee and turned the steam selector on to froth milk. Water began slowly trickling out of the steam wand. Then it began slowly trickling out of the portafilter as well. After I turned the steam selector off, when I removed portafilter from the cradle, high pressure steam and grinds spewed everywhere. I turned the machine off and it continued to spew water. I unplugged the machine and it still continued for another 30 secs.

Although I was outside of the one-year warranty I decided to alert customer service to this dangerous issue. I was until now a loyal Breville customer having purchased several of their products and recommended this exact Barista Express machine to a friend. When I spoke with customer service the representative offered to fix the machine for a flat fee of $239 and provide a 6 month warranty or provide 35% off the purchase of a new machine with the standard year warranty. The Breville representative also told me twice that I was the problem and he could troubleshoot the issue over the phone.

Essentially Breville wants to either charge me a flat fee to fix their product sight unseen, but also tells me I'm the problem, dismissing that the machine failed dangerously and asking me to risk my safety again by turning the machine on and 'troubleshooting' problems with high pressure steam. I'll save my cash and avoid a potential trip to the burn unit by putting this machine in the trash where it belongs."
4718,2.0,2020-08-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I received the Breville BES870XL from Amazon as a gift. The first machine had a defective water pump (i.e. dead on arrival). I exchanged it through Amazon for a new one. The second one worked out of the box.
The Breville BES870XS has a lot of different settings. It has all the relevant adjustments one would need to brew great Espresso. But unfortunately the quality of the components is too low to get consistent results. After several weeks of experimentation and 4 pounds of espresso beans I gave up. I even tried to brew 3 cups of espresso with the exact same parameters (same grind amount, setting, same brew settings) one after the other. Each one turned out differently.
This machine reminds me of a cheap stereo system with lost of adjustments and equalizer. One can try to adjust the settings all day long, but one will never hear great music because the components are too cheap.
I suspect that the manufacturing quality control is lacking. Others report to have success and they my very well have a well functioning machine. However I can not get any consistently good results with this machine.
I would highly recommend to buy a better quality brand, but if you are on a budget make sure your machine works well or return it to Amazon (NOT Breville!) immediately ."
4719,5.0,2016-06-18, Black Sesame,"Easy to operate and makes a perfect cup of coffee every time.
Noting to complain about. Excellent product.
You need to learn how to use it."
4720,2.0,2017-07-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine completely shuts down when its time to descale. no heads up, just stops working with flashing lights."
4721,2.0,2015-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very discouraged to see plastic inside of the portafilter as it is not good for steaming water to be in contact with plastic, even if it is BPA free. Otherwise, it is a beautiful machine."
4722,1.0,2014-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine doesn’t actually pour espresso. It makes a weak coffee and, unless your full time job is coffee influencer, with months of time to finely tamper the dose, control the perfect temperature, or grow and roast your own beans at home, it will not work. Specifically, apparently, in a logic and physics defying explanation, freshest beans are needed for the machine to create any pressure. I wander how that’s not the case for Delonghi or any other machine? Maybe thoughts and prayers will help, who knows. It bears noting that I also had this machine at work and tried everything, the four or five of us, did , to no avail. Some real coffee lovers in the crowd and even an ex Starbucks employee. So, save your money and buy something else. Piece of absolute garbage."
4723,1.0,2014-11-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Owned this machine for several years now. Just after the first year warranty expired, we had to send it back to Breville to get fixed as the steamer had stopped steaming and there was no pressure. Got it back about 3 weeks later. It worked like new for about another 6 months then died again. Spoke to Breville and told them it had the same issues. They wanted nearly $300 to 'service' it. After watching several youtube videos on this machines issues we bought a solenoid valve from a parts distributor and fixed the pressure issue. Then a month later the steamer went out again. We have given up now and bought a different machine. Too much work just to get a coffee!"
4724,2.0,2016-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"When it works it works well but I have been through 2 of these in the last year and a half. Both had the same issue, the pump seems to stop working correctly and emits a loud buzzing sound. The problem occurred after a few months with the first machine and it was replaced by Breville. The replacement unit had the same issue just after the warranty expired. When i called Breville they though the issue might be cause by the machine not being de-scalled but I descalled it regularly per the user manual. I finally threw the machine away this weekend since it stopped work completely.

When it was new it did make very good coffee. The portafilter is very shallow and overflows when being filled. If it wasn't for the durability issues it would have been a great machine."
4725,1.0,2019-07-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas December 2018 under my own Amazon prime account. He did not assemble and use it until June of 2019 and has had several operational problems. The machine is junk. It works 50% of the time and requires constant cleaning. And the latte tastes like crap. It is not his error either. I am so disappointed as this was not just a Christmas present for him but a retirement gift as well and I paid top dollar for it. Do not waste your hard earned money on this. I am going to research other machines and then use this POS for a boat anchor. Susan
4726,2.0,2020-01-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It was great until it start tripping my GFCI outlet every time I used to the point I couldn’t even plug it in without tripping the outlet. Aside from this the coffe is amazing, and super fun to make every day. Looks sleek and stylish but none of that matters if it’s unsafe to use after only two years of daily use. For the money it should last longer than that."
4727,2.0,2014-10-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really do love this espresso maker, however the grinder quickly becomes useless. I have spent hours upon hours cleaning it, but it gums up again and again. At this point, I only use ground espresso and this maker will make a good espresso, however it kind of defeats the purpose of having a built in grinder if it can not be used."
4728,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was about to order this. Based on reviews, it works good for some people and not so good for others. But what made me decide against this product is non-existent customer support. Up on reading many comments on the lack of customer support, I decided to call the customer support before buying the product to experience it first hand.
I made the call at 4:30 PM Pacific time.
Based on the warranty document, they are available 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM (Pacific Time) Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Today is Monday 6/19/2017, and not a Holiday.
All I got was, our office is now closed, please call back during regular business hours.
So yeah, If you can provide customer support to me.
I can't buy stuff from you!"
4729,2.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am giving this two stars instead of one because maybe I just don't know how to use this thing. But I will say that I have repeatedly tried EVERYTHING. Different grinds, tamping pressure, level of coffee (even with use of the supplied razor). But even so, one shot is too little pressure and another is too much. It is nearly impossible to get a proper cup of espresso out of this thing. Now I like to think of myself as handy with machinery in general and really wanted this to work. But this is like flying a fighter plane and its just not worth the effort. I will just get a $600 Starbucks card and go with that instead for God's sake."
4730,1.0,2013-07-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought this machine about a year ago. I like the way it brews coffee. But the milk frother wand is getting rust and now it's all the way up to plastic and i don't want to use the rust wand. I contact the customer service. What they said was it happened because I didn't clean it after use. Of course i cleaned everytime and it's not milk buildup it's rust from the stainless steel. Breville need to exchange the wand.
4731,1.0,2016-01-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've heard great things about this machine. But as soon as I opened it to set it up for my fiance as a gift I realized it was a used machine. When I ordered it, it specifically said it was a NEW item! I am so embarrassed, I am glad I was here when it got here. I am not happy, I will have to return it. I received a dirty machine full of coffee grounds all over!"
4732,2.0,2019-08-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was about to purchase, but no way after reviews. Seems like Breville does not know customer service."
4733,1.0,2014-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine works great, got it for Christmas from my partner and have been using it sensethen! we are really conscious with our health and what we put in our body we eat all organic foods and try and be as healthy as possible. The clean me light came on the other day so I go back to the manual to see how to clean it and what do I find other than a prop 65 warning that this product has chemicals known to cause cancer!? WTF I'm am blown away by this! First off $500 is so much F'in money to spend on something that is essentially killing me we are 20 yrs old it took her quite a bit of saving for that machine. Should have known breville would pull some sh like this... lost for words doesn't even deserve a star.. all the organic milk and beans I've wasted..."
4734,1.0,2014-09-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,One of the worst espresso machines I've ever dealt with.. I'm retired and financially independent so I go through all of every type that I wanted everything and I love the Breville drip coffee and the Breville Burr grinder but this is pressing machine sucks I've have a YouTube video on it where I show how terrible is it impossible to get a halfway decent espresso I actually take the $600 machine I could have taken it back but for the YouTube video I smashed it all over the road as a statement of how bad this piece of junk is it cannot make a good espresso there is no difference from zero pressure 200 this is poorly made in for company like this they should be ashamed of themselves
4735,2.0,2015-04-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Worked perfectly the first 2 or so months. Steamer shoots only water not steam everytime I used it. Now after cleaning the machine through the instructions given by the company, the machine no longer turns on."
4736,2.0,2016-03-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"First of all, I love the coffee!! The reason it only gets 3 stars is that after 2 years, it starts leaking water over the counter. I call service and for about $250 they will repair if I send it back. For $379 I can get a new one. If you buy this, be aware that it is a complicated device and high reliability is probably not on top of their list during design and manufacture.
update: I now have 3 of them (again, love the coffee!) the first is out of commission, the second is making bad buzzing noises when i first start brewing. I don't think I will get another (fool me twice...)"
4737,1.0,2016-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine 2,5 years ago and I did some research before I pull the trigger . I saw a few bad reviews about the water pump but I decided to buy it anyways since there was a lot of good reviews. Right now the machine doesn’t work. I called costumer support and I told them that I just want to buy the part and install it but they refuse to do so and to fix it it’s almost the same price as buying a new one. They offered a discount to buy a new one. What a joke. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A DIFFERNT MACHINE."
4738,2.0,2016-08-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The machine makes as good or better lattes than Starbucks or your local coffee shop (after much practice).

I wish I knew which part(s), chemical(s), and/or compound(s) required Breville to add a CA Prop 65 warning to the owners manual about the machine. Also, I don't see the reason for the plastic piece in the portafilter. I took this plastic piece out."
4739,1.0,2019-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I didn't like anything. I called to ask if it was possible to buy an extended warranty if I purchased the Breville Barista Express no kidding, put my phone number in to receive a call and waited FOUR hours. Why would anyone want to put up with that. If something was wrong with my appliance I have no faith that I would be addressed. I'd just throw the product out. I would say that is not something I would want to do; throw out a $600+ appliance."
4740,2.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Missing:cleaning disk,cleaning tablets,allen key,cleaning tool,coffee scop and cleaning brush. This makes me bitter."
4741,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We purchased this espresso maker on 11/13/18 and used it at a second home on a very part-time basis and by March 18, 2019, it no longer worked. Boiler stopped building up enough pressure for the water to push through the grounds. This is our 4th Breville espresso maker (we like the looks of them and that they are easy to use), but three others stopped working after a year. Time to find another brand!"
4742,1.0,2016-09-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"There is no need to write a treatise on what has already been written about this machine. Instead, I'll post the highlights that others have already covered: there exists a decent chance this machine will break in a year(ish), Breville's customer service is horrible, and, after Breville makes a half-hearted attempt at fixing it, your machine will, without fail, break again.

When I bought mine about a year ago (Nov. 2016), I even did so directly from Breville in order to make customer service easier in the event it broke. I wish I had listened to the negative reviews and never bought it in the first place.

Do not buy this espresso machine. It is garbage, and Breville is garbage."
4743,1.0,2016-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine has never performed well for me, coffee was always either too bitter or too sour. I even ordered coffee beans from them so the customer service would not keep telling me my beans are sub par quality. Now after 2 yrs the machine is broken and useless. The internet is full of videos about fixing, pumps, gaskets, valves, etc. Buy it if you want to start a fixing hobby. Its a joke!"
4744,2.0,2020-06-23, Brushed Stainless Steel,Stopped working after 2’months. I expected this $500 plus machine to last longer than the old $40 Capresso. Customer Service is having ‘technically difficulties’ and the web site chat is down. Not too happy with this huge waste of money. Was great for 2 months -
4745,2.0,2015-12-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"While I don't have this exact machine, I have a Mr. Coffee machine and it makes kick ass espresso and cappuccino no problemo. I don't have all of the fancy gauages and stuff, but I pulled an espresso shot with crema my first time out with the machine. I also made micro foam and heated milk my first time out.

I am not a barista by no means, but my results means an absolute gonad can pull cappuccino shots and foam up 2% milk in the time it takes to read this little article. Again, I'm am no barista by any means, but I know my way around machines and am able to make cappuccino no problem. I can even make that silly ass 2% milk art.

So people, if you have a half way decent espresso machine, you are well on your way to excellent espresso and your credentials as a barista."
4746,1.0,2015-08-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Terrible Machine!
Our Barista Express started failing about 18 months after purchasing from William Sonoma. WS will not accept returns, nor do they stock the parts, so they are completely useless when the machines malfunction. The $170 in parts ordered from a 3rd party company have been on backorder for 4 months!!! I have a machine on my counter that I just don't know what to do with--may end up tossing the $&#^$ machine in the trash!!
Save your money and energy and run from the Breville Barista Express!"
4747,1.0,2016-09-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Before you buy this you need to know this. If anything goes wrong you are out of luck. This worked great for the first year. I kept it clean and scaled. When the steam stopped working I contacted Breville, after holding to speak to someone for 2 hours. The warranty had expired two months before. They do not have any repair shops in the 2 states I live in and next to. They only have one repair shop in the United States, in Illinois. To send it you need to pay $250 up front. No guarantee they can fix anything. So be aware. It makes great coffee but if anything goes wrong you are out of luck."
4748,1.0,2022-04-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is great when it works. I’ve been using this machine every day for 1 to 2 espressos for 2 years. It’s been great, loved the product until out of no where the pump stopped working. I can mail it to Breville for a cool $240 and they’ll fix it or I can buy a new one for another $600. I’ll pass!! J U N K"

4750,1.0,2015-09-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Very, very disappointing!!! 2 and 1/2 years in and the machine is broken! However, according to the service rep., I can have my machine shipped and serviced for $239- seriously!!!! How about standing behind your product Breville? If you’re paying $600 for an expresso machine, you expect it to last more than 2 and 1/2 years!!! Fine, it can be fixed but $239, come on! Will not buy any other Breville product and will not recommend to anyone!"
4751,1.0,2022-04-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Please please becareful when lifting the package because the outer most package is made out of very flimsy material. The entire espresso machine fell out of the bottom of the package when I was lifting the box off of the ground. It fell from about a height 12"" and the gauge never turned no matter what setting I put on. Sad I didn't even get to taste a proper cup of espresso."
4752,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This item used to be closer to $500 now it’s $700. No way man that is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. You’re funny!
4753,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Bought the machine about 2 years ago. About a year in and I got the regularly reported buzzing, despite cleaning, descaling, etc. Never got better, only worse. Customer support is *awful* despite any other comments to the contrary. Breville support website crashed any time I tried submitting a ticket (multiple browsers, multiple systems, not on my end), and I have *NEVER* been able to get ahold of a real person to talk to. They never answer the phones during published hours, and they now have a ""ring back"" feature which doesn't return your calls. I have called at least a dozen times over the last year when I have time to try to deal with it, but no success.

I finally got an online ticket in, and got a delayed reply telling me to try cleaning it a few times, but that has been the extent of the communication."
4754,2.0,2014-08-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Machine worked great for two years - Grinder stopped working this week and Breville wants $230 to fix it, that is 40% [FORTY] of the original price. I understand that the warrantee expired but, if a company wants to charge that much money to fix a simple piece of the machine I can not recommend it to anyone"
4755,1.0,2017-11-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,This product is terrible. I have owned it for 3 months now. It is now NOT working. I have googled how to fix it.. unsuccessful! I am more than disgusted with this product and I expect a call of some sort to remedy my problem!!!!!
4756,2.0,2014-07-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Great looking machine, however it stopped working after less than 7 months of light use. There is not enough pressure for a good pull."
4757,1.0,2018-09-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I , like others on this review thread, gave it 5 stars. But give it time, you will hate this thing too. This machine breaks after 18 mos. The water tank leaks from the back. It's all over in reviews. Hundreds complain about it and it is a $239 fix from Breville. So you are paying basically $800 for two years of service from this. You buy an appliance for this much $, you expect it to last at least 3-4 years. This piece of junk isn't worth it. And customer service is poor. Stay away. They know they have an issue with their design but refuse to do anything about it."
4758,1.0,2021-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine expecting it to be the last espresso machine I would ever need. $800., more than my excellent dishwasher. Unbelievable disappointment .I have now had this for about two years but it started to disintegrate within the first few months in the following order.. First, the magnetic tamper no longer attached to the magnetic. Second, , after a few months the grinder stopped working. I did everything recommended but it did not help. The manufacturer stonewalled me . So, I ground coffee in my old and reliable Krups grinder. Then I noticed that this so-called stainless steel product was peeling on the outside and found that it was not stainless at all but some other metal coated with a thin coat of fake stainless-looking material, can't say what it is. Peels like paper, The latest is that the electrical part broke down and it no longer turns on at all. So much for $800. bucks. DO NOT BUY if you expect to get value for your money or even espresso."
4759,2.0,2015-04-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Nothing but frustration- the bean grinder plugged up repeatedly and the pressure gauge stopped working. That's on two different machines!
Same problems, same model. At first I thought it was something I was doing or perhaps I got a lemon on the initial purchase. But then when
I took it back after several weeks, the second machine had the very same problems! For $600 I expect something better. If you buy one- and
they do seem well constructed on the surface- take a hard look at the store's return policy. Good luck!"
4760,5.0,2018-05-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This unit replaced my old 860XL that I owned for about 2 years. I LOVED my 860 and it was used nearly everyday a few times a day between myself and my wife. On the surface they look almost identical to each other, but they are very different machines. They look very similar, and that's good since the 860 is a VERY good looking machine. We always got compliments on how awesome the 860 looked in our kitchen.

The obvious changes are nice ones. The bean hopper is updated to provide better flow of the beans to the grinder. The old design would lead to the beans getting jammed up and not drop down, you had to frequently open the lid and help them down while it was grinding. While this is not a HUGE issue, it was a ""charming"" reality of the 860. The updated hopper on the 870 has had zero issue feeding beans to the grinder.

The hot water dispense is very nice to get things warmed up, I don't think I'll use it too much but it is nice to have it there.

Another noticeable change is an updated steam wand and gone is the ""froth enhancer"" of the 860. It seems the more powerful heating unit makes the most difference with the steam option. this unit pushes much more steam than the 860 could, it gets a good roll going and produces well textured milk quickly. The updated steam wand hands down performs better than the old unit with the enhancer.

As mentioned above another obvious change is a more powerful 1600w heater packed in this unit as opposed to the 1450w heater in the 860. I think the better heater was mandatory to run the hot water option and be able to update the steam wand to eliminate the need for a ""froth enhancer"". The updated heater is a home run in my opinion.

Some of the not so obvious changes are to the top of the unit, the round hopper allows for more storage space on top of the machine. I store my portafilter and filters up top and it all fits very nice. I keep the double shot filters up top and I store the single shots under the unit in the hidden store bin. I use the double wall filter for my pre and post brew ""blank"" runs. The pre brew is to warm up the head and make sure the head is clean, then I brew with the single wall filter, then I use the double wall filter again to run another blank run to help clean the head unit. The drip tray is also updated with a nicer stamped stainless steel cover that is more sturdy than the old stainless bar design of the 860 and I think it looks nicer. The unit comes with a frothing pitcher just like the 860 did, but even the pitcher is updated. It's made from a thicker stainless steel and it's a nice looking figured design. the frothing pitcher update was a very nice touch as the 860's looked and felt cheap, I never used it since I already had a nicer one. I actually want to use the 870's included pitcher.

The grinder also seems to be better. I can get a much finer grind than I was able to get with the 860 and the grind timer seems to be better set up. on the 860 I had to have the grinder set to it's finest setting and the timer set to it's lowest possible setting so that it did not overflow the filter and start dumping coffee grinds all of the place. If I did not set it to it's finest setting it did not build enough pressure most of the time and I had to use a lot of tamping pressure to get a good extraction from he 860.

All of that has changed with the 870. I can set the grinder to about its halfway point with my current coffee and the timer is much better set up so that I don't have to have it all the way down. I have it set a few clicks into the timer and it does not overflow coffee grinds. Compared to the 860 where it was at it's lowest setting and it would still overflow grinds. Nothing major, but it did waste coffee...

With the grind set to 6, using FAR less tamping pressure than before I get consistent ""optimal"" pressure from the 870. Also using the new ""razor"" tool (very handy when you start to use and learn this machine). Once I learn the machine a bit better I think the razor tool will be put in storage, but it is nice to have.

What I think is one of the biggest improvements to the 870 over the 860 is the pre-infussion. The 860 used a stutter technique that was lacking. I never thought it was long enough while I owned the 860 and right away the whole ""stutter"" technique bothered me. It's never a good thing to make a high-pressure pump have to switch on and off all the time. Sure enough, the part that busted on my 860 that led me to the 870 was the pump. The 870's method is a consistent flow of low pressure water (how long is adjustable on this machine as well!). It does a MUCH better job prepping the espresso and I think it removes A LOT of abuse to the pump to help longevity.

If I had to find a flaw with the updated 870, I don't know if this just my unit or across the board. The filters are PIA to get out of the portafilter. The spring clip is MUCH tighter than my 860's. My wife can't get them out herself and I feel like I'm going to rip a fingernail clean off trying to get them out... I have an old small utility knife than I use to slip under the lip and pull it out. When I have more time I'll try to back off the spring clip and see if I can make it easier. This is not a huge problem and hey, what would a nice machine be without some kind of ""charm""...

When I brought the 870 home to replace my 860 I was fully expecting a minor facelift but essentially the same machine. I was VERY happy to be proven wrong. Breville took a very good 860 and reworked the entire unit to make an excellent 870. In my opinion Breville listened to the complaints about the 860 and took the time to replace it with a machine that would actually be an upgrade, all for the same price.

I hope this has been helpful!

*UPDATE* 12/30/2016

I have had this machine for over two years now. It is STILL running strong with zero issue. I decided to update this based on some reviews that claim the machine is not durable. I use this machine at least twice a day at this point, if not more.

I STRONGLY believe that cleaning is critical to the longevity of not only this machine, but ANY machine. I not only use the cleaning tablets when the machine tells me to, but I also run Dezcal and CleanCaf through the unit every couple of months. If you have hard water, you may want to run them more often.

I have made nearly a 1,000 shots of espresso (double shots) and steamed close to 400 cups of milk with this machine and I've had ZERO issues. I would bet money that A LOT of the machines that are ""broken"", have mineral build up issues that could have been prevented.

Mine is still a great machine and I'm still loving the heck out of it."
4761,2.0,2016-09-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Even though we followed instructions to the tee, we couldn't get the pressure valve to move. What came out can't by any means be qualified as coffee, it looked more yellowish than brown. Smell of coffee came only from grinding, not from the liquid. Overall, just a poor experience with this particular machine."
4762,1.0,2021-04-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have this machine. It is my third Breville machine in about 10 years, I got it at Williams Sonoma. The first one was excellent in every way. The second totally failed after three years of use (leaking), the current machine just crapped out 1/15/2017 (no pressure) after about three years. On day 1 I would have rated this machine *****. But that would have been too soon give it a rating.

Consider this: I am the only espresso drinker in the house, no one else uses the machine. I have an espresso most days, but never more than one. So it goes through fewer than 360 cycles/per year. I followed the maintenance schedule faithfully.

I have been in the queue for Breville customer service for about an hour. It is beside the point. This is my last Breville product ever."
4763,2.0,2021-06-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine lasted only 2 years! I've read reviews of others who have said the same! It works great for 2 years and then the steam pressure is gone. Breville will fix it for $250.00, but you have to send it. It's made in China so that says it all. Save your money, pay more get a machine made in Italy that will last for years!"
4764,1.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I bought mine in 2014 and the pump just failed for second time. First time they covered it under warranty but this time it's $240 to send in for repair. I clean and descale regularly just as the book recommends so I know it's not due to poor maintenance. I use the machine on average only 7 or 8 times a week so I know it's not overworked. When i bought this machine it was rated the best machine under $1000 but I am very disappointed in the long term quality.
4765,1.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It was great for about 5 months, then it broke. This is despite following all guides to cleaning and maintenance. When I contacted customer service they wouldn't deal with me because I wasn't in the US (currently living in South Korea). After a terrible experience dealing with the service center in Seoul, I had to send the machine in to get fixed. It then worked well for about another 4 or 5 months. Now it's broken again and after going through the same painful back and forth with the utterly useless customer service, I've sent it in again. I've just been told it's the same broken part, and that now after the warrantee is up it will cost $160 to repair. They refuse to replace the obvious lemon I've been sold. I regret buying from this company. I guess I'm going to have to spend a bit more an get the Rancilio Silvia, as it seems to be a better bet."
4766,1.0,2020-03-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,The machine worked great until we went to replace the filter and clean out the water tank. Suddenly we found the inlet filter mesh of the water tank completely rusted on one side?! What kind of crazy defect is this? I've been drinking espresso with contaminated with rust for who knows how long - this is completely disgusting and unacceptable!
4767,1.0,2018-01-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Id give this 0 stars if I could.

If you like frothy milk this machines NOT for you

If you like making espresso without following 10 steps only to find that THIS TIME the machine prefers a different grind size & gives a bad pour u have to trash it this machine is NOT for you

If you dont like wasting expensive coffee this machine is NOT for you

Very disappointed especially considering the price tag. Its definitely going back. My old Krups machine was 100xs better. The espresso shot on this might be better quality IF you can get the darn thing to pour a good shot!"
4768,1.0,2020-08-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Breville admits they do't offer spare parts for machine, if it leaks do to a simple o-ring, toss the Chinese made machine away as it is useless. Not very Green company as this causes our more trash and more wasted energy resources making new replacement machines because a 3 year old machine's o-ring can not be replaced. Sad. Should be illegal to sell product that are not supported."
4769,1.0,2022-04-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Just bought it yesterday at Fry's. Yes, the machine makes excellent coffee but as far as workmanship on the machine, I have to say, it's a pity! The machine run smooth the first 2 cups, but on the 3rd cup, as I attempted to grind the coffee, I heard a loud rattling noise during the grinding. It's not the usual buzzing when you have a smooth grinding. I stopped the machine right away by hitting the power button. I removed the bean container and took a peek inside the mill drum. I noticed something shiny sticking out and proceeded to remove the leftover coffee. It was a screw! I looked all around to see where that screw came from. I even checked the coffee container. No sign of screw hole!
With the mysterious screw outside, the grinder worked fine with the usual buzzing sound. I will return and exchange for a new machine because the mill drum had some minor damage, and on top of that, I have no idea where that screw came from."
4770,1.0,2021-07-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I bought this machine and within a few months the grinder quit. I contacted Breville and they replaced the machine. The second machine worked for another few months, and then the grinder also went out. Breville shipped me another machine. I was thinking that they were new machines but they were actually refurbished models. The third machine didn't work when I received it. I was told it could be my coffee was too old, and lots of other excuses. They shipped me another machine and this one was guaranteed to be new. The grinder on this one also quit after a few months. When I read some reviews I realized that the grinder was always a problem. The last machine also quit and I contacted Breville again, they would not respond in a timely manner. When they finally responded the machine was out of warranty, the original 12 months from when I purchased it. The best that they could do was send me the lesser model that didn't have a grinder built in. I agreed and that machine has worked perfectly. But my almost $700 machine was replaced by one costing more than $200 less. My advice don't buy this model, buy a Cuisinart burr grinder and the model without the built in grinder."

My email is ziaditani78@hotmail.com"
4772,1.0,2020-07-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We purchased this machine after doing a lot of research and reading the reviews. We were very disappointed and had to return it about 2 months after purchase! Every time we used the grinder, it would give off an awful burnt plastic smell. We noticed that the pressure on the espresso had also weakened after just a couple of weeks of use! If you spend $600, you don't expect to have issues like this! Utterly disappointed."
4773,5.0,2016-06-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After about one year of use I feel qualified to make a review on this machine. First off, it is fair to consider this grinder the same as Breville's dose control pro, so figure you are getting a roughly $200 grinder, and a $350-400 espresso machine when you buy this. I will say that this machine has held up well, and makes great espresso. (Maybe not the BEST ever, but better than any coffee shops in my area..) It does have a fair amount of plastic, but that's what you get in this price range. The spec sheet is amazing at this price point - PID, preinfusion, 3 way solenoid and volumetric control? Oh yeah.

Perhaps when this thing breaks down I will make the jump to ""pro-sumer"", but with a grinder and volumetrics that is $3k+. Hard to justify.

First off, I believe that to keep this guy in running shape there are a couple of major points: First, NEVER move the grind adjustment to a finer setting without the grinder operating. That stresses the grinder, and will lead to its failure. Next, do the cleaning cycles like you are supposed to. Someone on youtube suggested using a magnet that you turn 90 degrees each time you do a clean so you can remember what you need to do: tablet every time (buy cafiza instead of breville, far cheaper), vinegar every other time. and new filter every four cleanings. I don't have hard water where I live but I do this anyway. Finally, don't run it out of water. Pumps and heating elements don't like that.

***Next, I'll run down how I get an amazing shot out of this thing. First, two requirements:

1. Freshly roasted beans. This does NOT mean from a supermarket. You need to find someone local who roasts (ideally) or buy them online direct from a roaster. You need to know with certainty that they were roasted very recently. Your window is 4 days to 2 weeks, after that they are too old.
2. A digital scale that measures down to 0.1g. If you want to pull consistently awesome shots, you have to reduce as many variables as possible, and knowing exactly how much coffee if in your portafilter, and exactly how much beverage you are extracting by weight is the next step. I like the AWS pocket scale. Cheap! You MUST have a scale to dial in your shots. After all, you spent 600 on this machine - spend another 15 and learn how to pull shots consistently.

***Here is how I dial in a shot with a new type of bean. Once dialed I don't need to repeat this. Note that you should flush water through the machine before pulling a shot to get everything up to temp. ALWAYS!

1. Put the portafilter on your scale and tare it.
2. Set grinder at 5 to start, and keep the grinder set for the single shot with the grind time set around ""noon"" or less. (double seems to more than double the amount coming out for some reason?)
3. Grind in the single shot amount, then tap the PF and very lightly tamp the grounds to help distribution and free up some room for the second bit of grinding. Maybe this ""midway"" tamp is sacrilege - but my shots are great, and this helps keep grounds from overflowing and spilling out everywhere.
4. Grind in the rest, smooth it out keeping all the grinds in in the basket, and tamp it hard. You actually can't over tamp - once the air is out that's it, your grounds can't compress any further. Tamping further just wastes energy, but for now go harder than you think you need to. Once tamped, the metal part of the tamper should ""just"" disappear below the edge of the PF.
5. Put the PF on the scale and weigh your coffee. Make a note of this weight.
6. Put the scale under the spout, and your cup onto the scale and tare it.
7. Pull your shot manually, by programing the double shot button. Watch a couple of things. First - the pressure gauge. You want the needle right at the end (highest part) of the dark area. NOT in the middle! There is a very small range that seems perfect. If pressure did not hit correctly I don't worry about the next step which is weighing the shot - I just end it when it seems okay and dump a bunch of milk in it if I plan on drinking it, haha. Or throw it out. If pressure is low, click the grinder one step finer, and do the reverse if it is too high. Remember the grinder needs to run while you move the wheel - don't skip that!! Then repeat the above steps 3-7, but you'll need to adjust grind time to get the right amount of grounds (so the tamper metal part just disappears when tamped)
8. Assuming the pressure is now correct, keep an eye on the scale. You want to put roughly double the weight in liquid as was in your PF - depending on the beans and your tastes of course. But double is where you should start. So if you weighed out 17.5 g into the basket, you want to pull 35 g of espresso into the mug. Hit the button again to stop the flow when the weight is about 2 grams short of your target - scales are often a little slow to read and a bit more liquid will come out. If your weight is exactly double you nailed it, but honestly ""close enough"" is okay in my opinion. Now your double shot volume is set.
9. Drink it and freak out. That's it. Now your grind time is set for a consistent dose, and your extraction time/volume is set for the beans and grind. As long as you keep using the same beans and they are fresh, there is no need to touch volume settings or weigh anything. I just flush - grind - light tamp - grind - full tamp - double shot button. Very consistent shots, and easy to do in the morning when I am groggy. If I want to play around with doses and extractions the ""manual"" operation is always available without messing up my programmed settings.

***A couple of notes about this.

First, I do not decide ahead of time the weight of grounds I want to put in there. I put in the amount that gives me the clearance I want in the PF after it is tamped. I then use the scale to extract what I want, based on the amount of coffee in the basket. Most coffees will want 1:2 grounds to liquid, but this isn't a hard and fast rule. Experiment.

Second, the dose is based on grind time, so of course it isn't precise with weight. I find it to be extremely consistent, based on the clearance in the PF after I tamp, which is always the same. I tested it and it varies by 0.1 - 0.2 g, but I can't taste a difference so I don't care. If this matters to you, just weigh every time - the dose and the pull.

Finally, you'll note I didn't time the pull. I find that the weight of extraction is more reliable. In any case, if you do time it you'll be in the proper range with this method. With enough coffee to get the correct clearance after you tamp AND the pressure where it should be on the gauge, you'll pull a double in 30-35 seconds fairly consistently (including 8 seconds or so of preinfusion.)

This really is the beauty of this machine - once you dial in your shot it is pretty much foolproof and consistent.

Also, regarding the steamer - it is fine for what I do - flat whites in a capp sized mug. That usually means I'm steaming 4-5 ounces of milk. Microfoam and proper temp happen in 45 seconds or so. The machine gets steaming quickly and recovers quickly as well. No complaints! Be sure to wait until the steam is steady and dry - it will purge water for a bit."
4774,1.0,2020-04-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I really like this machine. Easy to use and the espresso was very good. However, the grinder stopped working after one day.

Answer NO! So I guess when it quits completely I will have to purchase a less expensive one as this one for the price tag of over $500 is strictly junk!"

After 30 minutes wait, I asked the rep for the differences between 2 models (Infuser and Barista), but besides the obvious external differences (integrated grnder) she was ""not allowed to disclose any internal/manufacturing difference because it's proprietary information"".
On my second attempt I didn't get through the recorded message ""due to the unusually high calls volume.... Call later"".

4803,4.0,2015-01-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have not written reviews before, but I have been a coffee, capucchino drinkers for years. Although I don't claim to be an expert in any sense of the word, I think that I am knowledgeable about making a good espresso and cappuchino. I read the 4 reviews that were posted on this machine prior to writing my own review, and I felt this machine deserved my review as well. Although this machine is not perfect and does require some trial and error over days/weeks, I think that it does a great job for the price and is well worth the investment!!!!!

I have had my machine for over a month now. I make 3-6 capuchino's a day for my wife and I. Compared to the Starbuck's espresso/capuchino barista machine we bought years ago, this machine is wonderful. We were inspired to buy it when we were in Puerto Rico and had a latte/capuchino at the airport with Latte art. Not only did we enjoy the art work, we realized how poor our old espresso/capuchino machine was.

Appearance

Although appearance and looks aren't everything - lol -, it is important. I personally think that this machine is gorgeous and looks great on my kitchen countertop. I love the stainless steel. I love the way it is laid out. I love the way the tamper is held. I love the way it looks when you turn it on and the lighting that it has. Everything is easy to access. If you need to put in water and its under a counter top, you just pull the machine out so you have room to refill it or turn it sidewise. I have absolutely no complaints about the layout of the machine. I think the design is fabulous.

Burr Grinder

On the good side, I must say that it is fabulous having a grinder on the machine that directly feeds grinds into the container that you make your espresso in. It makes making an excellent espresso so easy. The espresso/coffee also really does taste soooo much better when you are grinding beans immediately before you use them versus having them ground for days or weeks ahead of time. It is also sooo convenient not have a separate grinder, and it is such a nice system to have. I went into a local Starbuck's the other day, and they had a very similiar layout on the machine with the coffee beans in a conical plastic holder above the machine feeding into the grinder just like the Breville machine.

Personally, I cannot comment on the burr grinder and how well it does because I am not that knowledgeable. The grinds seem consistent and well done, and I have no complaints about the burr grinder's grinding.

On the negative side, I currently have the grinder grinding the minimal amount of coffee possible RYI, there is a range of settings on how much it should grind on the front of the machine. I have my setting on the most minimal coffee to grind, and I have the grind setting on a very fine grind. When the grinder is on its automatic function of grinding, it grinds an amount that slightly over flows the container that the coffee goes in and you lose some coffee. You would think when your grinder is set on the minimal amount of coffee grinds and a fine grind on top of that, it would deliver an amount that would not spill over the side and cause wastage of your coffee. I haven't dared to set the grinding amount at anything more than the minimal amount fearing it would just waste more coffee. The actual amount of ground coffee that is wasted is not much whatsoever, its the principal of automatic settings still wasting coffee grounds that bothers me. For your information, you can always control the amount that is being ground by manually starting and stopping the grinder by pushing the basket in and out, but I like to start the grinding, walk away from the machine, and not have to worry about it grinding slightly more than it should. Of course, once you tamp it down, you will probably have to grind a little bit more in order to have it at the right level so although its a minor inconvenience overall its absolutely great to have fresh ground coffee so easy to grind and put into the holder to brew great fresh espresso.

Making espresso shots

I have to admit, even after a month of using this machine, I still have to play with different factors to make great espresso. One of the things that I really love is the pressure gauge that works when you draw each and every shot. The pressure gauge helps you determine whether you have the right pressure each time you brew a shot to create a great shot. Without the pressure gauge, you would have absolutely no idea the pressures or barr being generated by the machine. Now I can look at every shot and know the pressure and whether it hit the right zone to make the perfect shot.

Generating the right pressure may be tricky at times. The pressure apparently depends on several things such as grind fineness,how much grinds you put in the basket, the bean type and other factors. You just have to play with these features to find the best combination for the perfect shot of espresso. I also think that each type of coffee bean that you use, the amount of time since the bean was roasted, and the age of when that coffee bean was roasted also plays a factor in terms of what grind you use and how much you have to pack or tamper the grinds.

Customer support

I have talked with customer support many times as I try to learn how to create a great espresso and great microfoam for capuchinos and latte art, and I must highly commend Breville for having a technical support line staffed with people really willing to help out. It is a major reason why I kept my machine and will keep it. Any company that cares about their products and their customers satisfaction with their products should model themselves after Brevilles customer service department. They are very friendly. They try to be very helpful, and I think generally they are very knowledgeable. Although at times, you can get frustrated with them because they really tell you that there are so many factors involved including the type of bean you are using, when it was roasted, how it was roasted and a myriad host of other factors. At first when I was in the learning stages, I actually went to whole foods grocery store as they will tell you and tried to buy the coffee that they recommend. Unfortunately, after making a trip there, I can tell you that the coffee they recommend apparently is unique to the California market, and they do not sell that type in any of their stores in Florida. The bottom line though is that I think the customer service department really makes a good effort to understand your needs and to get you to use the machine properly to produce the espresso and microfoam that you are after. Although I ended up not believing everything they told me and rightfully so, I think that most of their advice is very appropriate and helpful.

Microfoam

Microfoam is an art. I have been searching to perfect the technique over the last month, but its not necessarily easy. I think it can depend on the machine. I think that it can depend on the milk you use, and I think that it can depend on your technique and a combination of all these factors. Sometimes, I steam the milk (I usually use 2%) and the taste is absolutely devine, and I can't wait for the next cup. Other times, too much of the milk remains as heated milk rather than turn mostly into microfoam so I still feel that I am learning. Overall, when I do it correctly which is about 80% of the time, I am in heaven with my fresh espresso and microfoam, and the other 20% of the time, it is very good.

Ideally, I wanted to be able to do latte art with this machine. I have tried over and over and over to do it, but to be honest, I just can't get the microfoam or something write like they show you on the video's on youtube. I don't know if its the machine (remembering this is only a $599 machine versus the many many thousands of dollar machines at commercial places) or me, but I haven't been able to make my latte art ""hearts"" or other things well or consistently.

Overall, I really like this machine makes excellent espresso and microfoam with trial and error initially, and it is well worth the price. Use the customer service provided to help you learn about how to use this machine if you need help. I am sure that this Breville machine is not nearly as good as a commercial machine that cost megabuck or maybe even other models that only cost thousands, but for the asking price, I really don't think you can ask for much better, and I am really glad that I bought it. I hope this review helped.

PS The rating for this Breville machine price deserves a 5 star. I gave it a 4 star rating only because it seems that the people buying these machines are very, very particular and want the best even the price is nothing like you would pay for a commercial machine that would give them their ideal coffee."

4815,1.0,2014-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I have one and exchanged twice after 6 months something goes wrong, hate it."
4816,1.0,2014-12-07, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After having it for a little over a year, the grinder to this machine broke. Breville quoted $239 to fix it. I would have thought that for the price this machine would have been more reliable."
4817,5.0,2014-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the single best purchase made for our house. Both avid coffee drinkers, my husband started going out for coffee twice a day after drip coffee started giving him heartburn. Our monthly coffee bill was up to $270 a month. It is now reduced to about $70 a month. This machine will quickly pay for itself.

It’s a gorgeous machine. It’s thoughtfully designed and reliable. The instructions for use are clear and easy to follow. After about 2 days of use I had the technique down and am pleased to be drinking coffee that is far more delicious than anything I’ve had in town. As a former barista I have to say the crema is beautiful and I’m able to make perfect foam with the steam wand. My only regret is not buying this a long time ago.

I followed the recommendations from one of top reviews regarding the extras. The double walled glasses, knock box, and pack of 12 wash clothes for daily cleaning have proven to be very useful and worth purchasing. A friend recommended Cafe Umbria medium Italian espresso roast. It’s truly perfection!

I really can’t recommend this enough. The price tag made me delay purchasing this, but the math speaks for itself. We’re having better coffee and in 3 months we will be putting $200 extra dollars into our monthly budget. No brainer."
4818,5.0,2015-06-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We previously had a DeLonghi Magnifica that died, and this unit is better in pretty much every way. The layout and design is much more simple and well thought out, and the build quality is better.

Since it's a semi-automatic unit, the pressure gauge is helpful, although once you dial it in after a couple tries it's pretty fool proof.

The tool storage and removable drawer for clean up are super simple and nice, and overall it just works flawlessly.

I put a couple paper towels down to catch the extra grounds and just fold it up and throw it away when I'm done, then there is no clean up at all apart from a quick wipe to grab any extra moisture.

I make lattes and Americanos daily and love this machine."
4819,5.0,2015-02-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love the espresso pressure gauge. A machine without a EP gauge is in denial of the fact that it is as important as having the correct grind size, the amount of grind and the amount of force applied during the tamping step. Great espresso machines always has a pressure gauge. The built in grinder is just as good as the Breville Smart Grinder Pro for grinding espresso grinds. It is fully adjustable in fine increments on the outer burr itself in small increments. The programs are also great. The brew temp can be raised 2-4 degrees f. Water volume out put from the portafilter by time are adjustable on single cup and double cup. Milk frothing is also good. I use a thermometer to control the milk temperature. I wish it had a milk temperature sensor gauge during frothing, but the price of the machine could have been more by around a hundred dollars. I highly recommended this brewer. The Breville Infuser is similar to the Barista Express without the grinder. If you buy a Smart Por grinder along with the Infuser, the whole package would cost over $ 300.00 more than the Barista Express. Believe me, I considered going that route before getting the Barista Express. BTW, I purchased a Barista Pro a couple of weeks before I switched to Barista Express. I returned the Barista Pro to Amazon due several issues and it took me awhile to conclude that it was not me, it's the machine that's defective. I'm so happy that I stuck with Breville and chose the Barista Express. This must be the world's best seller espresso machine. Buy it.
Update:
In my honest opinion, the built-in grinder is a very inferior grinder like the Smart Pro. It is very hard to clean and gets loaded up very quickly with sticky flaky ground coffee and retention is a problem, but it will have to do for now. I am debating between a Sette 30 or a Eureka Mignon grinder as the main grinder in a few weeks after the 30 day return expires."
4820,5.0,2021-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Having owned several espresso machines, including Lapavoni's, Pasquini, and a commercial La Cimbali, I am very impressed by this little machine. The grinder is nice, and easily dialed in for a great pull, the steam power more than. Adequate, and the shot quality fantastic with good beans. I've had it for a few days and am impressed. Is it a commercial machine? No. Does it have the consistency and steam power of a double boiler system? No. Nonetheless, I think it's a great little home machine that will hopefully provide years of enjoyment, and doesn't take up nearly the counter space that my La Cimbali and grinder did. If your looking for tips on making great espresso with this machine, there are lots of good tips in other reviews, and not much more to add. Good, fresh beans give you a chance of pulling a great shot. Old stale beans or store bought beans that have set on a shelf for months will always disappoint, even with the best of technique. Prewarm your filter head and cups, dial in your grind, and pull a few test shots. Give the machine a minute or two to catch up between pulling shots or steaming (again it's not a double boiler system). I use filtered water, not water directly out of the tap to reduce scale and buildup in the boiler. Have fun, try lots of different beans, and enjoy the process of learning and experimenting."
4821,5.0,2017-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My girlfriend is a barista, and i've always wanted to learn how to pour those beautiful lattes that she does. She recommended this machine after lengthy research, and we ended up splitting the cost so we could both have great coffee whenever we want. It makes a better cup of coffee than the $14,000 Italian machine she uses at work!! I'm blown away! Lets get right into the pro's and con's here..

PROS

Easy set up

Instruction booklet is clear and precise. Lots of information

Grinder works perfectly, and settings are precise

Steams milk quickly

Haven't had a less than perfect espresso extraction yet

Measures shots perfectly

Super easy clean up

Takes VERY little time for components to heat up

So many positives i can't list them all!

CONS
It's a little messy, but what espresso machine isn't.

The portafilter could be a little larger. It's very sturdy, don't get me wrong, but i have large hands and i feel like it's a childs play thing. I also feel like there's a bit too much over spill with the grind since the portafilter is a bit small. Again, this is just me, not an issue with the machine.

I wish the tip of the steam wand was a bit larger and had more holes. It works fine, but it was hard to dial in exactly where it needed to be for that perfect microfoam.

Only reason it got 4 stars for the ""easy to use"" section is because no espresso machine is quite easy. It takes a while to craft the skills to make a perfect latte, so to say that it's easy would be a lie. Ergonomically there are a few things that I would change, but thats just me. I can learn to work around the machine.

Price. In order to get a descent machine you gotta dump some money into it. Is it worth it? Yes, but dumping 700 bucks into anything always makes me cringe. I feel the market demand dictates the price, so not the machines fault.

All the cons are trivial. If you have the money, and want a really great home espresso machine, this is the one you want. Don't even look at any others, I promise you'll be happy. Check my reviews. I literally NEVER write them. This time, I felt I'd be doing the world a disservice by not raving about how awesome this machine is."
4822,5.0,2015-05-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I am not an expert in making espresso but I have tried a couple of cheaper machines and came to the conclusion that if you want to get into making espresso you need the right tool. Making espresso is like a craft you want to master. To get good at it you need a machine that can give you the right pressure and temperature for the water and allows you to make modifications so you can fine tune the espresso taste. This machine does all of that at a reasonable price.
The $600 price tag may not be what some want to spend on a coffee machine but for the ones who are serious about the taste of coffee it's well worth it. Sure you can find cheaper models like I did before this but they are usually not much of an improvement over a drip coffee maker so I ended up returning them. There are also the pod systems that are very simple to use and are perfect if you just want to get the jitter juice and rush out the door in the morning but those don't have the flexibility and the pods are kind of expensive.
This machine is good if you want to explore different possibilities of making your coffee. You can entertain your guests with your new skills in making cappuccinos, lattes, etc. There are tons of youtube videos that would get you started on how to make different coffee drinks.
I'd highly recommend this for any skill level."
4823,4.0,2020-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Minor opinion
1) Don't know why some water come from the back trap, not sure is it the steam.
2) Don't know why the low level water indicator marked to low, it would be better if it can give me some allowance.
3) After extracted the coffee, it need sometime to ensure the boiler is enough water to let the steam continuing to run, Otherwise, it will no steam when pouring the milk.
4) If you continuing to make more coffee, say 4 cup, the last one will over heat. That means the temperature is higher than the first one, as a result the coffee will have a little bitter than the first cup. I think the machine need to cool down a moment after made a 3 cup of coffee.
5) I saw the youtube, the package is including the cleaning plastic pad which set on the portafilter when regular clean. But my new machine not included, don't why?

Other than the above minor opinion, it is more than my expectation."
4824,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This espresso machine is absolutely worth the money! For any “in-betweens” like me (you know quite a bit about coffee, but not enough to be called an expert) this espresso machine, like many others, is definitely not the type to do everything for you. This is where your love for crafting coffee and work of art kicks in!

- The pamphlet provided tells you everything you need to know about this espresso machine, and even better, it also gives you easy rundowns on basic espresso knowledge such as how long an espresso should be ideally extracted, the taste quality, etc. Which is why I say that this is a perfect starting machine for those who have no experience with Crafting espresso.

- It is tedious (but fun) work, so if you’re looking for a machine that will fully craft a full cup of coffee for you, this isn’t the machine. Enjoy the fruit of your labor!

- Definitely easy to clean, and they provide some cleaning tools and tablets for you to last you for awhile. I use my espresso machine at least 4 times a week (I’ve had this for over 2 months) and the cleaning light hasn’t turned on for me yet. (Note: I also clean as I go, which I think helps maintain the quality and life of the machine) Other than that, the tray is easy to clean!

- Space, space, space. Although this machine is small and fits perfect on a kitchen counter, you still need some counter space for all of your items such as your tamper (if you bought a separate one), milk jugs, shot glasses, etc. You need arm space for sure, just like when you need space for cooking!

- I’ve worked with top-notch expensive espresso bars, and if you’ve worked with them too at coffee shops then you’d know that those bigger espresso machines are actually pretty quiet compared to this little machine, which I wasn’t expecting. The Breville isn’t overpoweringly loud so I don’t mind, but just take note of it if you decide to make coffee when people in the household are still sleeping lol

- Have patience. It’s a work in progress. Getting to know the machine, how it works, and also using its tools will take some time (at least for me it did) in order to achieve the good tasting coffee you want. It took me awhile to get the hang of it all.

Other than that, I definitely recommend this espresso machine! I’ve saved so much money by investing in this machine, I don’t have to keep going to coffee shops as frequent anymore"
4825,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This machine is amazing! I watched a bunch of videos and made sure to buy all the necessary items for me to get started and I love it! A good bean makes all the difference so make sure to try out different beans! I bought a calibrated tamper and a larger milk frothing mug so I can make my mochas large. Not only will my machine save me money over time, I make a much better mocha than that popular coffee shop. I don't forget to add the espresso, don't forget to add the chocolate and the temp is always perfect. I've never been a Batista, but a couple of videos and I feel like one now! I thought it would take a lot more practice and throwing out tons of practice shots, but the videos were so awesome that my second shot was perfect. Plan to take the time to rinse your porta filter, your milk frother and your shot glass. I rinse my drip tray out daily too. It's just so incredibly easy and delicious!"
4826,5.0,2022-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Easy to use, comes with a quick guide. I used a kerig before so...........if I can do it, you can too. Just read the guide, simple, on the back is troubleshooting methods. Haven't had to use it so far, because its simple and I bought regular coffee(from a coffee shop I love though) set it up in the automatic grinder. Simple, simple, so easy. Saved me 32 bucks so far, plus gas, and time. I just use simple Hershey syrup (the 5 ingredient one at publix) and oatmilk for my base and I use the double setting for like 16 oz and i would use single for 8 oz. Done and done. Easy to clean afterwards, obviously all water that come out of here is HOT. So be CAREFUL."
4827,5.0,2018-05-19, Brushed Stainless Steel," Well, I love it. I've never made my own espresso until I bought this about a month ago. My coffee experience is amazing. My dad always says he'll pay me to make him a mocha. The machine can be a little loud. Turning on and steaming the milk. Can't make a coffee when my daughter is napping lol (medium sized apartment)
I love that it has its own grinder. I love the tamper holder to the left. I also use the ""tea"" (hot water) setting to make my daughter a bottle. I believe the hot water comes out at 150°. I bought a bunch of paper cups, a double insulated glass espresso catcher, and a temperature gauge. On average I make 2 espressos a day so in about 17 weeks it'll pay itself off."
4828,5.0,2020-06-19, Black Sesame,"I love my Breville Barista Express!! Having this machine feels like having my own personal cafe in my home, with delicious espressos and lattes at my fingertips. As a previous professional barista, this machine was super easy to figure out - though I definitely made a lot of espresso before coming to my personal favorite grind/pull settings. Overall, and absolutely worth-it investment."
4829,5.0,2015-05-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I've had this espresso machine for 5 years. I've also owned 4 previous machines cheaper machines before this one. This machine is amazing. If you just make sure to keep it filled with coffee and water as well ""cleaning"" when it tells you, it'll be worth the investment. I use this machine every day and when I'm on vacation I miss it. I genuinely prefer what I can make at home to most coffee places. I love the pressure gauge, it helped me improve even though I already knew how to make espresso (I briefly worked at Starbucks).

I recommend an evacuated stainless steel coffee cup so you can take some with you when needed. I personally skip the steam wand most days because using it takes much longer than the microwave before work. I've taken to making my own caramel and white chocolate sauces to try in this when I'm feeling a ""fancier"" drink. I'll make iced lattes in the summer, hot throughout the rest off the year. I'm thinking that I eventually want to upgrade to a manual machine, but I will not get another automatic or even a super automatics, this one is perfect."
4830,5.0,2015-11-27, Black Sesame,"For me, a pure espresso is always the way to recognize the quality of a coffee shop or coffee beans which you can rarely feel under a layer of milk. I was surprised to get a pretty good cup of espresso from a regular Lavazza jar that I occasionally had left. And if you use crafted beans and follow the technology then you'll never go to any coffee shop again. The pressure, the temperature (I set +2F to the standard temp), the volume are almost perfect right out of the box. Whenever I make a regular cappuccino or a keto-latte - the espresso makes them perfect. I just needed a couple of times to get used to the steamer and now feel like a real barista. Very happy considering the price and a friend of mine has had it for a couple of years with no troubles.
p.s. the quality of the machine, the way it was packed, the tools - I was so pleasantly surprised. My old fully automatic 1K+ DeLonghi I had a few years ago felt much cheaper."
4831,5.0,2019-04-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So glad i bought this. While the machine was being shipped to me I started reading the negative reviews. I was shocked to see so many negative experiences. Once the machine arrived I made sure I kept the box in case I had to send it back. I can tell you one thing, I’ve had zero issues with my machine and it’s one of the best purchases I’ve ever made in my life. I know someone that had theirs for 10 years. This machine is the perfect middle ground. It’s not overly complicated yet offers more than enough for my uses. Overall I highly recommend this item."
4832,5.0,2020-05-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Dear Lord Jesus, do not let this espresso machine break. I have become addicted to how frothy and strong this espresso is outta this machine. Really do not seeing going back to regular coffee. I had a smaller Breville espresso machine but kiddo moved out to her own place. She begged me for my Breville. Well... time for an upgrade! There are a bunch of tutorials out there on this model...listen to them so you actually make a great espresso. There are more expensive options and cheaper Brevilles as well. This one was right in the middle for us. I did my research on all the different models. If you cannot sleep, research espresso machines. You will be up all night. I am Average Jane. If I am using this product, so is every single person in my city."
4833,5.0,2016-01-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took me a good two weeks of this sitting in my shopping cart, and researching as to whether or not I should purchase. Well, that's two whole weeks that I missed on not having amazing drinks. I am SO glad I made this purchase. I set up a fun coffee bar at my home, complete with many syrups and recipe cards so that when our guests come, or lets me honest, so when afternoon coffee calls, I have everything I need!! Love this so much!!"
4834,5.0,2015-08-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you want a quick, easy, espresso maker, get something else. If you want an authentic experience, to make the best possible espresso, this is the machine for you. Ignore YouTubers, the grinder works great. The steam wand does take a bit of time to get right. We use it everyday and loves it. Also, keep the pressure cups. If you're in rush, they guarantee a good cup without muss and fuss. Overall, this machine is fantastic."
4835,5.0,2020-04-19, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is a fantastic machine. I read in prior reviews where some people complained that the grinder for the coffee beans stopped working. Overfilling the hopper will you keep the beans will cause the machine to jam. It's very easy to fix. The machine has worked perfectly. Prior to buying it I calculated how much I was spending on Starbucks. On one cup a day I was spending $1,500 a year. At $700 that math just makes sense. This is a high quality stainless machine that should last a long time. I'm delighted with the purchase and it's not hard to figure out how to use. I would recommend that you watch videos if you plan to purchase the machine. There's an abundance of free videos. Good luck!"
4836,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We bought this as a gift for our son ( a Nurse) who loves a good cup when he gets off of his Frontline shift. A coffee nut, he loves this machine. Took awhile to get it right, but with practice, he was able to make the 'perfect' cup. It is good to see his smile."
4837,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I was not sure at first when I got this out of the box but really looks like a champ. It seemed a bit confusing as first but after watching a few Youtube videos we have found how easy this machine is to use. The coffee has been top notch. I would check out some of the reviews; one in particular provides extensive information and product use tips.
4838,5.0,2017-11-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,Well it took some getting used to but when I choose the right filter I got pressure and my experience was the closest to being in heaven because i live for coffee!!!!
4839,1.0,2016-06-03, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The grinder Stopped working after 2 weeks! Not clogged, Dead switch!! Poor quality and poor repair quality!! Very poor design!"
4840,5.0,2020-03-30, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My friend recommended this machine and I also researched a bit. This is absolutely a great buy. I used to be a black coffee guy, but now love latte hot or iced. You cannot buy a better espresso machine with similar price tag. The only con is you will hate the cheap coffee in office LOL!"
4841,5.0,2018-07-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,Love this machine! After a Month long trip to Europe when we came back we couldn’t do the swill that the Kurig brews. We had to switch to get that quality cup we got used to. This machine is for the coffee connoisseur and not for someone that just wants basic Folgers coffee.
4842,5.0,2015-05-10, Black Sesame,This is so easy to use even for a beginner like me. I watched some YouTube videos of people making iced coffee with this machine. Bye bye Starbucks and Dutch Bros my coffee tastes just as good or even better with this machine! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
4843,5.0,2015-08-27, Black Sesame,"Omg it’s sooooo nice, it’s absolutely perfect I have not been back to Starbucks since I have my own espresso machine at home now😍(saving tons of money)😎 it is the perfect size, it looks big in the picture but it’s really not huge at all it’s perfect for your countertop I highly suggest you pay the money for a good no no GREAT product❤️❤️"
4844,5.0,2015-08-26, Brushed Stainless Steel,This thing has gotten daily use ever since it was purchased and it is durable and does what you need it to - make great coffee drinks. Very happy with it as it is used by a former barista at Starbucks and keeps her happy so what more can I say?
4845,5.0,2020-09-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best purchase I have ever made! So far so good. Everything seems to be working properly. Came with clear instructions and everything you need to keep it nice and clean. Makes some really amazing coffee drinks and overall is just a really nice looking and performing machine.
4846,5.0,2015-10-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I was really worried about using this, what with the grind and the single and double options, however, I overcame my fears and have been using this machine everyday. I haven't used the milk steamer because I heard it's hard to clean.
Great cup of espresso evreytime!"
4847,5.0,2015-12-25, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Works extremely well ... once you figure out how to use. Not user friendly out of the box. You need to watch several YouTube videos to know how to use it correctly. Overall, great product."
4848,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Amazing product. Makes great coffee, solidly built, a great investment. Only negative is that the various filters are hard to change so it is impractical to change between sizes of shots or to drip (not sure why you would use this for basic preground). We just leave the double shot filter in all the time."
4849,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After not being able to get favorite coffee drinks for 2 months due to COVID-19 closings, finally splurged on this espresso machine. It's my first ever and its very easy to use and clean. I am able to make amazing espressos, americanos, cappuccinos and lattes. Not missing going out for coffee any longer."
4850,4.0,2015-07-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’ve been kicking around buying this machine for a couple years. I’m glad I finally did.
In order to operate this machine You need to read the instructions and perhaps watch some how-to videos.
I think a good portion of the negative reviews is just a lack of understanding about how it works"
4851,5.0,2017-05-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,We've had this over a month and really like it we only use the double wall cup for brewing and it works great we usually four cups a day very convenient and saves money and time
4852,5.0,2014-09-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Paying this price will pay off in the long run. You want quality then expect to pay that price, but enjoy what it produces ! We did purchase an Extended Warranty just for peace-of-mind."
4853,5.0,2015-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,I like this machine but returned it for the Pro. Definitely worth the upgrade cost. I don't suggest buying this machine unless you find it >30% off.
4854,5.0,2021-01-27, Black Sesame,Perfection. Buy it.
4855,5.0,2014-11-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,I freaking love this espresso machine! Ive had it for about 2 months and I use it every day. Tooks a few tries to get the hang of it but Im in love.
4856,5.0,2019-02-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,Best investment I've made. The grinder allows you to choose to coursness of your grounds and strength of coffee. Does time time to dial in and your bean choice is essential
4857,5.0,2019-05-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love this so much, we bought another one! Life changer indeed. Starbucks is such a waste of money. This is so awesome and simple to use."
4858,5.0,2020-04-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love my Brevilles. This is the 3rd one I’ve owned. They usually go for about 4-5 years without problems.
4859,5.0,2015-07-29, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Haven’t gone back to a coffee shop since… except to restock on beans lol

But really, I love this machine! Makes great espresso! If you’re on edge about whether or not to make the purchase, just pull the trigger already! It exceeds expectations! Nespresso who? Lol"
4860,5.0,2018-01-27, Black Sesame,I am so happy that finally I bought this coffee machine. It is perfect to make a latte. I must say that I did a really good decision to buy it. Great taste and beautiful shape!
4861,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"very satisfied with this espresso maker, I used to have a completely manual one way back and it was a hassle, the semiautomatic features of this one are intuitive and provides making espresso-based drinks a snap - this should be priced around 200 less, but if the difference is because of reliability (which I’m along way of) then it’s completely worth it"
4862,5.0,2015-01-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Have had this for 5 years now and is a workhorse. Love this machine!
4863,4.0,2015-01-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"nice product but all grind degrees are the same on this product. there are no any grind degree, it grind only too small, you need to buy grinder if you buy this product."
4864,1.0,2020-02-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"The grinder is not working.. Doesnt build pressure to brew the coffe. Missing the milk cup, and other items."
4865,5.0,2015-04-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Delicious brews with many options for various preferred tastes! With practice one can have fresh espresso in their own home whenever desired. The Breville machine offers purge (self cleaning) functions. Grind adjustment dial for various bean density’s.
Overall this machine is great for espresso enthusiasts who are interested in expanding their barista horizon!"
4866,5.0,2015-10-10, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Our son wanted this for Christmas, when we asked him. We obliged because we trust Breville products. Our son loves it."
4867,5.0,2015-04-02, Black Sesame,"Don't need to spend money at Starbucks anymore. In fact, no need to leave my home. This machine is the best!"
4868,5.0,2015-07-08, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Got a great price on this machine, Love making my americano’s at home."
4869,5.0,2022-02-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,What a great machine for anybody who loves extracting an espresso. This is an amazing machine
4870,5.0,2015-06-24, Brushed Stainless Steel,You’ll never be able to go back to the coffee pot or Keurig.
4871,5.0,2017-10-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"fresh coffee fast, pays for itself in time saved waiting in line."
4872,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Its my first time using espresso machine and this is easy to use for beginner like me..
4873,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,Great product.
4874,5.0,2014-12-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"A little difficult to learn to use, but once mastered it make very good expresso drinks"

4888,5.0,2015-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"So.... I have use this machine since I purchased it in October. I am so happy that I purchased this.I haven’t been to a coffee shop sense an even been able to indulge in 2 cups a day every so often.

There’s a gentleman on here who left a very lengthy review and some tips. He’s not really wrong. I don’t use syrups and any of my espresso’s. I typically just have espresso and cream better known as breve. Once you have the hang of this machine down which only takes a few cups it will pour consistently.

The dial on the side that determines the size of your grounds I like to keep you there in three or four. Anything higher and the water goes through too quickly (I think learning curve here for an hour). Somebody had accidentally bumped it about two weeks in and it took me about an hour to figure out what they have done.

I typically keep it on the double filter. You can stop the grind midway and straighten out the grounds in the hopper. I typically do that and then finish grinding some more beans on top of that. If you don’t wanna watch it use the single and your grounds won’t go over. I don’t like mess so I would rather stop the grinding of coffee beans midway through and straighten them up then to have coffee grounds all over my counter.

The other reviewer I spoke of recommended getting a pack of 10 washcloths to keep next to your machine. For cleaning purposes I absolutely recommend this. As you are steaming your cream or milk what down one of those wash cloths And keep it handy for when you need to clean the steam wand off. When you’re all finished you can wipe everything up and let it dry in your sink.

Some people recommended purchasing a knock box for the grounds. I thought about doing it however my trashcan is stainless steel and as long as you don’t slam the hopper down on the side of the trashcan the grounds fall off with a few tabs and I have not had need of a knock box.

I have only used spring water in this machine. Having hard water I have seen in the past how many coffee pots I have gone through. Typically in my home I need to replace a coffee maker every 2 to 3 years. This is too expensive. So I have opted to use spring water only. That being said, I have not had any build up in the water container or inside the machine the last time I cleaned it.

There are two tablets that come with the machine to clean. I recommend watching the YouTube video so you don’t screw up the first tablet. I did. The directions in the box for this machine are clear but also not so clear when it comes to those little tablets. You can get a new box of 12 on Amazon. Use those about every other month or until that little light comes on that tells you to clean it.

Do you read the directions through a couple times before setting up your machine. It was one of the recommendations I took from someone else and I am passing along. It was very easy to set up once you read through the booklet once or twice and the booklet is not that long it’s only a couple pages. From out-of-the-box reading the book twice and setting up the machine I had everything up and going within 10 minutes. I had the 1st cup of coffee approximately five minutes after that. Dialed in and within a half hour I had perfect espresso.

I read from another reviewer that if you let your machine warm up for at least 20 to 40 minutes you get better espresso. I don’t believe they’re lying. Don’t get me wrong the expression you get from the moment you turn on the machine is still very good but I think it is better when you’ve had the machine warm up for a while. Also you get the added perk of sit in your cup on top and getting it hot. In the winter after I get home from work that is an added little perk that keeps my coffee a little hotter while I change my clothes after I’ve made it and put on my sweatpants.

This machine is a expensive put out. However I do believe within a month I made back nearly all of the money I would’ve spent going to the coffee shop on this machine. My house figured out we were spending approximately $100-$150 each month between all of us. None of us have been to a coffee shop sense. The organic beans you can get at target our wonderful. I also have tried other organic espresso beans from Whole Foods and earth fare without any issues. This machine more than paid for itself by the end of the second month.

So far the machine has been making approximately 4 to 6 cups a day double shots. And we’ve had no problems with it working. It starts when it supposed to. It makes coffee when it supposed to. We have kept it clean the grinder is maybe my only complaint. Sometimes the beans won’t fall and you will have to takeoff the lid and just move them around a little bit but since you’re standing there steaming milk it doesn’t really bother me to do that.

I know this is been a long review but I Hope it helps someone. I put in about four months of thought and research before I decided on this machine. I have thought about getting more expensive machines however they were still outside my price point and we wanted to get something in the house that would decrease our $400/500 a month Have it at the coffee shops without having to wait months for saving. I ended up able to get this on sale so instead of paying the 699 I was able to pay 599 and free shipping and we took the plunge. We have not regretted it and I don’t believe anybody else will either.

I am in agreement with the other reviewer that said if something ever happened to his house and he had to re-purchase appliances this would be one of the first purchases to be made. There is no way I would go without one if I had to re-purchase appliances."
4889,5.0,2020-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Love it! Purchased as a housewarming gift but I got to use it at their house. They use it daily so it's been a great gift. Dialing in the bean grind/amount, figuring out which basket to use, and what button does what takes a bit of time to figure out. The only complaint is that this makes a mess and I feel it wastes a lot of coffee when the grinder fills the puck/basket/handle thing. Espresso is great and it makes a nice foam but I'm not an expert."
4890,5.0,2016-10-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine. We bought it at the beginning of the lockdown and I haven’t missed the coffee shop one bit! This thing is amazing, the grinder works great, it makes perfect espresso and the milk steamer is strong and works perfectly. There is nothing I would change about it. I’ve been using it every day straight for 8 months and it’s still going strong."
4891,4.0,2021-11-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,"this machine makes good espresso, however, you may need buy separate grinder to make perfect espresso.

The built-in grinder does not works for me. Even with top burr 1, grinder setting 'fine', on some dark roast I still cannot get a good extraction (pressure not high enough).
Also, coffee retention in grinder is high and not good for single dosing. After deep cleaning of the grinder, I tested with 18g bean, the grinder only grind out 15g coffee, after run the grinder until no coffee out, so there is at least 3g retention in the grinder."
4892,1.0,2015-01-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,Bought it in May of 2020 and it wasn’t working properly and we thought maybe we are not used to it give it couple of weeks and called them they sent a replacement after a week of using the new one coffee grinder stopped working! I would not buy it again.

4894,5.0,2015-01-04, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Brought as a gift to an expresso afficiando to replace their dead lavassio machine, they love it! They’ve used it just about daily for about half a year now. Shipping was timely and machine was delivered in perfect condition. Grinds the beans fresh and is easy to use."
4895,1.0,2014-12-31, Brushed Stainless Steel,Awful product
4896,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Make great lattes at home!
4897,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took a few days to wait for the coffee machine. When I saw Amazon deliver it, I was excited to go home and start the trial. Every detail in the process of use needs to be carefully studied, and the grinding thickness of the coffee beans needs to be adjusted, including the choice of beans, and then the milk froth system has not been thoroughly studied, and no good milk froth has been produced, so continue to study. Isn't the fun of choosing an espresso machine here? Constantly learning new skills to become a coffee expert, I can’t wait to try the new coffee ideas I created myself."

4901,5.0,2015-03-20, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Don’t be intimidated by some of the reviews. The unit is not hard to use. Read the manual, watch a few YouTube videos and buy good beans. Worked for me first time and the cappuccino was great. If you like good coffee, buy it and enjoy."
4902,5.0,2014-08-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,We are just figuring out how to make our own espresso and this machine is fairly straightforward and easy to use. Makes delicious hot espresso and the milk frother is wonderful as is the grinder.
4903,5.0,2019-10-21, Brushed Stainless Steel,We love our Breville! Takes a little time to get it dialed in making drinks how you want buts that’s all part of the process. Highly recommend it!

4906,5.0,2019-08-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,This espresso machine was such a great investment & so glad we bought the one with a grinder attached! Easy to use and have make so many delicious lattes!
4907,5.0,2019-12-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"It took a few attempts to fine-tune the grind, etc. After that, smooth sailing, with excellent flavored espresso. Well worth the money if you drink espresso every day."
4908,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Got this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a prettt big coffee fan. He has always wanted an espresso maker but never wanted any of the cheaper ones. I bought this as a gift for him and he LOVES it. The noise level of the machine isn’t unbearable and you can’t hear it from outside our apartment. I don’t know much about coffee itself but I know he loves it!
4909,4.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is an amazing machine. The only problem I'm having is getting the settings just right when grinding beans. I can't seem to get the pressure right. The one thing that I have done to get around this issue is by buying expresso already ground. Once I started doing that the pressure is right in the middle and I get good crema every time.

 The Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine is a perfect machine that does it all, it grinds the beans, makes perfect espressos and froths the milk! Such a good quality machine that produces delicious coffees, what else can you ask for??!"
4911,5.0,2014-10-06, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I researched espresso machines for days. All the articles and reviews kept pointing to this machine being the #1 out there. Now I’m no fancy espresso drinker but want to get into making my own lattes instead of paying the bux $10 for one each time. So I pulled the trigger and let me tell ya folks, SHES WORTH ITTTTTT. Watched a bunch of videos, pretty much if you’re a beginner/average coffee drinker, leave all the settings as is. Don’t mess with that stuff. Just buy some good beans, grind em, drink the thing. Absolutely delish. Can’t recommend enough. Very fun playing with syrups and using my cocktail shaker to make some unreal drinks. Watch out fall I’m gunna have PSL’s coming out like hot cakes. Did you know more than 4 cups of coffee you can talk to electricity?! YEEHAW"
4912,5.0,2021-01-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is our third one. Our 2 previous ones lasted about 5 or 6 years each. Given how much 3 people used this machine daily, we are very pleased. It saves us money because we don’t have to go to a coffee shop to enjoy excellent coffee, espresso or lattes. We can enjoy to our hearts content from the comfort of our home. I’m thinking they must have improved since our last one because the grinder seems more quiet with our newest machine, although it looks identical. In any event, we’ll be lifelong customers so long as they keep making this machine!"
4913,5.0,2018-03-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine I should have bought it sooner. It is easy to use clean and the aroma of fresh ground espresso is the best
4914,5.0,2014-12-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you are patient to learn the features, this is a great machine for perfect italian espresso with extra fine crema and cappucino with perfect microfoam."
4915,5.0,2021-12-01, Brushed Stainless Steel,"This is the third time I’ve purchased this machine. The first time I got it I wasn’t very keen on cleaning it and scaling it every so often so It broke down fairly quickly. My bad. The second time around I was a lot more conscientious and the machine lasted me for three years as I kept cleaning it religiously. Unfortunately after nearly three years I couldn’t brew any more coffee as there was very little water coming out of the portafilter. I could steam milk just fine, but I couldn’t get a lot of hot water out or make coffees anymore. I was told that either the boiler was going bust or some of the valves had gone bad. Either way, I decided to order a new double boiler delonghi which was more expensive but turned out to dissatisfy me more. Returned it and replaced it yet again with a bréville barista express which (although it has a single boiler and makes slightly more noise) is a most reliable machine. I’ve had the most incredible lattes in my life. So convenient so easy making three or four coffees a day. So go ahead and make that purchase. It is an extremely reliable machine and I’ve never been happier. Besides, if I were to get Starbucks 3 times a day within 2 months or so I’ll make your money back. It’s so worth it!"

4919,5.0,2014-11-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I no longer have to pay for what is now $8 at a chain coffee shop. We can make it at home cheaper and it tastes like it came from the store. I don’t have to pay extra for a second espresso shot anymore! Highly recommend this!!
4920,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,I’ve been using this espresso machine for some time now and it’s really good and durable. Even though some parts are plastic they don’t feel cheap at all. The machine does exactly what it’s supposed to do and haven’t had any issues so far. The only drawback for me would be the noise - it’s not exactly silent when making espresso or frothing the milk.
4921,5.0,2017-06-16, Black Sesame,"The only complain one can make is the size of the machine. It looks a little bit big in our quite small kitchen. But this coffee machine is just great !
All the accessorizes you need are included.
It warms very fast (the new barista pro is supposed to be even faster, but seriously, I don't see the point ! time to grind your coffee, the machine is already ready !)"

4924,5.0,2017-12-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love my breville barista, as no other restaurant can duplicate my coffee experience.

I pick fresh peppermint from my garden (1-2 stalks), and grind them in my mortar & pestle. I then, pour high ph water over the peppermint.

While the peppermint tea (fabulous for digestion) is steeping I prepare my shoes for my husband and I, pour the tea over the shots.

Then, I pour 2 tbsp of cinnamon in my milk and Froth it. I add cinnamon powder atop and call it Macaroni.

It is amazing!

I learned to clean the water system, use high ph water, tamp, time the tea and coffee combo, change the filters and keep the tray and frother clean and love the experience.

P.S. Find the milk you like to froth. The best was oatly, but didn't suit us, so we use Elmhurst or Almond Breeze.

Find your Grove and enjoy."
4925,5.0,2018-10-06, Black Sesame,"Finally bought one, been using this model at my families places for past few years. Just got one and it's great.

We did have a vapor lock issue when we first started it up. It's due to it heating up too much when you first prime the pump and lines. We let it cool down overnight and started it up in the morning, worked after that. I have a hunch it's the reservoir filter causing too much of a flow restriction when first priming the system. Anyways, if you encounter this issue don't freak out and just let it cool down and try again once cool.

Looking forward to being over-caffeinated with y'all. Cheers."
4926,5.0,2015-06-17, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I absolutely love this machine. I read a lot of reviews a did a fair amount of research before purchasing this one and am very thankful for some info I found on youtube. I initially stayed with the factory settings and couldn't get any pressure through the machine. I found a video on youtube by Ayu's Cafe which taught me how to change the internal burr setting. I also turned the grind setting way down. My machine ending up working best with both of the settings on 3. Once that was handle, I couldn't be happier. I followed ""Hoon's Coffee"" (also found on yotube) method when it came to switching my grind settings. His advice was to start the grind process and then change the setting down, otherwise beans could get stuck and your machine wouldn't fully slide into the lower setting. Very easy process in the morning now. I love that I can grind, pour and steam all in one."
4927,5.0,2018-10-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,Well worth the investment. I make six shots every 🌅 for several years I try to routinely clean it sometimes it might go a few months without descaling. I use good carbon filters and bottled water you will get great life out of this machine and stays consistent since day one absolutely recommend. I make six shots of espresso every morning along with froth milk. Also recommend vacuuming out grinder chamber excessive crowding build up from grinding beans especially dry beans.

4943,5.0,2014-03-31, Black Sesame,"Ok, first off this is a beautiful machine. It looks great just sitting there on the counter. I have had several different machines and have worked at a coffee house. I followed the directions and could not get the espresso to come out properly. I ended up doing a video chat with Breville and they helped me fine tune the process. The rep advised me that what he did was set the grind amount to the lowest setting. Then use the auto grind a couple of times to get just the right amount of grounds. Before it kept grinding too much and spilling all over. Also, even though I was grinding my beans with the machine, he had me use the filter basket for pre-ground coffee instead of the one that came in the portafiller. All those changes allowed me to brew perfect espresso. If you are having problems getting it just right I would recommend you do a chat with an expert!"
4944,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,Read the instructions and not the negative reviews (most negatives are a result of not following directions) and you will soon be enjoying a fantastic espresso or latte.

I'm contacting Breville to see about getting it replaced. I have several other Breville appliances including the ice cream maker and the panani maker. I had the Quick touch crisp microwave but it failed after one month, I was given a full refund and was told to throw this expensive microwave in the trash. One common denominator in all these machines is China. It's becoming quite apparent that many products made in China are sub par and of questionable reliability."

Having years of experience learning how to craft that perfect shot, I did not need to tweek and calibrate this machine to get that $5 cup of Starbucks coffee. 😍 my only regret here is not purchasing this sooner. I rarely write Amazon reviews but felt I needed to do my due diligence to tell the world, and those on the fence, about this large purchase that it is entirely worth it.

Before, I prepared a latte/cappuccino each morning with a Moka pot. In the past, I have used an espresso machine. No varying results. I was like a blind man walking. I didn't know what was around me. When you've been drinking toilet water all your life and then you try chablis, it's a different world. Got the point right. This machine helps you prepare error-free espresso. The best thing is it tells you exactly, based on a pressure gauge if you espresso is under or over-extracted. Once you get the settings you like, it's automatic everytime."

It had all the parts packed away like expected and nothing looked as if it had been touched.

It was pretty easy to use right out of the box. After the initial cleaning, I made a cup just to see how it would work. I missed quite a few things (having now read the manual) but that first cup was still way better than any other coffee I've made at home! I can't wait to see what it will taste like when I actually follow all the steps correctly!"
4959,1.0,2019-02-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love their machines but this one broke after 3 mths. Unfortunately I bought it while I was out if the country for 2 mths and it sat in a box
4960,5.0,2020-06-15, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We've been making our coffee with this for 2 weeks, the initial cost of this was a bit much but it will pay for itself in a month. We went from spending $14 a day buying our latte's to brewing our own for much less and with a better taste."
4961,5.0,2019-01-25, Black Sesame,Bought these for my kids for Christmas. They LOVE it! They work from home and look forward to their morning coffee! Especially since they don’t have to leave the house to get excellent coffee!
4962,5.0,2019-05-25, Black Sesame,"Great build quality - impressive manual as well. I was able to pull a perfect shot at my first go itself. Hands-down love the ease of use. I am never paying for good coffee again.

Update after using for 9 months:
Still going great - no issues if you maintain according to the LED alerts. Having good counter space is key to enjoy it well."
4963,5.0,2020-03-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I love this machine! I had an older model Breville for over 12 years, so just got this one when it stopped performing as well. It’s so easy to use and the espresso comes out perfectly. Love love love.."
4964,5.0,2021-12-09, Brushed Stainless Steel,"We love our Breville! Great upgrade from De'Longhi and perfect for the 'at-home' barista. The setup was super easy and the brew quality is really good. However, it will take time to get that perfect brew. Lots to learn but that's what makes this espresso machine fun. It also comes with storage for all of the accessories. We love the built-in-grinder. This was recommended to us by friends that own a cafe and are micro-roasters. Worth the buy!"
4965,5.0,2015-11-12, Brushed Stainless Steel,Very easy to use right out of the box.
4966,5.0,2019-10-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,"I’m a barista with experience of 4+ years. Let me tell you something THIS MACHINE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.
I’ve been looking for something that can do latte art which means great quality espresso and milk frothing power. My budget was somewhere less than 1000bucks. After 3 weeks of using this machine, I finally get to love it!

I would recommend this for
- barista who wants to practice latte art
- coffee drinker who’s patient enough to learn
- anybody who spends so much $$ on coffee on daily basis and don’t want to keep going to coffee shop
- busy person who doesn’t have time to go coffee shop

Pros
-Exquisite quality espresso with CREMA!!
-Good milk frothing
-SUPER EASY TO CLEAN
-comes with built in burr grinder

Cons
-Takes awhile to dial in(get the right setting for espresso)
-kinda slow for frothing milk

Tips
-Read instruction first ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER.
-Baristas, it’s different from commercial grade so you still need to learn specifically how to use this machine
-Don’t give up just because you don’t get the good espresso. Be prepared to waste some coffee beans. Watch some YouTube video and learn how.
- CHANGE BURR GRINDER SETTING if you’re not making any difference in your espresso

*For your reference, I use 4 for the burr grinder and 3 or 4 for grind size for my coffee beans.
Picture is my little heart for ppl who wants to buy this. Good luck on your coffee journey and enjoy!"
4967,5.0,2022-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,I own 3 units We love it
4968,5.0,2018-01-27, Brushed Stainless Steel,"Ok so I bought this for my wife at Christmas, she loved it but would never buy it. I have never been to Starbucks, or had a latte or macchiato in my life, only Maxwell House brewed coffee my entire life.
We played with thing the first couple days with starbucks expresso beans, and finally got it tuned in, and so you know EVERY coffee bean will need its own setting and changing the internal burr grinder is very important cause you don't want the outside setting all the way down or all the way up. Changing the inside burr setting up or down is key to getting the perfect grind.
After going through maybe 6 different beans we settled on Peet's Major Dickons blend, when you find the perfect grind you will know by the taste and this blend is amazing for us. You need to keep up on the cleaning and filter changing, that stuff is supper important.
This is the perfect machine for a beginner, or a pro. I now make myself vanilla lattes 3x a day and love the taste of my coffee. This machine is so easy to use, directions in the manual, and some YouTube videos will have you mastering coffee in no time. Needless to say it will be a beautiful piece in your kitchen, I highly recommend the Breville Barista Express!

**UPDATE 8 MONTHS LATER**
So this thing still runs great, I notice my shot pressure will start to change slightly when it needs a good cleaning. I take it all apart to clean everything, and run a Urinex E31 cleaning tablet through cleaning cycle then a complete descale cycle with Urinex ""DEZCAL"". AFTER THIS I ALWAYS FUSH A WHOLE TANK OF CLEAN WATER THROUGH JUST TO BE EXTRA SAFE. It always runs smooth for a couple months then it will start to tell me it's ready again when shot pressure fluctuates. 8 months with this machine and I'm over the moon happy with my purchase, I haven't had a cup of coffee since!"
4969,5.0,2017-06-16, Brushed Stainless Steel,"After learning how to set the grind, it will take some time. OMG! So amazing. I couldnt ask for a better machine at this price. Holy cow!!! I love it. Gonna save me tons of money. Thank you !!!!"
4970,4.0,2022-06-14, Brushed Stainless Steel,"My wife really likes this machine. However after working in a coffee shop she/we cannot figure out how to dial the thing in with the single wall filter. We get the dose and try every grind size. It either pools or runs way too fast. The double wall is easy but we can't help but feel we're leaving taste on the table. Maybe we're packing the grounds too heavy/light? Anyway, good product with a bit of a learning curve 👌"
4971,5.0,2020-01-01, Black Sesame,"Used one at a friend’s house.
Had to have one after using it.
Easy to use. Easy to clean.
Highly recommend.
Worth the price."

4976,5.0,2020-09-05, Brushed Stainless Steel,Freshly ground beans really do make a difference! The frother has good power and they made everything easy to use and clean.
4977,5.0,2020-05-11, Brushed Stainless Steel,This is hands down my favorite purchase yet
4978,5.0,2014-05-13, Brushed Stainless Steel,I love this machine. Makes awesome coffee just like in a cafe. Froth the milk pretty good. I don’t need to go to a Starbucks Anymore.
4979,5.0,2022-07-02, Brushed Stainless Steel,"If you’re a coffee person, you can’t go wrong buying this! You can’t get close to to a “Starbucks iced macchiatto” without it!"

 I wanted this for a long time. Waited for the discount promotion. Finally I got it for a cheaper price, even its just a little.
I love this espresso machine, every morning I wake up just for getting a homemade Cappuccino from it, it’s my getting up motivation."

4982,5.0,2020-01-18, Brushed Stainless Steel,Great so far
4983,5.0,2013-11-12, Black Sesame,Bought this for my adult son. Loved it. Moved away to the UK for his studies and couldn’t live without it so he wanted another machine - and chose this same one again. Has held up to his daily abuse for more than two years now.
