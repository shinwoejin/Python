       " 'Review': ['\"Is this a good coffee maker?\" Well, that\\'s going to depend upon your expectations in coffee.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a \"pod coffee maker\" that makes normal drip coffee (think Keurig) then Nespresso is somewhat different, and may or may not meet your expectations.\\n\\nI also have a Keurig. It\\'s just fine for brewing basic, cheap coffee (or more expensive if you buy major-brand-name capsules). I like my Keurig--we\\'ve had it for over 5 years, and it works great. But, those who are environmentally conscious will soon realize that Keurig is not recyclable at all, and countless billions of pods a year are making their way into landfills.\\n\\nNespresso\\'s pods are made of 100% recycled/recyclable aluminum. Nespresso is VERY focused on a goal of 100% recycle-ability, and provides recycling bags with fully pre-paid shipping. Fill the bag (holds about 75-100 capsules), seal it, and drop it off at your nearest UPS store (or Nespresso store/kiosk if you happen to have one in a mall nearby). Nespresso will dismantle the pods, collect all the used grounds and process it into compost for landscaping use, and then melt down the pods and recycle them. 100% recycled!\\n\\nAll those recycling costs are already built in to the pod cost, so while these pods are more expensive than Keurig, there is ZERO waste as long as the consumer does their job.\\n\\nThe best way I can describe Nespresso is it\\'s a totally new coffee \"experience.\" Espresso or \"foo foo coffee\" lovers will likely be very pleased with this machine line. Folks who aren\\'t impressed with anything beyond a drip cup may find Nespresso a little \"snooty\" for them.\\n\\nNespresso\\'s Vertuo product produces coffee that is much more similar to a cup of espresso. The pods are spun at variable RPM\\'s (typically 3000 - 7000RPM) and use \"centrifusion\" - a made up word intended to commingle \"centrifugal force\" and \"infusion\". Basically, they spin the pod, a pump squirts in water, and the spinning forces produce the coffee which is extracted and drips into the cup. It\\'s not particularly noisy for a kitchen appliance, but you can definitely hear the spinning. Regardless of pod, they all come out with a layer of crema (coffee foam). There are (at the moment) five \"sizes\" of pods, which produce 1.5oz (espresso) up through 14 oz (\"Alto XL\").\\n\\nAs with any product line, there are pros and cons. There are some fantastic things about Vertuo and a few limitations.\\n\\nPros: Absolutely fantastic coffee. All cups have a crema layer on them, and there are a relatively plentiful number of flavors and intensities available, ranging from lighter and fruitier/acidic flavors all the way up to very dark bold and smoky options. There are seasonal special pods as well, such as holiday blends or single-origin \"master\" type coffees. Pods and contents are 100% recyclable. Easy to use out of the box--there\\'s ONE button. You press it. It works. Milk frother (optional add-on, included in our purchase) is FANTASTIC. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but I use it with every cup! It\\'s easy to use, and creates that \"latte experience\"--it makes better lattes\\' than a certain really large chain whose name ends with \"bucks\"--yeah, you\\'ll spend \\'em there. Pod cost, compared to an espresso shop brewing an equivalent latte for you, is cheap. VERY tightly-integrated recycling: drop pods in bag. Bag full? Seal it and drop it off at your UPS store. Pre-paid return shipping means zero-extra cost. Done. Milk frother is VERY easy to clean--takes about 15 seconds, if that. I\\'ve only owned the machine for a month, but the build and overall experience lends itself to belief this is a very high-quality unit. Excellent app (iOS/Android)---you can view/order/manage pods, accessories, maintenance/cleaning products and subscriptions right from your phone/tablet. Love a particular flavor? Just add it to your cart. It even supports automatic/routine replenishment if you want that. Seasonal and other specials show up in the app when available, making the app a one-stop-shop. Company is VERY plugged in environmentally and has created a coffee experience that doesn\\'t fill a landfill. If you actually play the game the way Nespresso intends, it\\'s a holistic coffee experience and a great one at that.\\n\\nCons: No third-party pods, and pods are relatively expensive when compared to other \"pod\" brewing standards. You want this machine? You\\'ll be buying Nespresso-branded pods from Nespresso, or authorized resellers, and at full-tilt retail which typically runs about $0.90 for an Espresso pod and up to $1.20 for their normal coffees (some origins are as high as $2.00 a pod). So each cup is roughly double the cost of a Keurig brew. There are about 20 different pod flavors and five sizes available, so most people will find SOMETHING they like, but if you don\\'t love one of the 20, you\\'re out of luck as there are no 3rd-party options without \"hacking together\" a used pod, some self-ground coffee, and some foil cap stickers you found on the Internet.\\n\\nOverall, this is an EXCELLENT machine for those who want more than a pod of coffee. I\\'ve owned it for a month and I\\'m 100% hooked.',\n",
       "  'We have used this machine daily since purchase 3 months ago and love it. I can back to write a review because of the quality of Nespresso customer service. The machine didn’t brew today and I called the support line after trying the online troubleshooting tips without success. My call was answered by a live, pleasant and helpful person after two rings! She used a one way video call to see the machine and walked me through a few different steps that fixed the issue. So refreshing!',\n",
       "  'I’m loving this machine! I’ve had many different ones, I’m currently away at work and can’t use my Jura. This little thing is amazing for the price! And the milk frother I love so much!

       "  'This is the best purchase! My fiancé and I use this every single day. The machine is easy to use and the espresso pods are delicious. We used to get Starbucks every morning and we’ve saved so much money now that we use this machine. We make an iced caramel macchiato and it’s tastes better than Starbucks in our option. I’ve convinced both of my sisters to buy one and they love it as well! Would definitely recommend.',\n",

What\\'s not to like?',\n",
       "  \"Moved to keurig not for the convenience but for the environmental impact. As long as the cups are recycled, it uses less energy and less water than the drip and bunn machines. That said, i had sacrificed a good cup of coffee for this. Then i was gifted a KCafe which includes the frother, and options opened up, but the coffee remained so so.\\n\\nSo, then a friend tells me about this beauty!! OMG!! Not only does it brew a strong, delicious cup of real coffee, the pods are fully recyclable- through the company. The machine has a lovely form factor, and is a pleasure to use!! It’s quiet, and quick. I’m no fan of Starbucks burnt coffee, i prefer my coffee tasty, and this was surprisingly smooth, nutty, and delicious.\\n\\nAlso, when you go to the website, there is a nice selection of flavors to choose from. And yes, you can get hot water from it (press the button three times). Would I recommend? Heck yeah.\\n\\nHappy camper, trying to convince myself that a cup of coffee at 11pm is cool, lol.\\n\\n7/22- just wanted to add! My aerocinno3 suddenly stopped frothing my milk this week, after months of working beautifully. I called Nespresso, and not only to I learn about my machine, but i also learned that sometimes a bad carton milk will cause issues. Here i am cursing the machine, reading all the negative reviews and then as soon as I swap to a new jug of milk... It's working it's magic again! I just wanted to stop by and encourage anyone who's skeptical- take a moment to do some digging, this machine is awesome and the support at the company is superb! Still a happy camper!\",\n",
       "  \"I bought this with skepticism. I was used to toying with the wands on expensive espresso machines, struggling to make froth. But my skepticism was misplaced. This simple device is a breeze and the quality of the froth it makes it simply superb: Pour in milk (I've even used goat milk), press the button and a minute later the Vertuo has made a cup of froth that would please the best barista. An easy 5 stars.\",\n",

There are 3 different size pods/cups (espresso, double espresso and coffee), and the machine detects that and makes it with the correct amount of water. The pods are not too bad. Range from $10-$20 for a pack of 10 pods on their website. Perfect for an espresso martini too!',\n",

The Aeroccino is an absolute must. I have now tried many types of coffee. I have found those I’ve preferred but even those I haven’t have been excellent, just too strong for my taste. I LOVE the guide describing the intensity and other descriptors of the coffees, and they are on the mark. One critical comment: please consider shipping coffee in an unmarked box! I’m grateful no one took my box from my stoop while I was at work considering NESPRESSO was prominently displayed on the box.',\n",

The result is the perfect cup of expresso, cappuccino, or Americana, whatever your heart desires. The warmer/froth machine that came with it is exactly as amazing.

I have had nothing but great results and have not one negative comment about them... I read reviews that said the frother didn\\'t make enough noise so he didn\\'t know it was done - it has a light that goes on when you push the button to start it, and it goes off when it\\' s done. I find that the timing of making the coffee and milk frothing is almost exactly the same (open the unit, put new pod in, close unit and as it warms up to start, put milk in frother and the maker is then ready to go - start them both and they finish about the same time. I find that low fat milks froth just fine despite what other reviews have said (I use 1% most of the time). LOVE that it senses the \"size\" of the coffee/espresso pods and brews with the appropriate amount of water (you don\\'t have to push a button to choose a size - but you can push the start button again if you want to dilute it). LOVE that the pods are recyclable and that the company provides postage free collection bags for that. LOVE the variety of coffees and espressos available (even by the mermaid brand), and last but not least, I get to think of George Clooney every morning as I make my coffee/espresso! P.S. I recently bought the \"Double Wall Glass Coffee mugs, (4-Pcak) 12 Ounces-Clear Glass Coffee Cups\" so I could see how beautiful the drinks were as they are made, making the \"event\" each morning even more enjoyable!',\n",

I then purchased the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and haven't looked back. I am very pleased with the quality of coffee it produces. I even refill my own pods and I am amazed at how the coffee still tastes so good! I did a taste test comparison using the same coffee in a regular coffee pot vs the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and it does make a difference! Nespresso brews a less bitter coffee! I also love the Aeroccino, I use it daily and I love that you can do a hot or cold foam. I recommend it to anyone looking for a single serve coffee machine. It is 100% worth it!\",\n",

I needed something that would satisfy my \"boujee\" coffee lifestyle but still give my partner the ability to have his lam..... I mean normal coffee. The price of the pods, milk, and syrups are nothing in comparison to paying $5-7 for one latte 2-3 times a day.\\n\\nLet me break it down (If you drink lattes every day):\\n- $3-5 for a gallon of lactose free milk that last me a week and a half or so\\n- $3-5 for vanilla syrup\\n- $1.5-3 for caramel or chocolate syrup (You don\\'t need to get the high end stuff.

The hardest thing you\\'ll have to do with all of this is find out what your favorite coffee roast is.

These are amazingly fresh and sealed so that the coffee tastes way better than K-cups from Petes or Starbucks. The machine is fast and even discards the pods into a container so it doesn't stand around all day, with the taste of the old and used grounds going into your next cup. The coffee will be a bit pricier and you will have to reorder from their website. It will average around $1.00-1.30 per coffee or espresso. But to be honest, to get this quality of coffee this fast right at your place is well worh it. I've had world famous coffee for example in Colombia, and their stuff is pretty close, obviously not as if you're there but the taste is surprisingly good. Can't go back to K-pods, ever.

Delicious coffee within seconds every morning – it actually makes me look forward to morning time, and so much variety!! It probably sounds like I\\'m affiliated with Keurig but I\\'m not, and I\\'m not being paid for this review. I just don\\'t understand why Nespresso has such a following (I had tried this out because a friend told me that it\\'s waaay better than Keurig, and that is definitely not true).\\n\\nHigh-level faults before getting into the fraud/scam details:\\n1. It is very difficult to use. I work in tech, and love tech gadgets. With this thing, it\\'s ridiculously difficult to figure out how to make a cup of coffee. I had to watch numerous YouTube videos. The amount of different combinations of button presses for each different function is just crazy. For example \"tap the coffee button three times within 2 seconds, hold two buttons for more than 3 seconds, then tap the coffee button to confirm. Then a green light will flash three times, followed by a solid orange light...\". I can pretty much guarantee you won\\'t even be able to open the machine to put a pod in there without watching a YouTube video.\\n2. There is a VERY limited selection of coffees. While every coffee company out there makes pods for Keurig machines, Nespresso machines read a barcode on each pod, and will not do anything unless the pod is from Nespresso or Starbucks.\\n3. The coffee is just meh. I don\\'t know what all the great reviews are about.\\n\\nNow for the fraud part – seriously, there\\'s a whole reddit thread about suing Nespresso for this:\\n\\nI received my Nespresso Vertuo Plus today and was very disappointed to find out (after a lot of frustrating, time-wasting troubleshooting and researching) that the largest coffee it can make is 7.7oz, even though Nespresso says this machine can make up to 14oz coffees. However, Nespresso has discontinued the Alto/XL pods that are required to make 14oz coffees, but they still say everywhere that they can make up to 14oz. The whole reason I decided to give Nespresso a try is because they very loudly market the fact that this can make large cups of coffee (like a Keurig can), but it\\'s literally not possible in this machine because when it reads a barcode on each pod, it uses the amount of water that\\'s recommended for that pod. So, without the Alto/XL pods (which no longer exist, but you won\\'t see that update in any of their documentation or YouTube videos), you cannot make a coffee that\\'s larger than 7.7oz unless you use multiple pods, which would be stupid because the pods are already more expensive than their competitors. Nespresso even has a YouTube video that shows how to make a large cup of coffee in this machine by manually programming the amount of water to use. I tried this with one of the other pods (not Alto/XL), and even though I kept my finger on the button like they said, it still stopped at 7.7oz. They should clearly say that you can only make a maximum of 7.7oz because they no longer support the 14oz pods.\\n\\nFinal thoughts:\\nI\\'m originally from Europe but I\\'ve lived in the US for a few years. When I go into a coffee shop in the US, it\\'s most common to see people ordering at least 12oz or 16oz coffees. Tiny little coffees are great in Europe, but Nespresso is being really stupid for making the majority of their machines not cater for the US market, which is one of the biggest markets in the world for coffee consumption.',\n",

The attraction of the older model is 3rd party coffee pods, which saves money but after watching many a youtube review, it appeared the vertuso produced a better coffee with more crema. I opted for the vertuso plus deluxe. The deluxe model has a larger water tank and chrome accents.\\n\\nThe machine was simple to set up. Just fill the water tank, plug it in, make sure it had a container under the spout, and it went through a priming/rinsing cycle. The machine comes with 12 sample pods, each different. I immediately made a coffee and it was amazing! The flavor was excellent. It was more impressive than my expensive espresso machine (likely due to my choice of beans). I've since had several drinks from the machine and am pleased with each. The machine knows the right amount of water, brew time, brew temp for each pod, due to the bar codes. I no longer need to use 2 k-cups to get a decent cup of coffee, so the price per cup ends up the same as the Keurig. I spent about $.50 per k-cup, and each nespresso capsule is about $1. The brew time is longer than the Keurig, but shorter than my espresso machine (however, my machine grinds the beans for each cup).\\n\\nI love this machine. I immediately ordered more sleeves of pods from nespresso's website. My order was shipped the next day and arrived 2 days later! Also, the machine comes with a $10 coupon for pods and you get samples with each order.\\n\\nThis machine is fantastic. I have given it 5 stars. It is worth the price, if you like quality coffee. Not even Starbuck's makes a better espresso! Buy it!\",\n",

It was a mad dash to turn it off.\\n\\nNext, there’s the matter of the pods. More so the attainability and availability of them. Williams Sonoma sells the original line but for some reason Nestle hasn’t released the the vertuo line to them yet, which, suffice it to say, is stupid.\\n\\nShipping an online order directly from nespresso takes a minimum of 3 business days for my location, which, maybe I’m spoiled by amazon, but not a fan of that.\\n\\nAaaaaand, seasonal creations sell out FAST, so you gotta pay attention to those emails, folks. Don’t sit on them.\\n\\nAlso, Nespresso boutiques are hard to come by. I live in a major metroplex and there’s only one about 90 minutes from me. If they’re going to be stingy about how many locations they have, why not allow Williams Sonoma to handle some of that retail?\\n\\nBottom line, it’s DECADENT coffee but it’s a bit of a pain in the ass to obtain.',\n",

       "  'I waited to write this review after seeing some comments in other reviews that the machine enters a descaling mode and breaks about three months in. Well, I\\'ve had my machine since Christmas (gift to myself) and I\\'ve had no such problem. I\\'ve been enjoying my coffee ritual so much now that I also bought a milk frother, but not the nespresso branded one as that seems too expensive. I love that I can make any coffee drink I desire. I love the different size pods, and how you can program each pod size to brew a certain volume of coffee. My favorite pods are the alto pods, which is new with this machine. And I love that I can feel good about having \"pod coffee\" again with their pod recycling program.\\nNow, about descaling. Last week, I descaled my machine for the first time and had no problems and the coffee is back to tasting like new. I thought the machine would warn me when it needed to be descaled, but 5 months in I never got the warning and figured I better be proactive. I\\'ve been using filtered water in the machine, so maybe that held off some of the buildup. I find coffee tastes better with filtered water anyway.\\nBut, the machine was getting noisier, and the coffee was starting to sputter when coming out of the spout, so I thought it might be time to descale. So I used one of their descaling packs and followed the directions in my manual. The machine did its thing and now I\\'m back to like new operation with less noise again and more flavor for about a week. I wonder if perhaps the problems people had are because the machine\\'s setting lets the buildup get too bad before prompting you to descale.\\nLast tip is Nespresso has a wide range of coffee profiles, so I suggest trying sample packs (and always ordering your free 2-pack when ordering pods on the Nespresso site) to find the right flavor profile for you.

Also I love that you can recycle the coffee pods by sending the used coffee pods to Nespresso in a postage paid envelope. I love this easy method. With Keurig, although you get recyclable pods, you have to separate the coffee, throw it in the regular trash and then dispose the remaining pack in the recycling bin. With this, you dump all the used pods in the postage paid envelope, pack it once its full and drop it at a nearby UPS.\\nThe only downside if the cost of the pods. It comes to approximately a dollar to $1.5 per cup depending on the coffee and the deals/coupons you get. But this is gourmet coffee and something I drink only once a day (twice if I had a long day).

       "  ' April 28, 2019\\nReview of Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De\\'Longhi with Aeroccino, Grey\\nPROS\\nThe coffee tastes better than starbucks or anywhere that makes it. It creates a frothy foam on the top of the coffee and really makes it an excellent cup. This is about 10x better than kureg as far as taste. Initial setup was easy out of the box. First cups were perfect and the machine made them without issue.\\nCONS\\nAfter about 2 months we have run into a few problems. The machine does not consistently work and continues to throw out the error code of \"no water\" or \"water container empty\" even when there is water in it. See the video for proof. After about 10-15 attempt it works and makes a cup. Luckily it doesn\\'t reject the pod and it can be reused (even though it doesn\\'t really even use it). Note this doesn\\'t happen every time and usually it is the 2nd cup of the day that we end up fighting with the machine on. The other major complaint I have about this machine is precisely the way it tells you the error code. There is no display which code show a code. In stead you have to watch the flashing light and count how many red or green lights flash and how long they stay eliminated. Then you have to use the manual to look up the red/green code. Why can\\'t you just have a $2 display that shows the status of the machine...WOW! What century are we in...lets make the error code reading as complicated at we can that way the user has to guess at the actual problem. Come on nespresso! Even a $5 calculator has a digital display. OK, back to the issue. As you can see on the video there is water in the carafe yet the machine continue to through an error. We are getting more and more frustrated by the cup. I will leave the rating at 3 stars but only because the coffee is so damn good.... when it does create a cup full.\\n\\nUPDATE 5/11/2019\\nOk. Now we are going down to 1-star (from 3). The machine makes the first cup every morning just fine. The 2nd cup NEVER works. The \"refill water\" light flashing comes on after you press the button to start the 2nd cup. I called customer service at Amazon and because we are over the 30-day window (actually 35) Amazon won\\'t take it back. They patch me into Nespresso hot-line and then Nespresso wants to troubleshoot the problem, all over again. After talking to two people at Nespresso and arguing over what the red flashing light means and actually reading the manual to the Nespresso person on the phone she finally agrees to \"repair\" the machine. At first she wanted to ONLY send an empty UPS box so the machine could be sent to be \"repaired by a technician\". She told me that process would take about 2-weeks. I told her that was unacceptable and I needed coffee. She reluctantly agreed to send a \"loaner\" machine that we could use while our machine is \"being repaired\". After an hour with her on the phone I was ready to give up. It was apparent she had a \"protocol\" that she had to follow in order to reduce the returns and get customers to give-up because their customer service process is too complicated or there is too much push-back from the representative. I\\'m overall very disappointed with Nespresso and wish I would have purchased the machine at the local target. At-least then I could just take it back or buy another one and then take this one back. Nespresso you need to whole-heartedly stand behind your product for greater than 35 days and not give your customers the run-around. Think about how many people I\\'m going to tell about my experience with your product and the poor customer service. Also, add a digital display to the machine, it can\\'t cost more than a free calculator display. A real code to read instead of a flashing light to count flashes like morse code would REALLY help your customers AND your customer service representatives in troubleshooting the errors...DUHH!',\n",

I quickly returned that purchase and bought the vertuoline.\\n\\nThere are two versions / manufacturers of the nespresso vertuoline--- 1) DeLonghi (this one) and 2) Breville. I chose the DeLonghi version exclusively for the swivel water tank feature. Aside from this functional difference they appear to be identical aside from design appearance. I'm really glad I went with this one as it really comes in handy having the tank on same side as sink. I've even moved the machine to opposite side and swiveled the tank to accommodate it.\\n\\nIts important to note that this machine uses vertuoline size round pods ONLY. You cannot view the small espresso capsules. There is a line of espresso capsules that fit this machine however the selection is more limited than the original Nespresso line (it is however growing).\\n\\nBefore purchasing I read many reviews which mention a problem with the water temp being too cool. This comes down to preference- I would say this pumps out sufficiently hot coffee for my liking. I noticed the second consecutive cup brews a bit warmer than the first cup (maybe the machine warms up). Nespresso told us that you can prime the machine by brewing a cup of plain water first-- this hasn't been necessary -- my hubby prefers his coffee extra hot so I always brew my cup first and his second. He's had no complaints and doesn't need to microwave it for additional heat.\\n\\nThe frother is also great- Try using low fat or no fat milk for the best front. I tried half and half and it doesn't foam near as well. I wish the container had a lip to pour from but that's my only feedback.\\n\\nI seen a Nespresso demo years ago at Target and I wish I had taken the leap sooner. In the bay area I had a daily Philz coffee 4$ day habit and I haven't been once since this purchase. My favorite capsule is the Giornio. Add a splash of heavy whipping cream for perfection.

I haven't found anything that I don't like about the machine. I purchased the one with the milk frother because that is something that I enjoy.\\n\\nSome of the reviews stated that the coffee was not hot. With the frother, you can froth your milk or cream. If you don't like froth, I would just microwave my cream in the coffee cup to heat it a little before brewing the coffee or just microwave the cup for a few seconds to take the chill off.\\n\\nThe Nespresso recycling program is especially easy and attractive for the consumer. The pods, in which the coffee comes, are aluminum. The company supplies free recycling bags which are already prepared with shipping label and shipping fee. All you have to do is put the used pods in the supplied bag, close (bag is self sealing), and drop at UPS. Easy peasy. When you order your coffee pods, if you need recycling bags you add them to your shopping cart for free. I love how this company has made recycling of their product easy and seamless for the consumer.\",\n",

       "  \"Based on reviews, I expected to obtain a superior cup of coffee. (I had been buying Starbucks.) It takes a while to sort though all the flavors to find one that is acceptable, not necessarily better than other coffee brands. Additionally, you have to get used to foamy coffee, similar to a latte. If you put cream or milk in your coffee, the coffee temperature may be too cool. The directions indicate that you should put the milk in first and stir the mixture when ready. However, I still need to put the cup in the microwave for 20 seconds to obtain a hot cup of coffee. Finally, the cost of the pods is more than I expected. Each pod costs $1.00 +. There is also a difference in the amount of coffee provided per pod. Unfortunately, the flavor my husband likes only provides a half a cup of coffee. You have to consider the flavor as well as the size of the pod in making a selection. He also has to add sugar to improve the flavor, which he had not needed to do before. Therefore, the cost-value benefit of this system may be an issue depending on your coffee preferences. I found that there are just too many usage restrictions and adaptations. I suggest that you view the YouTube presentations before buying or using this coffee system for the first time. There is a link on the Nespresso website. The videos are very good and will help in understanding how this system works. Additionally, Nespresso's customer service and delivery system are excellent. They do provide a wide variety of flavors and coffee types.\",\n",

Since I’ve been using the machine and don’t want to deal with the hassle of returning it I’ll have to reach out to the seller to see if they will ship a whisk to me.\\n\\nI first tried Nespresso at my friends and liked it but wanted a larger quantity than an espresso. I didn’t know that there are machines that brew larger quantities, 8oz and 14oz.\\n\\nYeah it’s not as cheap as brewing a cup of coffee but I wasn’t doing that either. Instead I was buying a cup every day at work for $2. So for me it’s cheaper.\\n\\nI have to say the coffee is much better tasting than Keriug, not sure if I spelled that correctly, and Starbucks.\\n\\nThe machine is very easy to use. Push up on the lever to open, the motorized lid opens, drops the spent pod at the same time, install the new pod, press down on the lever to close, and push the button at top to start.\\n\\nThe milk frothier is extremely easy to use. Pour in the milk to one of the two fill lines, close and press the button. Since I only have the one whisk I’ve only filled it to the lower level and frothed hot milk for hot drinks. I haven’t used it yet, but if you press and hold the button for 2 seconds you can froth milk for cold drinks. Hot the button flashes red and cold it flashes blue. Pretty smart.\\n\\nIf you are considering this machine, what are you waiting for?\\n\\nUpdate 12/17/17: The instructions are not the most detailed, but I did notice that the provided whisk can be converted by removing the spring. In the lid there is a spring storage bracket when you are using the whisk without the spring. Therefore, the package came complete and I’ve upgraded my rating to 5 stars.

I’ll put the top down and it’ll continue beeping green so then I have to take the pod out and reinsert and I’ll have to redo this process 3-4 sometimes more until it works. This means I’ll have to take the back off so I can catch the pod before it goes with the used ones. It’s just a hassle and not what I expect from a brand new coffee maker. Today was the final nail for me writing this review as I opened the machine to make coffee today and yesterday’s pod got STUCK on top so I had to remove the back (which had only one used pod in it as I just cleaned it) and then it fell and I was able to put the new pod in and go through with the stupid putting it in, closing machine, having to reopen and catch the pod before it goes to the back, then replace it, hope it works or continue this cycle till it does.

I realized that because I usually make a morning latte that has two espresso shots in it (ie. two of the capsules) I would be better off with a machine that makes coffee too, so I got this one. I LOVE the coffee. Make no mistake: this machine is NOTHING like a keurig, and if you like keurig coffee, this is NOT for you. This machine makes strong, lucious coffee with crema on the top, which I love, and it also makes espresso. If you regularly go out for coffee at a place like Starbucks or somewhere else that makes fancy coffee drinks, you'll love this, but if you're after the kind of insipid drink that passes for coffee in a lot of the US, this will not be for you. I had given up on drinking drip coffee completely, because it's usually not strong/tasty enough for me, so I alternate between making a cold brew myself and this machine, and it keeps me going.\\n\\nOne small nitpick: I actually like the espresso from my old machine a bit more, because my old one had no auto-shut off, and I could adjust the strength of the espresso to my own purposes.

We are potentially without coffee for about 3 weeks so we will be using Mr. Coffee in the meantime to fill the void.\\n\\nHonestly we are expecting the 3rd machine to eventually break, which is a shame because this is a great machine when it works. It\\'s hard to go back to Mr. Coffee that we are willing to put up with this product as long as the warranty covers replacements but I do not recommend this product.\\n\\nI think alot of the positive reviews are from users who may not have come back to update their initial 4/5 star reviews.\\n\\nPlease try googling \"Vertuo Plus leaking\" as well.',\n",

       "  'Good luck getting Vertuoline coffee anywhere else except Amazon. Your local big box stores don\\'t carry it. What\\'s Vertuoline coffee you ask? Well, it\\'s these newer giant pods from Nespresso. When I bought this machine, I should have better educated myself, because these things are both rare and expensive comparably to K-Cups etc.\\n\\nThe good is that the coffee it does produce is excellent. Tastes good, high caffeine (if that\\'s what you\\'re into) and just works. It expels the pod neatly into it\\'s little trash bin behind it, which is good for an office setting like ours. It also heats up relatively quickly compared to Kcup machines we\\'ve had in the past. It also uses aluminum pods, which for those BPA-phobic out there, I\\'m sure is a very good thing and perhaps worth the premium. Machine also looks good, is easy to clean, and works perhaps too simply, literally it\\'s so simple that people get confused operating it.\\n\\nThe bad is expensive pods that are hard to find. Also we still haven\\'t figured out how to get it to dispense just hot water for tea, hot cocoa, etc. When we do, it goes into \"cleaning\" mode and dispenses pretty much all the hot water.\\n\\nAnyways, we got the machine on sale, it makes good tasting coffee so it\\'s worth it for some. I wouldn\\'t buy it again or necessarily recommend it for the simple reason you\\'re locked into their rare Vertuo line crapola. If this somehow becomes as mainstream as Kcups, then cool, but I\\'ve seen no sign of that and quite honestly the opposite. For the price of the Vertuo line pods, you\\'re pretty close to a cup at McDonalds/Sbux to begin with, so it\\'s hard to justify the expense.',\n",

In other words, if you want to make your coffee, pour it in a to-go mug, load your things in the car and take the trash out, by the time you pull out of your driveway, you will need to drink your coffee all at once if you want it warm at all.

I haven’t been as impressed with the flavor of the coffee sized pods, but the espresso and double espressos are fantastic. The coffees taste more like a regular Keurig, although maybe a little more flavorful. If I’m making coffee for 2 or more, I’ll do pour over, because it’s just better and not particularly messy.

So you're left wondering if you pressed the button hard enough, or maybe need to press it twice just in case.. until the coffee starts.\\n\\n-- Sometimes the pods get stuck on the rails while sliding back into the pod container.\\n\\n-- The pod container is solid black and can't see what's inside, until it's completely full and it is overflowing.\\n\\nNow after about 6 months it started leaking somewhere internally and won't turn on anymore.\\n\\nI see much better reviews on the older model Vertuo Evoluo (ENV135GY). That one has a transparent pod container on the side. I'm going to try that model as a replacement.\\n\\nNespresso needs to make better machines. Nespresso Vertuo produces a superior tasting coffee compared to Keurig, but unfortunately the new Keurig K-Supreme Plus blows this away in quality, features, and overall design.\",\n",
       "  'This is a great machine. It makes my espresso daily my wife coffee and decaf. I appreciate that it automatically detects whatever type of pod is inserted and adjusts the water accordingly. The used pods are recyclable, so we just bag them up and send them back to the manufacturer (free postage), so this product generates no trash beyond the packaging it ships in. It’s easy to clean and maintain; we’ve had no problems in 8 months of daily use.\\n\\nThe pods cost about 85 cents each, which is a little more than the grounds for a conventional espresso machine, but it takes no time to prepare or clean up. We’re all busy, and no one wants to spend three minutes washing coffee grounds out of all the crevices of their machine.

That's it.\\n\\nSave your self the time and money. The expensive coffee machine gives you the feeling of making a better expresso coffee but you really aren't. Nespresso capsules are actually very fresh and sealed in aluminum for freshness so Dont mix it up with the k cups, which are in plastic. The freshness and the brew of this coffee maker is side by side with the $500+ coffee machines.\\n\\nExcept this is much easier and faster to use. They took a $500+ coffee machine, made it simple and faster to use with coffee ready to go in capsules with the perfect size of coffee printed on the barcode on the capsules themselves. And made the whole machine affordable to everyone.\",\n",
       "  \"You have to ask yourself... Do you feel lucky? It seems that the seals on some of these that fit the top of the coffee pod randomly go hard and crack letting the coffee escape as the pod is spun. You'll know if you're one of the unlucky few if you start getting coffee down the back of the machine and all over your counter. If you're really unlucky like me, it will be just out of warranty and they'll want $125 to fix it or they'll give you a discount on a new one after accusing you of being the problem because you didn't clean the machine ONCE A WEEK. Who does that?. In any case, neither is really an acceptable solution to what is definitely a design flaw. My old Tossimo worked for 11 years and I only switched to this machine because I couldn't find the pods for that one anywhere anymore. So, my recommendation is to run in the other direction. Buy a different model, buy a Keurig, buy a drip coffee maker... Or if you're feeling lucky, roll the dice. I wish you luck!\\n\\nUpdate: I liked the coffee enough that we rolled the dice and bought a new Virtuoline Next machine. This machine is engineered MUCH BETTER. They basically gave-up on trying to stop the system from leaking and just engineered the new machine to manage the leaks. Now, any leaking flows into a little cup under the spent pod storage. So, even if the machine leaks, at least it won't get all over your counter like the VirtuoPlus machines do. Basically, in my mind, this is an admission that the VirtuoPlus machines have a major leak issue, and their refusal to acknowledge this or address it a few months past the warranty is poor business. Run away from this particular model. Buy a VirtuoNext. You'll lose the motorized lid, but you won't miss it, and you'll save yourself a ton of mess and money when the machine inevitably starts leaking.\",\n",

I was told that Nespresso offers loaners but for some reason the company said they can't send me one because they have none to give out. I am now left with lots of coffee pods and no machine.

If you do purchase this, open an account with Nespresso on their website so you get the great customer service.

So the simple math is that this coffee cost me between $780 - $1,300 per year based on 3 - 5 cups per day, with 260 workdays a year.\\n\\nIf you pay $400 more up-front for a real espresso machine with frother, the taste obviously won't be compromised. In fact, you will have a much wider variety of coffee selections and strength options available to you. But more importantly, the coffee will only cost you about $375 per year max for higher end coffee choices - and more cups in a day. So the higher costing machines pay for themselves well within a year, and then the savings goes on for all future years.\\n\\nYou can opt to use the $900+ per year savings on something far more intelligent. That is of course unless you actually like paying well over double what you should for the barely noticeable convenience of a pre-packed pod (takes me 30 seconds).

They wanted me to send it back, they\\'d check it out, fix it - THE SAME MACHINE - and return it. You know, about one or two months, right? No espresso machine, no replacement... just have their \"technician\" tinker with it.

       "  \"I've owned two of Nespresso's classic coffee machines. I like in particular the ability to use refillable coffee capsules, where I can use high quality expresso like Intelligensia's Black Cat beans. The Vertuo coffee system of Nespresso was supposed to be an improvement on the classic system. Our experience with this machine has been anything but positive. My guess is that Nespresso is trying to suppress the customization of capsules, and require that all capsules be purchased directly from Nespresso. So, the idea is that Nespresso uses centrifugal forces (high speed spinning) to extract coffee... brewing parameters are adjusted for each capsule, using the barcode data to regulate the flow and volume of water, as well as temperature, infusion time and capsule rotation speed, which is a process Nespresso says helps to produce a rich crema. In fact, this machine consistently produces bitter, foul coffee (but the crema looks good). Cleaning doesn't help, nor does any other adjustment documented in the manual. You can't buy refillable capsules that allow you to use your own coffee, either ... this is probably the main reason that Nespresso switched to the Vertuo system. The older classical system has become hard to find, which was a big reason for taking a gamble on their new Vertuo system.\",\n",

I’m thinking I may have received a used, or broken machine as well. When I received my package, it looked like the box was worn, weathered, and previously opened.

After 30 minutes of manipulating a toothpick, a toothbrush and warm sudsy water, we got nowhere. The final solution? Either send the $134.25 machine to get fixed for a fee of $125 or purchase a replacement machine at \"25% discount\"--which, by the way, was the exact same price listed on Amazon.

       "['\"Is this a good coffee maker?\" Well, that\\'s going to depend upon your expectations in coffee.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a \"pod coffee maker\" that makes normal drip coffee (think Keurig) then Nespresso is somewhat different, and may or may not meet your expectations.\\n\\nI also have a Keurig. It\\'s just fine for brewing basic, cheap coffee (or more expensive if you buy major-brand-name capsules). I like my Keurig--we\\'ve had it for over 5 years, and it works great. But, those who are environmentally conscious will soon realize that Keurig is not recyclable at all, and countless billions of pods a year are making their way into landfills.\\n\\nNespresso\\'s pods are made of 100% recycled/recyclable aluminum. Nespresso is VERY focused on a goal of 100% recycle-ability, and provides recycling bags with fully pre-paid shipping. Fill the bag (holds about 75-100 capsules), seal it, and drop it off at your nearest UPS store (or Nespresso store/kiosk if you happen to have one in a mall nearby). Nespresso will dismantle the pods, collect all the used grounds and process it into compost for landscaping use, and then melt down the pods and recycle them. 100% recycled!\\n\\nAll those recycling costs are already built in to the pod cost, so while these pods are more expensive than Keurig, there is ZERO waste as long as the consumer does their job.\\n\\nThe best way I can describe Nespresso is it\\'s a totally new coffee \"experience.\" Espresso or \"foo foo coffee\" lovers will likely be very pleased with this machine line. Folks who aren\\'t impressed with anything beyond a drip cup may find Nespresso a little \"snooty\" for them.\\n\\nNespresso\\'s Vertuo product produces coffee that is much more similar to a cup of espresso. The pods are spun at variable RPM\\'s (typically 3000 - 7000RPM) and use \"centrifusion\" - a made up word intended to commingle \"centrifugal force\" and \"infusion\". Basically, they spin the pod, a pump squirts in water, and the spinning forces produce the coffee which is extracted and drips into the cup. It\\'s not particularly noisy for a kitchen appliance, but you can definitely hear the spinning. Regardless of pod, they all come out with a layer of crema (coffee foam). There are (at the moment) five \"sizes\" of pods, which produce 1.5oz (espresso) up through 14 oz (\"Alto XL\").\\n\\nAs with any product line, there are pros and cons. There are some fantastic things about Vertuo and a few limitations.\\n\\nPros: Absolutely fantastic coffee. All cups have a crema layer on them, and there are a relatively plentiful number of flavors and intensities available, ranging from lighter and fruitier/acidic flavors all the way up to very dark bold and smoky options. There are seasonal special pods as well, such as holiday blends or single-origin \"master\" type coffees. Pods and contents are 100% recyclable. Easy to use out of the box--there\\'s ONE button. You press it. It works. Milk frother (optional add-on, included in our purchase) is FANTASTIC. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but I use it with every cup! It\\'s easy to use, and creates that \"latte experience\"--it makes better lattes\\' than a certain really large chain whose name ends with \"bucks\"--yeah, you\\'ll spend \\'em there. Pod cost, compared to an espresso shop brewing an equivalent latte for you, is cheap. VERY tightly-integrated recycling: drop pods in bag. Bag full? Seal it and drop it off at your UPS store. Pre-paid return shipping means zero-extra cost. Done. Milk frother is VERY easy to clean--takes about 15 seconds, if that. I\\'ve only owned the machine for a month, but the build and overall experience lends itself to belief this is a very high-quality unit. Excellent app (iOS/Android)---you can view/order/manage pods, accessories, maintenance/cleaning products and subscriptions right from your phone/tablet. Love a particular flavor? Just add it to your cart. It even supports automatic/routine replenishment if you want that. Seasonal and other specials show up in the app when available, making the app a one-stop-shop. Company is VERY plugged in environmentally and has created a coffee experience that doesn\\'t fill a landfill. If you actually play the game the way Nespresso intends, it\\'s a holistic coffee experience and a great one at that.\\n\\nCons: No third-party pods, and pods are relatively expensive when compared to other \"pod\" brewing standards. You want this machine? You\\'ll be buying Nespresso-branded pods from Nespresso, or authorized resellers, and at full-tilt retail which typically runs about $0.90 for an Espresso pod and up to $1.20 for their normal coffees (some origins are as high as $2.00 a pod). So each cup is roughly double the cost of a Keurig brew. There are about 20 different pod flavors and five sizes available, so most people will find SOMETHING they like, but if you don\\'t love one of the 20, you\\'re out of luck as there are no 3rd-party options without \"hacking together\" a used pod, some self-ground coffee, and some foil cap stickers you found on the Internet.\\n\\nOverall, this is an EXCELLENT machine for those who want more than a pod of coffee. I\\'ve owned it for a month and I\\'m 100% hooked.',\n",
       " 'We have used this machine daily since purchase 3 months ago and love it. I can back to write a review because of the quality of Nespresso customer service. The machine didn’t brew today and I called the support line after trying the online troubleshooting tips without success. My call was answered by a live, pleasant and helpful person after two rings! She used a one way video call to see the machine and walked me through a few different steps that fixed the issue. So refreshing!',\n",

       " 'Espresso as good as it gets. Don’t know what “blending power” means, but the machine itself blends in nicely with the decor of my book shelves of 17th manuscripts.\\n\\nAnd yes, it is quite easy to use if one has water and electricity handy, and the flavor, as suggested above, is nonpareil.']"
